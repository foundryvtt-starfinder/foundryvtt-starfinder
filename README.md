## Use

The Starfinder system borrows a lot of functionality from the `dnd5e` system, so most functions should seem familar if you've used that system. One of the big differences is with skills. Skills in Starfinder are more dynamic than they are in D&D 5e. Skills can have skill ranks and other miscellaneous modifers applied to them. To do this, right click on the skill name. This will bring up an edit dialog where you can apply these modifiers. You can also have multiple profession skills, all tied to different specialities or fields of study. You can add new ones by clicking the "Add Profession" button at the bottom of the skills panel. This will bring up a similar dialog where you can specify the linked ability, the number of ranks in the skill, any miscellaneous modifiers that might apply, and the name of the profession or speciality. 

If you have any issues or concerns, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the tracker [https://github.com/wildj79/foundryvtt-starfinder/issues](https://github.com/wildj79/foundryvtt-starfinder/issues) or reach out to me on the Foundry discord server: `wildj79#0980`.
