## Use

The Starfinder FoundryVTT system works similar to most of the other systems available on FoundryVTT, so if you have experience with FoundryVTT overall, you should have little difficulty using the Starfinder system. There are a few notable differences in the implementation details, either because of the way the system dictates things should function, or because of quality of life changes that have been integrated.

### Skills
Skills in Starfinder are more dynamic than they are in D&D 5e. Skills can have skill ranks and other miscellaneous modifiers applied to them. To view more detailed information on skills you can right click on the skill name. This will bring up an edit dialog where you can edit properties. You can also have multiple profession skills, all tied to different specialities or fields of study. You can add new ones by clicking the "Add Profession" button at the bottom of the skills panel. This will bring up a similar dialog where you can specify the linked ability, the number of ranks in the skill, any miscellaneous modifiers that might apply, and the name of the profession or speciality.

### Ability Score Increases
Because ability score increases in Starfinder work a little different than other systems, there is an 'asi' item you can add to your character where you select the ability scores to increase. This properly automates on the character sheet in the right order of operations, meaning that personal upgrades or ability score penalties, damages, and drains do not affect your ASI gains. The base ability score box on the player character sheet should include your original, level 1, original, rolled/point-bought/stat-array'ed score, before Race and Theme bonuses are applied.

### Inventory
The inventory in Starfinder has a few quality of life features. If you right-click a stack of items it will split the stack in half. If you drop identical items on top of each other, the stacks will merge. If you hold down the shift key when dropping an item, the game will ask you how many of the item you wish to drop. If you drag and drop an item onto another item that can contain it, such as an armor upgrade on an armor, the armor upgrade will be nested under the container.

### Combat
Combat in Starfinder can vary from regular, character to character combat, but it also includes vehicle chases and starship combat. To accomodate this, there is a combat type selector underneath your combat encounter when you create it, allowing you to switch combat types.

### Modifiers
Instead of the Active Effects, as introduced in FoundryVTT v0.7, Starfinder uses what is called Modifiers, which was built before FoundryVTT introduced Active Effects. The Modifiers system works similar, in that you can specify attributes to modify, along with the amount to modify it by. These amounts can be numbers, but also formula, so for example, "2", "1d6", and "@details.level.value" are all valid values. Finally, you can set a modifier type to be either "constant" or "roll formula". A constant modifier is always active as long as the modifier is enabled, a roll formula will show up on the appropriate roll made, allowing the player to choose what modifiers affect them at that point.
