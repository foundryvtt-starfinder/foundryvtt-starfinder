# v0.26.0 - V12 Compatibility
Luckily it's been less time between updates than last time! This update brings V12 compatibility to the system. None of these features are too flashy, but that's the point! Hopefully this update is as nondisruptive as possible.

# Core system improvements
- Reimplement grid measurement and templates to account for new core settings
- Update lots of function and class paths to account for new namespaces
- Migrate rolls to account for the split of synchronous roll evaluation
- Speed up starship action cache generation
- Update vision modes to account for vision changes in V12
- Adjust cook process to account for new server side migrations
- Implement a custom parser to account for stricter roll grammar
- Reimplement Token condition HUD
- Add `htmlField` and `filePathField` validation to `template.json`

- Fix some errors with dropping items to sheets
- Fix deflector shields not applying to TL


# v0.25.3
I don't have a funny intro for this update, I'm just frankly embarrassed it took so long, but regardless, this update fixes some minor but annoying bugs. Enhanced is on the way, I promise.

# Core system improvements
- New localisations and minor fixes to the German localisation.
- Include SFRPG classes and methods in the `globalThis` for the convenience of modules

# Bug fixes

# v0.25.2
This is another quick hotfix to address some issues raised by the new stricter modifier schema, as well as a few other changes picked up in the mean time.

# Bug fixes
- Fully implement modifier type "Resistance" to stop DataModel errors
- Re-implement right-click token HUD to overlay
- Fix Sonic resistance not working
- Remove redundant logic from encumbrance calculation

# Data entry
- Add effect for Get 'Em

# v0.25.1

- Fix hazards breaking the canvas
- Fix XP wrapping at high levels
- Make several modifier calculations fail more gracefully

# v0.25.0 - The other one that got away
The very cool features currently sat on the development branch are here! Hopefully they're well worth the wait.

## Timed Effects
Biohackers and Envoys rejoice, for the new Effect item type allows you to apply temporary modifiers to yourself and others with the drop of an item. These Effects are smart, and will expire after their duration has expired -- on exactly the turn you want, and can even reference the origin actor's stats. This also comes with a refactor of conditions and the status effect token HUD. Major thanks to Dosendusche for doing the majority of the heavy lifting for this.

## Roll code fixes
Dosendusche's other big contribution this update was a refactor of our roll code. The details are very technical, but this will result in far fewer modifier bugs, roll-time bugs, and miscalculations.

## Modifier improvements
Modifiers also use Foundry's `DataModel` class, which basically means they will be more reliable and resistant to incorrect data. Additionally,
you can now add damage sections (with damage types) to items with modifiers, and also modifiers to only apply to the item they are on, or the container of the item they are on.

## LevelDB Migration
The system now ships the new LevelDB databases, rather than the old NeDB databases, which has been deprecated. This allows us to utilize folders-in-compendiums, and should have no impact on existing games. We'll explore compendiums-in-folders soon.

## Combat Difficulty Calculation
The combat tracker will now show the difficulty for a given encounter based on the number of PCs, NPCs and the level/CR of both. A detailed breakdown of the difficulty and rewards, expected and actual, are also available. This is available for both regular and Starship combat.

## Activation Detail Automation
Range, area, duration, maximum uses, and actor resource minimum and maximum fields now all accept formulas, allowing them to scale based off of your character's stats. This allows for spells to scale by caster level, as well as some class features like Solarian Revelations.

## Feature Categories
Feats, or Features as they're now known, can know be designated a type, such as "Feat", "Class Feature", "Species Feature", and so on. This will allow for better organisation of sheets, making it clearer where features came from, and simply looking nicer.

## Item Macros
Dragging an item's attack, damage or activate button to the macro bar will create a smart action macro. It will display the remaining ammo or uses, and indicate whether an activation is active, inactive, or unable to be activated at all.

## Iconics
JonDemand went through and re-built all the iconics, bringing them up-to-date with the latest system automation. They've also received higher quality art from Paizo themselves, and fancy popout tokens. If only there was somewhere to get the empty token ring...

## Two Template Tweaks
A custom `@Template` enricher has been added, allowing you to place templates from items and journals. Additionally, when items with an area are printed to chat, there will no be a button to place a corresponding template.

## Core system improvements
- Add repost buttons to custom enrichers

# v0.24.1 - V11 Compatibility
This is a minor hotfix release for 0.24 to fix some issues labels on items not being localized properly.

## Bugfixes
- Perform global localization before documents are first prepared so labels can correctly be localised.

# v0.24.1 - V11 Compatibility
This is a minor hotfix release for 0.24 to fix some issues the LevelDB migration exposed.

## Bugfixes
- Ensure all embedded documents on Actors in compendiums have `_id`s, so they aren't discarded by the LevelDB migration.
- Restructure `template.json` slightly to reduce redundant data on actors.

# v0.24.0 - V11 Compatibility
The very cool features currently sat on the development branch have been pushed to the side to allow for this small but important update. This update prepares the system for use on V11.

## As usual when updating to a new major version of Foundry, back up all of your worlds!!

## Core system improvements
- Move system rules engine initialisation to the `init` hook, to account for the `setup` hook being moved.
- Restructure i18n files to account for new structure.
- Move custom `Math` function registration on `MATH_PROXY` to the `SFRPGRoll` class instead of patching `Roll` itself.
- Re-implement Starfinder measured template overrides.

# v0.23.0 - The one that got away
So for a variety of reasons, this update took us 3 months. The good news is that means there's some cool new features here, and a shed-load of compendium updates and data entry.

## Inline buttons
We've added a handful of inline buttons to perform certain system specific behaviour. The three current ones are `@Browser`, which opens a compendium browser, `@Icon`, which shows the icon of things like Envoy Improv descriptors or Solarian Revelation types, and `@Check`, which rolls a check. You can view the syntax and full details of these on the wiki.

## Simplified formulas
Damage roll dialogs and Check dialogs will now simplify any computed formulas into their final form. So ugly formulas like `lookupRange(@details.cl.value,1,7,2,10,3,13,4,15,5,17,7,19,9)d(lookupRange(@details.cl.value,3,7,4))+lookupRange(@details.cl.value,0,3,floor(@details.level.value/2))` will be simply `1d3 + 1`. This simplification is available to modules and macros to use too, via the `simplifiedFormula` getter on `RollSFRPG`.

## Level up button
A simple QoL feature that will go a long way; when you have enough XP to level up, a handy level up button will appear next to your class(es), removing the need to dig through class sheets to level yourself up

## The great augmentation audit
One of the reasons this update took so long, Iankid undertook a gruelling audit of nearly every augmentation in the system, updating them with the latest modifier technology and system features, and generally cleaning them up a great deal. If you have any augmentations, it's recommended to pull fresh version from the compendium

# v0.22.0

This update bring a slew of minor-to-moderate new features and continued data entry of Interstellar Species, plus a (hopefully) final batch of V10 fixes.

## Damage groups
Damage sections on weapons can now be assigned to groups. You can only enable one damage section from a given group. This is useful for things like damaging cantrips, which allow you to pick a damage type.

## Floating text
Applying damage to tokens will now show a floating number of the amount of damage dealt, as well as the resource (HP/SP) it affected. This is particularly useful on starships, as it shows you which arc was hit.

## Compendium module artwork
Courtesy of the PF2e system, we have implemented the ability to apply artwork to creatures in the compendium through pre-defined maps in modules, this allows things like token packs to be possible, and for individual users to build their own for personal use.

## Compendium browser improvements
Skills now have a button to quickly take you to the rules journal for that skill, and the inventory and spellbook pages now have buttons on each header to quickly open the compendium browser and show only items relevant for that header. Lastly, the compendium browsers will open and load much faster.

## Compendium sanitisation
We've changed our process of how we add data to the system compendiums, so that it now automatically cleans up the data and descriptions. What that means for users, is that compendium entries will be of generally higher quality, with less broken links, incorrect token sizes and formatting mistakes.

## Compendium Updates
* Add IS Gear, racial features, spells and creature companions
* Fix spellcasters having incorrect spells known
* Update solarian crystals to be weapons rather than hybrid items
* Fix Embrace of the Void damage formula
* As mentioned above, fixed a huge amoount of broken links, incorrect token sizes and formatting mistakes.
* Fixed Cloaking skin prices and sources
* Correctly capitalize Needler Pistol

## Core system improvements
* Clamp HP, SP and RP values between 0 and Max
* Add a new roll data attribute for a class's ability DC

## Interstellar Species Classes
Iankid has added the entirety of the Evolutionist class, as well as the entire alternate class features section. Note that all the new species feature are **not** in this update but will be coming soon!

## Vision Modes
Darkvision and Low-light vision can now be set as vision modes on tokens, and affect light on the canvas as the rules describe. Additionally, the Blinded and newly added Invisible condition will cause a token to become appropriately blind or invisible. This is only the beginning of our foray into the new V10 features, so stay tuned!

* Various CSS fixes

# v0.20.3 - Starfinder Hotfix

Just a quick hotfix to correct an issue with drone sheets. They can now be opened normally.

# v0.20.2 - Starfinder Update

This is an update to address the many bugs that were identified from the last update. It includes a lot of big changes made to the underlying data model to be more inline with
changes made in the core software. And addresses many the backwards compatability breaking changes from core that weren't caught before the last release.

## Bugfixes
* Fixed all of the drag and drop issues that were discovered after last release
    * Fixed crew drag and drop on starship sheets
    * Fixed drag and drop functionality on vehicles (yes, this was broken. I know, no one noticed ;) )
    * Fixed drag and drop functionality from the compendium browser
* Fixed the issues with measured templates
* Fixed bulk calculations so they don't display `NaN`
* Fixed wealth calculations so they don't display `NaN`
* Fixed issues where various sheets wouldn't open with error messages about exceding the maximum call stack
* Updated the description fields for the various entities to utilize new functionality provided by foundry
* Fixed item macro creation on drag and drop
* Various backend changes made to our build pipeline to deal with the new data model changes
* Updated the manifest file to utilize the new fields that Foundry VTT v10 provides
* Converted all of the compendium items to utilize the new data model
* Various css style updates to deal with changes made in the core software's styling
* Several buttons weren't working correctly because of side effects caused by the new data model used in Foundry v10
* Changed the background colors used for private, self, and blind rolls (these are still a work in progress. Expect these to change again, most likely)
* Fixed the attack bonus box on starship weapons
* Fixed some funky styling on chat cards caused by old css properties that hadn't been properly updated

This update isn't particularly glamorus. It doesn't contain huge swaths of content updates, with tons of new items or aliens, but it was a pretty grueling update
from a development standpoint. The core Foundry v10 data model updates caused some weird issues to crop up in the last release that kind of forced our hand. I was hoping to
do a lot of these updates over the course of a few releases through the course of a couple of months, not all at once in one massive update. I do apprecieate everyones patience
with this one and I do hope that the wait was worth it. This release makes the system fully v10 compatible, and provides the system with a good base that we can use for future development. We can now get back to focusing on content and feature updates (until v11, at least ;) ). Enjoy the new release!


# v0.20.1 - Starfinder Update

This update focuses on getting the system compatible with FoundryVTT v10. No new features or bugfixes, just the bare minimum code needed to get the system functional
without losing functionality.

# v0.19.1 - Starfinder Update

This update includes a quick fix for some container items in the compendiums cuasing a migration on every world start.

## Bugfix
- Removed some unused properties from several contianer items that were causing a migration to run on every world start. This is only a partial fix by updating the compenidum items. A later update should prevent the bogus migration from happening in the future.

# v0.19.0 - Starfinder Update

This update includes a lot of quality of life improvements and some additions and updates to the compendiums.

## Concerning Backwards Compatibility with Foundry VTT v0.8.x
**WARNING** This update breaks backwards compatibility with the v0.8.x branch of Foundry. We held off on this breaking change as long as we could, but with Foundry v10 on the horizon, it was time to pull the plug.

## New Features
### WebP conversion
We have converted all of the embedded system art files from png to webp, taking the package from 80MB down by 75%! to about 20MB, this should be welcome news to anyone hosting Starfinder on a host that has limited storage space.

We also perform a world migration to convert all item and actor art that uses these files to their webp variants. This is a very slow process as it has to go through all actors and their items, all items, all scenes and their tokens, all world compendia, all macros, the chat messages, etc. This takes a lot of time.

Do not perform this update 5 minutes before your game goes live! Otherwise, you will have a 30 minute "just chatting" game night.

### Galactic Magic Scaling Cantrips
You can now enable the Scaling Cantrip variant rule from Galactic Magic in the system settings, doing so will automatically change all affected spells on PCs and NPCs to use a fancy formula that scales based off of your caster level. Dragging an affected spell to your character sheet will also automatically update its formula. This also works for NPC's and uses their CR as their caster level.

### Spellcasting Ability Selector
Good news Precogs, Key Abilty Score and Spellcasting Ability Score have been seperated for all your Dex/Int needs. This will make your spell DCs and bonus spells calculate correctly without having to update each spell individually. All spellcasting classes in the compendium have been updated to reflect this change. This change also generally improves spell DC calculation logic.

### Gunnery Skill for NPC Starships
You can now add Gunnery as a skill to NPC starships, simplifying setting up NPC gunners. Firing a starship weapon on an NPC starship will use the gunner's Gunnery Modifier, rather than the old hacky method of using their Piloting Ranks. Note that a migration will be performed on all NPC starships in your item directory that will move the gunner's piloting ranks to their gunnery modifier (Yes, two migrations in one update 😛). Lastly, all NPC starships in the compendium have been updated to use the new Gunnery skill.

### Skill Notes
We've added a notes field for skills that can be used to denote special abilities or additional checks needed when rolling a skill. You can also use the inline roll syntax in this field so you can roll any additional checks with the click of a button. You can access this field by right clicking on a skill in the skill list.

### Compendium
* A few missing class features and items from the Armory have been added.
* Hazards have been added as their own compendium!

# v0.18.2 - Precog Pioneers

This is a hotfix to re enable backwards compatability to v0.8.9.

_**NOTE:** This will be the last version that will support any Foundry VTT version less than v9._

# v0.18.1 - Precog Pioneers

This is a bugfix update to address some issues introduced with v0.18.

## Bugfixes and small improvements

# v0.18.0 - Precog Pioneers

This behemoth of an update is super packed with lots of stuff, take your time to read through the changelist! Thanks to the combined efforts of the #starfinder community we have a ton of cool new features, like the damage system integration, and so much compendium work. And as a cherry on top, the Precog class is now available in the compendium!

We hope you have fun with the latest and greatest!

## New Features
### Attack Roll update
It is now possible to define the action target for any item that has an action, such as weapons, feats, etc. This will then be listed in the chat as "17 against KAC", for example, when making an attack with that item. Currently supported targets are nothing, KAC, KAC +8, EAC, and Other.

The action target will have to be manually updated on any items already on characters, as it is impossible for us to detect changes based on fusions, homebrew, spell effects, and other reasons for the damage types to be different. All weapons in the equipment compendium come with some target preconfigured.

### Damage System updates
Starfinder v0.13 introduced a major damage system overhaul. A small amount of functionality was still pending, and have now been wrapped up. These changes now add the damage type to the damage roll's text, making it easier than ever to see which damage types your damage applies. Additionally, items can now support multiple damage sections, so you can either pick one, or multiple. This is particularly handy for spells like Call Cosmos which causes separate cold and fire damage rolls, or items with fusions that change a damage type to your choice. Now, the UI will allow you to check which damage type you want to roll.

Finally, applying damage with damage types will now try to properly address vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities. Please take care that this does not cover all edge cases of the damage, but the vast majority of damage rolls should function properly. Please be aware this does not work for the old style NPCs either. You will have to upgrade your NPCs to the new style to make it work. Future work is expected with regards to how edge cases can be tackled, feel free to give feedback on the Discord channel.

A new setting has been made available to do the rounding of split odd damage in the advantage of the attacker or the defender. For example, if you take 9 acid and piercing damage, you would take 4.5 acid and 4.5 piercing damage, with one rounded up and one rounded down. Now, if you had 5 acid resistance, the rounding of the split damage could mean that if acid is rounded up to 5, and piercing to 4 (advantage defender), you would take 4 damage, while if it was the other way around (advantage attacker), it would round acid to 4 and piercing to 5, and you would take 5 damage. The default setting is advantage attacker, but this can be changed in the settings screen.

### Alien Archive Browser
To make finding aliens a little easier, we've integrated the work started by rrenna and took it from there to finally provide you with an in-engine alien archive browser. You can filter by CR, HP, Size, Type, and, of course, name.

* The token configuration of Starships and Vehicles that contained a crew can now be opened again.
* The token configuration for a player character can now be opened again after opening a class item sheet for a character containing at least 1 caster class. Fixes #538

* Added Dynamic Hacking rules to the rules compendium. (Thanks Iankid!)
* Added Society starships to the starship compendium.
* Added some alternate class features, feats, and spells from Tech Revolution, Galaxy Exploration Manual, Alien Archive 3, and a few AP's. (Thanks LebombJames!)

* The new NPC style sheet will now display all movement types at once, rather than use the main movement type style.
* Vanguard aspects have been updated to include the appropriate skill point modifiers.
* Various changes to the rules and UCR compendium entries.
* Various minor compendium entry mistakes have been corrected.

# v0.16.1 - Starfinder

These are some small bugfixes and improvements that have been uncovered recently.

## Bugfixes and small improvements
* Fixed an issue where old style NPC sheets would no longer open if an actor resource's calculation stage was set to late.
* Fixed an issue where spells without an action type could not be cast.
* Migrated all of the alien archive aliens to the new NPC type, removing the need of manual conversion.
* Removed the condition warning from the new NPC sheet, and updated the text on the old style NPC sheet.

# v0.16.0 - Starfinder

This update brings, amongst other things, some much needed GM lovin', with a new NPC type that supports conditions and modifiers, and roll notes so you can add reminders to that annoying DR circumventing NPC attack.

## NPC Conditions
A new NPC actor is introduced which properly supports modifiers for NPCs. You can easily convert your existing NPCs into the new format by opening the NPC sheet, scrolling down, and clicking the "Duplicate as new style NPC" button. This will generate a new NPC actor sheet, so you can check for yourself if everything is still correct. Once you are happy, you can make a pass on your scenes and replace the tokens derived from, or linked to it. And finally, remove the old style NPC actor sheet altogether.

Please keep in mind that if you delete the old NPC sheet any tokens of it you have on various maps will be invalidated. Make sure to update your tokens before deleting the sheet!

The old style NPCs will remain in existence, this way we can guarantee we do not break your worlds.

## Late Actor Resources
A much requested feature improvement for Actor Resources has been implemented. It is now possible to perform the modifier calculations for certain actor resources at the end of all the calculations, so that your actor resource can be modified by computed values such as strength modifier, etc.

## Additional Math functions available in rolls
Because data entry is a pain, we added two new math functions available to rolls, lookup and lookupRange. These are a little tricky to understand, but once you get them, they are quite powerful for writing lookup tables in rolls that do not require a mathematics degree to figure out. 'lookup' is great for sets with a lot of unique values, 'lookupRange' is for bigger data sets that do not have a lot of unique values.

'lookup' takes a key and a series of key:value pair arguments, and will return a value for a matching key, if it finds it. If none is found, it will return 0.
Example:
lookup(@details.level.value, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 3, 9, 3, 10, 4, 11, 4, 12, 4, 13, 5, 14, 5, 15, 5, 16, 6, 17, 6, 18, 6, 19, 7, 20, 7)

'lookupRange' takes a key, a lowest value, and a series of key:value pair arguments which must be provided in a sorted order, and will return the value within the range.
Example:
lookupRange(@details.level.value, 1, 4, 2, 7, 3, 10, 4, 13, 5, 16, 6, 19, 7)

This can help with data entry, especially when dealing with level tables.

## FoundryVTT v9 Compatibility
This version has been marked as being compatible with FoundryVTT v9. We've tested this version in v9 and haven't noticed any major issues. Those of you still on FoundryVTT v0.8.x can still update to this version as well. Our system wasn't affected by the big changes in Foundry for version 9, and the few minor issues that cropped up were easy to fix. And, they didn't break backwards compatibility. For now, Starfinder will be backwards compatible with the v0.8.x branch of Foundry, but there are a few pieces of deprecated code that we'll need to address once we get closer to Foundry v10.

## Bugfixes and small improvements
* Added a lot of Tech Revolution items to the items compendium. Thanks Iankid!
* Added a tooltip to Pack Size in item details, explaining what it does.
* Added a tooltip to NPC CR value.
* Added ability DC and spell save DC fields to NPC sheets, and connected them to the spells and feats.
* Added roll and damage notes to item actions. This is helpful for reminders on your attacks or damage rolls, for example, in case a specific damage type ignores DR, etc.
* Augmentations now have to be equipped specifically before the modifiers apply. This way you can now carry augmentations in your inventory without them automatically functioning.
* Fixed a minor issue with css styling in preparation of Foundry v9.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from casting spells from a character sheet without any spellslots.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from dragging a container into another container.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from dragging ammunition items into the starship inventory.
* Fixed an issue where dragging items didn't always correctly check whether or not the target container was full, allowing you to circumvent container limits by accident.
* Fixed inconsistencies in the spell save DC calculation when casting at different levels with consume slot enabled and disabled.
* Updated all Alien Archive compendium entries for aliens starting with the letters D, E, and F, completing the work on bringing in the complete collection of the Alien Archive aliens! Thanks ThroughlyDruxy!
* Updated class specific Weapon Specialization feats to have modifiers. Thanks Iankid!
* Updated Mind Thrust compendium entry to use proper spell level scaling in the formula, enabled variable spell, and updated the description.

# v0.15.0 - Starfinder

With this update we introduce a few nice features to the Starfinder system.

## Token HUD improvements

The small array of little images you'd get right-clicking a token and checking the status effects was always difficult to navigate. So now we've extended them with names, and added a convenient "Remove all" button. These also link to the proper condition items and will activate or remove the appropriate condition modifiers.

Please be aware that modifiers are still mostly unimplemented for NPCs.

Thanks to CptTwinkie for building this.

## Spell Save DC modifier

It is now possible to create modifiers for spell save DC, useful for feats like Spell Focus, or various diseases.

## Bugfixes and small improvements
* Added a setting to containers to ignore the value of contained items during the character wealth calculation.
* Added buttressing and thruster weapon special properties to the list of weapon properties.
* Added charge usage setting of 10 minutes, for some Tech Revolution items.
* Added container support to the following items: augmentations, fusions, hybrid items, magic items, technological items, armor upgrades.
* Added gadgeteer and utility belt to the class features compendium. Thanks sturteva!
* Added nanites as an ammunition type.
* Converted the global attack roll modifiers field into a configuration array so modules can make custom global attack roll modifiers. Thanks Sputt!
* Disabling actor resources no longer breaks the actor sheet.
* Fixed an issue where rolls would not work if there were situational bonuses available, but none were selected.
* Fixed a broken prone link on the goblin race. Thanks sturteva!
* Removed attack and damage features from confused condition. We're still confused about how that happened.
* Removing critical damage formulas from weapons no longer deletes their normal damage instead.
* Updated Spell Focus feat to include spell save DC modifier.
* Spells now adjust their item level also for damage calculations. Please note that this will only count for spell chat cards that aren't already in the chat.

# v0.14.3 - Starfinder

A small update to mostly correct issues with NPC's having temporary HP pre set in the compendiums, which caused issues with token attribute bars to appear incorrect.

## Bugfixes
* Fixed an error caused by the starship sensor's modifier being empty.
* Updated NPC's in the compendium to remove any temporary hit points they might have had. This caused an issue where a tokens attribute bar would make it seem that there health wasn't full even though they were at full health.
* Fixed `Actor#getResourceBaseValue()` not returning the correct value.

# v0.14.2 - Starfinder

A small bugfix patch to address any issues caused by v0.14.1

## Bugfixes
* Fixed player character spells set to Always Available or Innate Spellcasting.
* Fixed Innate Spellcasting and Always Available headers on spellbook to no longer take two rows.

# v0.14.1 - Starfinder

Hello World to Starfinder v0.14, where we introduce the latest improvements to the system. This update is primarily great for spellcasters and people making macros and custom things, but there are little things for everyone else as well.

## Actor Resources
The latest extension to our modifier system is the ability to give characters 'Actor Resources'. These Actor Resources are all-purpose numeric fields that you can use for macros and other automation purposes. An example is provided as 'Stellar Mode (Su)' in the 'Class Features' compendium, that lets you affect your character based on how attuned they are. Actor Resources are available for every actor, PCs, NPCs, Drones, Starships, and Vehicles.

You can use actor resources in modifiers and rolls like any actor value. Mouse over the Actor Resource for a tooltip showcasing the fields you can use in your formula.

Actor resources can also be listed in the combat tracker, and you can provide conditional texts and images for specific values. Finally, they can be set up to only display on the combat tracker for the actor's owner and the GM, or for everyone.

### Special note for Solarian and Vanguard players
In addition to creating Actor Resources, we have removed the old system for tracking stellar mode attunement and replaced it with the new system. If you want to have a combat tracker element tracking your Stellar Mode, remove your old Stellar Mode feat, and drag the new Stellar Mode feat from the compendium. For Vanguards, you want to pull out Entropic Pool again.

## Spellcaster updates
One of the long time coming updates is to the spellcasting implementation. The old spell casting implementation was a very minorly adapted 5e system implementation, but Starfinder has different rules. These new rules have been reflected in the system now. Spellcasting classes now provide separate spells known, spells per day, and bonus spells per day calculations, and the spellbook will inform you which classes' spellslots are available or used. The spellbook will now also show which spells require concentration.

Additionally, it is now possible to downcast spells correctly, though keep in mind that automatic damage calculation adjustments do not work at this time, the spell's level is otherwise correctly adjusted. Casting a spell with a higher level spell slot no longer adjusts the spell's level up either.

Finally, spell level descriptions now support item description filtering based on spell level. You can use the [level_#] .. [/level_#] tags in descriptions to show text up to the level the spell is cast. You can use [level_#_only] .. [/level_#_only] to show text only when cast at that level.

Future work is planned, such as a more elegant way of having spells identify which class they belong to (or multiple, if you really insist on picking the same spell for your multiclassed caster), as well as proper damage scaling support.

## Full rest changes
Full rest has also received a little update. Partially because the new spells per day setup required it, and partly because it simply hadn't been set up for proper localization yet. The full rest chat card will now provide a more complete summary of recovered character stats and items.

## Nanocyte added
With the release of Tech Revolution, a new class has been added, the Nanocyte. Thanks to the efforts of Iankid, this has now been added to the system.

## Bugfixes
* Damage rolls now display the modifier names properly. Fixes #428
* Feats with charges now send chat messages when deactivated. Fixes #446
* Renamed Apply Damage roll context menu items to be consistent with each other, and added a warning when no token is selected.
* Added a safety check around rolls to prevent character sheets from becoming inaccessible when a roll formula contains invalid terms.
* Added a safety check to prevent incorrect shield data from rendering character sheets inaccessible.
* Added a setting to only show rounds and turns during combat. Fixes #403
* Added a weapon property for the Nanocyte's Gear Array created weaponry.
* Removed modifier tab from the ammunition sheet, it wasn't implemented correctly and misleading in its existence.
* Removed max height constraint from item sheets, it is now possible to resize them vertically as much as you like.
* Fixed a small mistake with wielding bonus' calculation causing character sheets to break.
* Fixed bulk calculation for items contained by other items.
* Fixed hobgoblin speed, it was listed as able to run 3025 ft per round which is a little speedier than intended.
* Fixed missing capacity on starship weapons.
* Fixed NPC spellcasting always taking intelligence into account. (Thanks J-Dawe!)

## System Hooks
* Added a hook to alter rolls before rolling them.

# v0.13.1 - Starfinder

This is a small hotfix release that updates some missing localization keys that got missed in the last update.

# v0.13.0 - Starfinder

Hello everyone, here is the latest Starfinder system release. Coming to you with an overhauled damage type tracking system, updated chat cards to go along with it, and some small bugfixes, this update shouldn't cause too much problems with your game. Though, as always, make a backup before hitting that update button!

## New Features
### Damage Type Overhaul
The original damage type system relied on a hardcoded set of damage type combinations, now you can combine however you want. Perfect for that homebrewed Fire and Cold damage weapon!

**NOTE:** The damage type overhaul does introduce some breaking changes. The system should migrate all of your actors, items, and items on your actors. Be aware that this migration can take some time, depending on the number of things that need to be migrated in your world. Please be patient, but if you do have problems, please don't hesitate to jump into discord and ask for help.

### NPC Sheet Changes
The NPC sheet received some minor changes. Subtype is now listed in the header instead of aura, and aura has moved to the traits list. The default values for reach and space have now been set to 5 feet, as the majority of NPCs use these values. You can still change them, of course.

### New aliens
All aliens whose names start with G have been added to the alien archive compendium.

## Bugfixes
* NPCs no longer list weapons inside a container in their features tab.
* Fixed entering formulas into a skill's misc modifier breaking the actor sheet.
* Fixed the Apply Damage context menu not showing.

## System Hooks
* Added hook for actor resting.

# v0.12.0 - Starfinder

Here we are with the latest update to the Starfinder system. We have it packed with features and bugfixes. This is the first in a small series of updates that will close out our development cycle for FoundryVTT v0.8.x compatibility. After the next couple of releases, our attention will go towards ensuring we are FoundryVTT v0.9.x compatible.

## New Features
## Speed Tracking
Characters, Drones, and NPCs now have more granular speed support implemented into the game. You can now specify speeds for land, flying, swimming, burrowing, climbing, and other. There is support for modifiers for each of these, and the conditions have been updated to reflect it.

## Archetypes
LebombJames has filled up a compendium of Archetypes, so you no longer need to create these from scratch. Thanks LebombJames!

## Bugfixes
* Added references to various text elements inside compendium items, such as references to poison and disease rules.
* Added support for item automation, with the first implementation computing saving throw DCs.
* Added support for leveling up a character by dragging a class onto your sheet.
* Fixed an erroneous access to entity id in the crew update logic.
* Fixed capacity and usage not visible on newly created items.
* Fixed capacity test for ammunition.
* Fixed macro call to setCondition not checking the condition boxes on the character sheets.
* Fixed trick attack description.

## System Hooks
* Added hook for item reload.
* Added hook for item activation.

## Expanded Support for Module Developers
In an effort to make it easier for module developers to extend the system, I have added several things to the `game.sfrpg` namespace. Here is the list:
```js
game.sfrpg = {
        applications: {
            // Actor Sheets
            ActorSheetSFRPG,
            ActorSheetSFRPGCharacter,
            ActorSheetSFRPGDrone,
            ActorSheetSFRPGHazard,
            ActorSheetSFRPGNPC,
            ActorSheetSFRPGStarship,
            ActorSheetSFRPGVehicle,
            // Item Sheets

            ChoiceDialog,
            DroneRepairDialog,
            AddEditSkillDialog,
            InputDialog,
            ItemCollectionSheet,
            ItemDeletionDialog,
            SFRPGModifierApplication,
            ActorMovementConfig,
            NpcSkillToggleDialog,
            ShortRestDialog,
            SpellCastDialog,
            TraitSelectorSFRPG
        },
        config: SFRPG,
        dice: DiceSFRPG,
        documents: { ActorSFRPG, ItemSFRPG, CombatSFRPG },
        engine,
        entities: { ActorSFRPG, ItemSFRPG },
        generateUUID,
        migrateWorld,
        rollItemMacro,
        RPC,
        SFRPGEffectType,
        SFRPGModifier,
        SFRPGModifierType,
        SFRPGModifierTypes
};
```

If any module developers have any questions on what these are and what they are used for, please reach out to us in the `#starfinder` channel on the officail FoundryVTT discord server.

# v0.11.4 - Starfinder

This is a bug fix release that corrects a couple of major issues that were discovered by the community. The recent changes to the Foundry VTT Roll API caused some unforeseen issues that weren't obvious when we initially updated the system for Foundry v0.8.x compatibility.

## New Features
### Ammunition Tracking
Weapons now have a setting "Ammunition Type", which if set to anything other than None makes the weapon try to reload using the type of ammunition you selected. Various compendium items such as batteries, rounds, shells, etc. have been updated to have their ammunition type set so that the weapons can correctly reload this ammo.

### Additional Items
Steel_Wind has gone through all the missing equipment and created items for the compendium. Everything that was missing should now be there. Thanks Steel_Wind!

### Scrollbars on Filters
The compendium browsers had a list of filters on the side, these were sometimes outside the screen. Now you can scroll them, hurray!

## Bugfixes
* Fixes an issue that was preventing starship actions from working correctly when critical status was to display only on crits.
* Item container tokens should now be accessible to players again.
* Fixed duplicate items vanishing when removed from a container.
* Solarian attunment tracker broke during the update. It's been fixed.
* PC and NPC conditions should now toggle properly again.
* Optimized the tooltip system to hopefully not load 1,000,000 duplicates.
* Fixed the dreaded "Negative Dexterity Modifier" bug. Somewhat. Kind of. Maybe.

There is still an outstanding issue with the save DC calculations with feats and spell that hasn't been corrected yet. We had hoped to include a fix for that in this release, but the solution to the problem is not yet ready.

## System Hooks
The Starfinder system provides a couple of hooks that allow module and macro developers to react to events that happen in the game. There is documentation for the new `Hooks` that have been added to the system. See `system-hooks.md` for details.

# v0.11.3 - Starfinder

This is another in a round of updates to correct issues encountered with the latest version of foundry.

* Modifiers couldn't be deleted, this has been corrected. Fixes #400 .
* Fixed some warnings that were occurring when creating starships.
* Fixed an issue that was causing starship AC to be incorrect.
* Fixed power and BP calculations
* Fixed some issues with conditions not applying or toggling the token effects properly.
* System migrations were triggering every time a world was loaded, which caused some weird effects. This has been corrected.
* Added a "1.5x Damage" option to the chat card context menu when trying to apply damage to a selected token.
* Localized the labels for the chat card context menu.
* Fixed issues with combat's hanging on the first round.

# v0.11.2 - Starfinder

This is a hotfix release to correct some issues that were not found during beta testing.

* Fixes modifiers not working for feats, weapons, and a few other item types.
* Measured templates weren't working correctly.

## Note to Starfinder Contributors

I have updated some of the development dependencies, as well are removed a few unused ones. You'll need to run `npm install` when you pull in the current changes to the `development` branch.

# v0.11.1 - Starfinder

This release updates Starfinder to be compatible with the new stable branch for the Foundry VTT. Most of the updates are back-end changes to get the codebase working on Foundry v0.8.6, though there were a few typo corrections and one or two bug fixes.

* Updated some of the French translations.
* Updated the Burning fusion to be a level 4 item instead of level 2.
* The shaken condition was misspelled.
* Added a starship compendium to the system (Thanks to `@Steel_Wind#5114` for the work on this)

Even though this is a stable release, there is always the potential for data corruption when updating from one stable version to another, so _please_ make backups before updating! And, if you downloaded the beta version for starfinder, you'll need to manually install this version, because the manifest link will be different.

# v0.11.0 [Beta] - Starfinder

This is a beta version that updates Starfinder to be compatible with Foundry v0.8.x.

**Important**
You will have to install this update through the package browser using a manifest URL.

* **Make a backup of your data!**
* Uninstall the current version of the system. Skip this if this is a fresh install of Foundry VTT v0.8.5
* Navigate to "Game Systems" in the Foundry setup screen, then click on the "Install System" button at the bottom of the menu.
* Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildj79/foundryvtt-starfinder/v0.11.0/src/system.json` into the "Manifest URL" field at the bottom of the dialog.
* Click "Install"

There is not any new functionality beyond just updating the system to work with the newest major release of Foundry. Most things should be working, but we need fresh eyes on the system to make sure that is the case. There are a few known issues, but they shouldn't be game breaking:

1) The loot sheet's have some known issues.
2) The Equipment browser isn't working quite the way I'd expect it to in Firefox. When selecting options on the left side of the dialog, it's not creating a vertical scroll bar. I'm not 100% sure if it's a browser issue or not.
3) The system will run a migration every time a world is loaded currently. We're still investigating this issue.

We are specifically looking for bug reports on this one. Feature requests are fine, but we are really trying to make sure the system is going to work with the latest version of Foundry. Please create an issue with any bugs you find.

# v0.10.0 - Starfinder

This is mostly a content update, with a few back end feature updates that won't have any impact on users, but will be useful for developers contributing to the system.

- Updates various compendium items to fix typos, or to correct stats
- Updated the source field on most items to be more in line with our preferred method of attributing items to what book they came from
- Added weapon accessories to the compendium
- Added some aliens from the Fly Free or Die AP
- Added planets to the compendiums
- Added feats from Fly Free or Die
- Added the Starfinder Society pre-filled iconic characters to the compendiums
- Added races from the alien character cards
- Added better validation to some of our back end scripts used in validating compendium `json` files
- Added some methods to our `gulpfile.js` to enable better support for docker.
- Added Brazilian Portuguese localization
- Fixed a bug where deleting crew members broke the starship sheets
- Added some verbiage to `CONTRIBUTING.md` to make it clear that you should remove any already installed version of the system before setting up a development environment.

I'd like to thank first time contributors for there contributions! There were a few things that I would have like to include in this release, but didn't include, one of those things being a conversion of all of the included images to `webp`. This will be the final release that supports the current stable version of Foundry (v0.7.9 at the time of this release), and I didn't want to introduce any potential bugs at this time. But, with v0.8.x of Foundry hitting in the fairly near future, we'll see if we can get those things included.

# v0.9.0 - Starfinder

This is a big release for the Starfinder system, predominantly focused on adding improvements to vehicles.

## Vehicle Sheet overhaul
After the completion of the Starship Sheets, the vehicle sheet now got its turn.

First, vehicles now have systems, weapons, passengers (broken into pilot, complement & passengers) and hangar bays. Passengers function similarly to the way they work for Starships. Vehicles now also have Vehicle Systems which can be used to roll piloting checks (like Autopilot), or provide additional senses for passengers. It is also possible for vehicles to contain starship expansion bays, if they have expansion bay systems.

For combat, vehicles now list their primary skill for control (none, piloting, athletics or survival) and they now list their attack modifiers used when firing mounted weapons, or character weapons while a character is on top.

To top it all off, all vehicles from the CRB, the books, and the adventure paths, have been added to the compendium. So go forth, and have some epic vehicle chases!

# v0.8.1 - Starfinder

Welcome to the FoundryVTT Starfinder system v0.8.1! Another big update has come to the system, where we continue the Starship work that we started in the previous release, introduce the new Roll Explanation system, and many other changes.

## Main Features
### Starship Overhaul phase 2
In this release we bring you the next phase of the Starship overhaul. Now fully equipped with a fleshed out compendium and support for deflector shields, ablative armor, as well as other starship features brought by the Starship Operations Manual. It is now also easier to set up NPC crew for the GM, you no longer need to create NPC actors to fill up the crew roster, you can simply check NPC crew and fill in the skills directly. Future work on the starship sheets will include implementing support for modifiers.

### Roll Explanation
Additionally, we have implemented Roll Explanations. When you previously made a roll, you would see something like 1d20 + 5 + 6 + 2, but you would have to really search to figure out where these numbers were coming from. Now, when you expand the roll card, you will see a list of all the contributors to the roll, and if you hover your mouse over skills and abilities you will see the details of what builds up the number.

## Changelist
There are also numerous other improvements made to the system, so be sure to read the rest of the changelist for the details.

### General Improvements
- Implemented Roll Explanations to the various rolls made by the system. To view the roll explanation, simply click on the roll card and fold it open.
- Major performance improvements to the inventory management.
- Quick Roll is now prevented from triggering in situations where the user must make a selection, such as a gunnery check for a ship with multiple gunners.
- Weapon attack flavor text is now treated as a message sent by the attacking actor, including a chat bubble if this setting is enabled.
- Added a Contained Wealth label to container items if expanded in the inventory screen.
- Added a setting to toggle always displaying item quantity, even if it is 0 or 1.
- Added damage metadata to damage roll cards, so you can see whether it was a critical hit, what weapon properties apply, etc.
- Fixed a bug in the drag-and-drop handling that prevented item sorting to work properly.
- Fixed a bug that prevented damage rolls that include a d20 in the roll from working.
- Fixed a bug where a freshly dropped item was sometimes inaccessible to players until they refreshed their window.
- Fixed various scenarios where the Starfinder Custom Chat Cards did not function correctly.

### Character Improvements
- Improved support for shields, with correct AC and ACP calculations, including support for multiple shields.
- The @classes variable can now be accessed in all modifiers, not only chat rolls.
- Applying Massive Damage will now show a local notification informing you if your character dies.
- Fixed an issue where certain item types were not properly included in the wealth calculation.
- Fixed a bug where BAB could calculate incorrectly.

### NPC Improvements
- Drone features now go into the Features tab instead of the Inventory tab.

### Starship Improvements:
- Converted all of the Starship's systems into component items. They are is no longer hardcoded as a collection of drop-down boxes, instead, you configure your ship by dragging items onto the sheet, similar to creating characters and drones.
- Implemented damage rolls' "Apply Damage" context menu functionality for starships, it includes support for deflector shields, but does not yet handle vortex weapons 1d4 damage to deflector shield value, nor attacks that ignore some fraction of shields.
- Weapon headers now show when you mount a weapon that is of an unsupported size.
- Added speed and/or ammunition capacity to the following starship weapons: Tracking weapons, weapons with the Limited Fire, Mine, Transposition, Orbital, Rail, or Forcefield properties.

- Added Alien Archive 1, 2, and 3 entries K through M.
- Added Alien Archive 4 spells.
- Renamed "Infared Sensors" to "Infrared Sensors".
- Updated all spell entries in the spells compendium for correctness.

### Localization Improvements
- French localization has been updated.

# v0.7.1.4 - Starfinder

# v0.7.1.3 - Starfinder

Hotfix to pull in missing `import` statement which was causing an issue for starship actions.

# v0.7.1.2 - Starfinder

This is another hotfix release for the v0.7.x branch of Starfinder.

## Changelist:

# v0.7.1 - Starfinder

Welcome to Starfinder v0.7.1! This is a big release, with content gathered over a long period of time. There's features and fixes for everyone here, so sit down and enjoy reading through all the stuff that's new in this release!

## Main Features
### Contextual Roll system
In order to integrate all the various bonuses and effects that can affect your roll under specific conditions, we have implemented a new way of doing rolls. Now, when you attempt to make a roll that is affected by modifiers of the type Roll Formula, it will list all these modifiers so you can choose which ones apply to your roll. For example, Full Attack's -4 penalty on attack rolls, or Toughness' +4 to saving throws against heat, are now easily selected. Additionally, when you have situations in which multiple actors may be involved, such as starship rolls with their crew, the ship itself, etc. it is now possible to create rolls that reflect this information.

### Hazard Actors
GMs have been asking for a Hazard (trap) actor for a while now, and now it's here! It follows the suggested statblock settings from the CRB, play around with it and if you have any QOL requests for the Hazard actor, do let us know!

### Starship Upgrades have started
The starship sheet has been ignored for a long time, and with the introduction of the Starship Operations Manual requests for updating the starship sheet have started flowing in. This update does the first base steps at upgrading the starship sheet and start preparing it for the new systems introduced in the SOM, though it is not yet complete. Work on the starships will continue with future releases as always.

### Compendium updates
Spells and feats have been thoroughly looked at and updated where applicable. Modifiers have been set up and properties updated. Remember that you will have to manually update your spells and feats by dragging them anew from the Compendium onto your character sheets, as these are not automatically updated.

## Changelist

- Feats can now be activated/deactivated, and will drop a line in chat to this state.
- Fusions and Weapon Upgrade modifiers only work once the fusion or weapon upgrade is attached to an equipped weapon. (Note, this will apply it regardless of which weapon you are attacking with, so multi-wielding players beware!)

- Reloading weapons will now drop a line in chat.
- The 'off-kilter', 'flat-footed', and 'off-target' condition checkboxes now correctly apply the appropriate condition.
- The skill rank variable was added to the skill tooltips, i.e. @skills.per.ranks.

# v0.6.2.0 - Starfinder

This is a bugfix release for the Starfinder system. There were a few big bugs that were causing some breakage, so we've fix a few of the major ones that have been reported thus far.

- Fixed an issue where an annoying warning toast would pop up on the screen complaining about items missing a dexterity modifier.
- Fixed an issue where the attackBonus field on starship weapons wasn't being accounted for in the attack roll.
- Adjusted the new custom Combat class to allow for a "none" turn
- Fixed an issue where the ACP calculations were using the absolute value of modifiers.
- Created new chat card settings for the new combat tracker so that you can turn them on or off.
- Fixed an issue where adding the lowest or highest value was being calculated incorrectly.
- Tweaked the limited character sheet styling.
- Added code that should update a characters proficiencies from there class automatically.

# v0.6.1.0 - Starfinder

This is a hot fix release. There was an issue with class, theme, and race entries not outputting their chat cards when clicked on. This fixes that.

# v0.6.0.0 - Starfinder

This is mostly an update to bring the system into compatibility with the newest version of Foundry VTT, v0.7.5. There are a few bug fixes and new features, though:

- Added enhancements to the combat tracker. This allows for smoother starship combat! Please test this thoroughly and let us know how it's working out!
- A bunch of updates to put Starfinder back in line with the FoundryVTT API
- Fixed some issues with conditions not linking properly. There's still some known funkiness with conditions, so we'll be keeping an eye on these.
- More additions to the Alien Archive compendiums
- Added German translation
- Fix that wasn't allowing augmentations from adding in modifiers
- Localized the drop down items on the create Actor and create Item dialogs
- Added the `DiceSFRPG` class to the global `game.sfrpg` object. Module and macro developers can access this at `game.sfrpg.dice`
- Modified the `DiceSFRPG.d20Roll()` and `DiceSFRPG.damageRoll()` methods to return a `Promise` that resolves to a `Roll` object.
- The `DiceSFRPG` methods no longer require an `Event` object to be passed into them. This will make it easier for modules and macros to use these methods
- Added an Auto Fast-Forward setting to the systems configuration
- Removed the old traits from the Trait Selector. These have been replaced by the modifiers system.

**IMPORTANT** Due to breaking API changes made in the core Foundry VTT, this release breaks backwards compatibility. It *will* not function correctly on versions of Foundry less then v0.7.5. If you have sessions coming up in the next few days, it is *strongly* advised that you hold off on updating to both this version and to Foundry v0.7.5 until you have some time to do some testing. Though it appears that Starfinder is working fine with the new version, it is very possible that many modules will not. Be prepared to do some trouble shooting!

# v0.5.1.0 - Starfinder

This is a hotfix release to correct some issues with broken conditions.

# v0.5.0.0 - Starfinder

Sorry for taking so long to get this one out the door, but real life things got in the way 😄. This is another huge release, one that many have been waiting semi patiently for. Here is a quick rundown of what's included:

- Containers! Items can now be associated with other items. Useful for things like backpacks and *Null Space Chambers.* You can also use these to place things like weapon fusions on weapons and armor upgrades on armor.
- Added a "loot" type actor. This allows you to drop items on the map, and you're PC's can interact with them.
- Classes from Character Operations Manual added to the compendiums.

- Ability Score Increases are now handled with an item.

I'd like to thank everyone for there contributions for this round of updates (there wouldn't be much otherwise!).

This will most likely be the last update for the current stable branch of Foundry (v0.6.6). After this release, we will switch our focus to bringing the Starfinder system inline with the current beta (v0.7.3). Because of how module and system releases are handled in foundry, the next couple of releases won't come through the normal update channels, so be watching discord to see when the next release of Starfinder comes out. Once the v0.7.x branch of Foundry hits stable, we will do a proper release at that time. Thanks for all of the support, it is appreciated!

# v0.4.0.1 Beta - Starfinder

This is a beta snapshot of the current development branch. This release should be fairly stable, but there is a chance there are some game breaking bugs, so download and use at your own risk!

This being a beta release, it will not appear in the foundry module browser, nor will you get a message in foundry that there is an update available. If you are adventurous and wouldn't mind helping us find some bugs, you can download the update from here:

I'd like to thank @TimToxopeus for the tremendous amount of work he put into this release. I'd also like to thank @Juxtaposedwords, `@cmd`, and @decad7never for there content contributions this cycle. And, if I missed mentioning anyone, I apologize.

# v0.4.0-alpha - Starfinder

This is an out of band release that should work with Foundry v0.7.0. You'll need to manually install this one.

# v0.3.3 - Starfinder

We've been given the green light by Paizo to use the community use policy, so this release mostly returns some things I had to remove in the last update. The *system* name will remain as `sfrpg`, and if you're coming from a version prior to v0.3.2, you'll need to adjust your `world.json` file and change the `system` field to `sfrpg`. But, the public facing name will return to "Starfinder", so that's what it will show up as in the module browser in foundry. Here are other hightlights for this update:

- Changed SFRPG back Starfinder in the README
- Added legal blurb at the end of the README about how this system is using some images and names as allowed under Paizo's community use policy
- Added a ton of images that were provided by community members.
- Added images that are available from the Paizo community use packages for Starfinder
- Includes some grammatical corrections
- New custom dice roll chat cards
- Fixes for the custom Solarian counter management system
- Fields added to weapons for critical effects
- Added a Theme comendium
- Updates to the Equipment compendium
- Updates to the Spells compendium
- Added roll data to item chat messages so the inline rolls work correctly in item descriptions
- Fix for an issue that would occur if a piece of armor didn't have a maximum DEX modifier set
- Added the Starfinder ascii art back in the main js file, where it belongs
- Adds a way to track Ability damage
- Adds a way to track Ability drain
- Adds a way to track Ability penalties

I want to thank both Logmelna and Deepflame for their contributions to the system in my absence. Without them, this would be a very sad release with little to no real meaningful updates.

# v0.3.2 - SFRPG

This is a maintenance release that I'm not particularity happy about. But it must be done. Recent events surrounding copyright issues within the community have prompted the Foundry staff to take a look at all of the systems and modules to see if they are compliant. The staff reached out to us to let us know that our system might not be in full compliance with the terms of the Open Game License. This release gets us to that point, but it's going to be painful. This release is going to require that you completely uninstall the system and reinstall it from the module browser. You will also need to edit your `world.json` file in your world and replace `starfinder` with `sfrpg`. I've tried to make this release as painless as possible to upgrade too, but unfortunately the name change is kind of forcing this to be harder than it should be.

It's not all bad news, though. There are two new features and a few bugfixs that snuck there way into the release.

# v0.3.0 - SF1e

**SF1e** - v0.3.0

This is a major release milestone for the SF1e system. This update is jam packed with awesomeness!! First up, here is a list of imporvements that everyone will be interested in:

* Added custom icon images for conditions. I'm not married to these, so if someone has better images to contribute, please do.
* Added initial implementation for the new modifier system.

    This is the first of several updates for this system. It is now possible to add modifiers to Player Characters for skills, saves, AC vs Combat Maneuvers, Electric Armor Class, Kinetic Armor Class, Initiative, and Armor Check Penalty. These are toggable items that are easy to turn on or off. This also adds the ablity to toggle conditions on or off (this doesn't auto add the associated modifiers yet, but it does toggle the status icons on the actor's token). Modifier type is being considered, and modifier bonus stacking should be working correctly. Future updates will add these to all of the actor types (Starships, NPC's, and Vehicles) as well as being able to add modifiers to items and those being auto applied to actors that have those items equipped.

* Added new Modifiers tab to the Player Character sheet.
* Added tracking for Damage Reduction.
* Added tracking for Spell Resistance.
* Changed the "Damage Resistances" label to "Energy Resistances"
* Adjusted energy resistances to correctly model how it should work, buy adding a field to them where you set a numeric value that represents the amount of resistance you have to that energy type.
* Added support for Archetypes.
* Added a new tooltip system that shows modifier breakdowns for skills, abilities, saves, etc... Also shows the syntax needed to use these values in rolls.
* Removed most auto calculations from NPC actors and made skills for NPC's toggable. This means that most fields for NPC's are free from and should make it easier to input data from stat blocks. This is an initial step towards refactoring the NPC sheet so that they resemble a stat block more than a character sheet.
* Fixed a few typo's
* Fixed a bug in initiative calculations where they were being caluculated using the wrong property from the actors data.
* Added a ton of new localization strings.
* First attempt at using a migration script. Please let me know if things aren't working correctly. (Migration on affects NPC's at the moment, since they are the only entities that would really need it currently.)
* Added a Conditions compendium pack. Thanks to @Beans#0464 for the putting this together!
* Added a Rules compendium pack. Thanks to @Logmelna#6538 for putting this together!
* Added a support for the French language. Thanks to @Logmelna#6538 for putting this together!
* Added more equipment to the equipment compendium.
* Added additional weapons properties from Pact Worlds, Near Space, Armory, Character Operations Manual, and any other sources that I can't think of at the moment. This should bring weapon properties up-to-date with all published material to date.
* Bumped the compatibleCoreVersion number to 0.6.3
* Updated OGL to add additional copyright notices for better compliance with that license.
* BUGFIX: Saving throw button was staying disabled if no target was selected when attempting a save.
* Added a warning to the user if an item has no ammunition left.
* BUGFIX: Dragging a crew member to a different role on the starship sheet after reloading or restarting the application was throwing an error.

And for those that are interested in contributing:

* Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file that should give a pretty decent rundown of how you can contribute code.

I'd like to thank @Logmelna#6538, @Beans#0464, @Maximus#6001, and @Athenos#1514 for their awesome contributions for this release.

# v0.2.5 - Starfinder

This is a big update with a few bug fixes and a lot of new features and content.

* Updated OGL to conform to the license a little better.
* Added a legal section to the README
* Added community use images provided by Paizo
* More localization additions.
* Made some minor style changes.
* Added a `classes` property when you call `actor.getRollData()`. This will allow players to use `@classes.<class-name>.levels` syntax in roll formulas
* Added some code abstractions to the back end that should help with the upcoming modifiers system.
* BUGFIX: Fixed a piece of deprecated code that should have been updated a while a go but got missed.
* Refactored starship drag & drop code.
* Added multiple damage types (where there is the ability to add more than one damage type to a weapon) to the `STARFINDER.damageTypes` object
* Fixed the critical and fail dice highlighting.
* Item chat card description text can now be toggled to be open or closed.
* Added a system setting that allows a player to auto close Item chat card descriptions.
* Enhanced the class item
* Enhanced the race item
* Added a new classes compendium item with all of the core classes from the Core Rulebook
* Added a new races compendium item with all of seven of the core races, as well as all six of the Pathfinder legacy races.
* Added a new starship weapons compendium item with all of the starship weapons from the Core Rulebook.

# v0.2.4 - Starfinder

This is a hot fix release that removes several deprecated Foundry API calls that were still in the code base. This was done to make the system compatible with the v0.6.0 release of Foundry.

# v0.2.3 - Starfinder

This compatibility release for FoundryVTT v0.5.6+

* Fixes diagonal measurement.
* Updated to Tabsv2.
* Added scrollY to the sheet default options so that scroll remembers where it was on form submission.

# v0.2.2 - Starfinder

Hot fix release to fix consumable items.

# v0.2.1 - Starfinder

This update fixes a few things, adds some new features, and adds a lot of new content!

* Fix for #33 and #32. It is now possible to add weapons manually to starship actors.
* Adds feature request for #30. Adds an attack and damage button to items that can make attacks on the inventory tab. This is the initial release of the feature, so how and where it functions might change.
* Partial implementation for #22. This adds some ability to track the number of available hands that a character has, but doesn't go much further than that. I will consider implementing the rest of the request at a later date.
* Moves the starship data values to the `STARFINDER` configuration object.
* Lots of localization strings added.
* Adds weapon property tags in chat messages.
* Adds a lot of new items to the compendium
* Adds spells to the compendium (A-D)
* Adds feats to the compendium
* Adds more images for items. Thanks @overdox !

# v0.2.0 - Starfinder

This is a big release. The release adds some new stuff and changes a few other things.

* New icons for some equipment. Thanks to @overdox for contributing them.
* Adds several equipment items to the compendium. Again, thanks @overdox .
* Adds a feat pack to the compendium. Thanks to @overdox .
* Character sheets now auto calculate Base Attack Bonus.
* Character sheets now auto calculate base Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save bonus.
* Overall character level is now computed based on class levels.
* Skill list on the character sheet has been re styled. I made it wider and added the ranks field back in for each skill. This should make it easier to edit skills. The right click to edit skills function is still available.
* Localized most of the labels on the character sheet.

_Note to users. You will need to edit any classes that you have on your character. Once you do this, bab, fort, reflex, and will saves should calculate correctly. Also, doing this should set your overall character level._

# v0.1.12 - Starfinder

Quick hot fix for some misspelled localization stuff.

# v0.1.11 - Starfinder

This is a minor update to ensure comparability with FoundryVTT v0.5.5. Also fixes a styling issue that prevented the rest buttons from being able to be clicked on chrome.

# v0.1.10 - Starfinder

This is mostly a cosmetic release. I've changed out fonts to give the system a more science fictiony feel. I've also added a new background image for the sheets instead of the gradient background I was using. I've also attempted to unify the UI a bit by changing some of the overall foundry UI to use the same header and background that the Starfinder sheets are using.

# v0.1.9 - Release

This is mostly a bugfix release. I'm sorry that I haven't been doing more releases lately, but I've been caught up in other projects outside of Foundry. I'm still around and plan to start doing more releases soon. In the mean time, this fixes a bug in starfinder the prevents the system from working on the newest release of Foundry VTT. When creating new actor's, you aren't able to access the token's properties. This release fixes that. This release also adds localization for Japanese. Thanks Brother Sharp!

# v0.1.8 - Release

This is release fixes an issue where user's using screen resolutions less than 1920 x 1080px had the bottom of the character sheet cutoff, and they had no way of adjusting it. This is an imperfect solution, but a quick one that allows user's to use the sheet on lower resolutions. Future updates will see the sheets redesigned a little.

# v0.1.7 - Release

This release updates the system to be compatible with the new embedded entity api in the core Foundry VTT. This release is not compatible with versions of Foundry below v0.4.4. Any one still on v0.4.3 or lower should not update to this release.

Some notable changes:

* Overrode some core styling that was adding extra margin to `img` tags
* Added the ability to drag items for the character sheet into the new Macro hot bars

# v0.1.6 - Release

This release adds all of the basic melee, advanced melee, and small arms weapons to the compendium.

# v0.1.5 - Starfinder

This is the newest release for the Starfinder system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

This update adds auto calculation of EAC and KAC based on Equipped armor. It also adds some compendium items. The compendium will be an on going process that will take some time to implement.

# v0.1.4 - Starfinder

This adds support for v0.4.2+ of the Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

# v0.1.3 - Starfinder system

This fixes an issue with how damage was being applied when using the apply damage context menu in the chat panel. Starfinder has different rules for this than 5e because there are two damage tracks instead of one. I also updated the README.

# v0.1.1 - Initial Release of the Starfinder system
This is the first release for the Starfinder system for the awesome Foundry Virtual Tabletop. This version isn't close to being feature complete, but I wanted to get it out there so people could start using it.
