      "value": "<p>A staggering variety of board and computer games exists across the galaxy, from venerable board games to singleplayer computer games available on datapads or even comm units. Some are even revered pastimes in specific cultures. Only physical strategy games have bulk; computer games have no bulk but generally consume 1 charge per hour of play.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If two to six characters spend 1 hour playing a basic strategy game together, each can roll an Intelligence check, with the highest result determining the game&rsquo;s winner (reroll ties). The next time the strategy game&rsquo;s winner attempts to use aid another to assist any of the other players of that game session, the DC of the aid another check is reduced by 1. A single basic strategy game can provide this benefit only once per week.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>Varies</p>",
