      "value": "<h1>Scanner</h1>\n<p>Scanners are common items that allow you to extend your senses and record your experiences. Some specialized scanners can also provide other senses, such as blindsense or sense through, but these often require ongoing monitoring or impose other restrictions. Common examples include laser microphones, motion detectors, and x-ray visors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A shotgun microphone amplifies your sense of hearing within a particular direction. You gain a +2 insight bonus to hearing-based Perception checks in a 60-foot cone, but you take a &ndash;2 penalty to hearing-based Perception checks from other areas. A shotgun microphone can record up to 12 hours of sound. You don&rsquo;t need to take an action to use a shotgun microphone, but changing its direction requires a move action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>",
