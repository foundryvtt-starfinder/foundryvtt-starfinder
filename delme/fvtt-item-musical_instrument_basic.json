      "value": "<p>Musical instruments are popular throughout the galaxy and come in a dizzying array of styles, such as autohorns, electropaizo synth keyboards, monofilament guitars, and psychoactive wave plates. All but the most traditional and classical instruments use modern technology to amplify their sound, provide musical accompaniment, or connect wirelessly to other instruments in a band or orchestra.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basic musical instruments can vary widely in quality and dimensions, but all can be played to provide a +2 insight bonus to Profession (musician) checks to earn a living. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, this bonus might also apply to similar Profession skills. Basic portable instruments are generally 1 bulk in size and can be held in one hand, even if they require two hands to play.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/10 minutes</p>",
