      "value": "<p>This thin cloak is infused with conductive wiring and a polymer that changes states when charged with a specially modulated current. When you activate the cloak as a move action, its exterior becomes a frictionless gel, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against grapple combat maneuvers and to Acrobatics checks to escape from a grapple or pin. In addition, when squeezing, you do not gain the entangled condition, though you still move at half speed and can&rsquo;t run or charge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/round</p>",
