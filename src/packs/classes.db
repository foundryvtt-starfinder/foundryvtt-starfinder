The skeins of time are yours to see, and you know how to apply enough pressure to adjust their threads ever so subtly. Your ability to understand the infinite possibilities of time also shaped you into someone capable of altering the material universe through powerful spellcasting, and you can harness temporal paradoxes to foresee the future—and dictate the present—in powerful ways.</p>\n<h4>WEAPON PROFICIENCY</h4>\n<p>Basic melee weapons, small arms, and one of the following: advanced melee weapons, longarms, or sniper rifles.</p>\n<p><em>You must go in to the Details tab and add your selected weapon proficiency.</em></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.rlUBhTsjVbNGAlCL]{Spells}</h2>\n<p>You can cast spells drawn from the precog spell list (which is described in greater detail on pages 61–64). To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day can be found in Table 1–1: Precog above. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown in Table 1–2: Precog Bonus Spells (page 10)—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new precog level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1–3: Precog Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the numbers of spells you know isn’t affected by your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>You can cast any precog spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.</p>\n<p>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.YYa7DxMT5jHkWtsm]{Anchor - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have a preternatural affinity for an aspect of time itself that grants you power. Your anchor grounds your ability to interact with time and provides the foundation of all your powers. The exact nature of your specific anchor might be specific to you or be a broad element shared by other precogs. You must pick an anchor upon taking your first level of precog—once made, this choice can’t be changed. The anchors you can choose from begin on page 11.</p>\n<h3>Focal Paradox1st Level</h3>\n<p>Your anchor provides you a particular aptitude when using yourparadox ability (below).</p>\n<h3>Improved Anchor9th Level</h3>\n<p>You gain increased competence channeling your anchor into a powerful effect.</p>\n<h3>Greater Anchor15th Level</h3>\n<p>Your mastery of your anchor provides you an exceptional ability.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.BOut7Wi1oWcnsEf3]{Paradox (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your unique relationship with time allows you to dexterously manipulate its flow at key moments, allowing you to know what’s going to happen before it transpires.</p>\n<p>Each day when you regain your spell slots, you also gain a number of paradoxes equal to 1 + half your Dexterity modifier (minimum 2) and lose any unused paradoxes from the previous day. Whenever you gain these or any other paradoxes, roll 1d20 for each and record the result associated with that paradox. You can never reroll paradoxes.</p>\n<p>Many precog abilities allow you to use a paradox in place of a specific d20 roll you would make, using the paradox’s associated result instead of rolling a random result. The paradox functions in every way like a normally rolled die; a paradox of 1 functions as a natural 1, and a paradox of 20 functions as a natural 20. You can’t use a paradox for a die that has already been rolled or rerolled, and you can’t reroll a paradox. Some precog abilities simply require you to use a paradox without using its associated result. Regardless of how you use a paradox, it is lost and can’t be used again.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can use a paradox in place of your d20 roll for an ability score check or caster level check. In addition, you can use a paradox on a d20 roll associated with your anchor’s focal paradox; once per day when you do, you immediately gain a new paradox.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are trained).</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your attack rolls, Fortitude and Will saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are untrained).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.unJ8E4IikZUxT7x3]{Temporal Anomalies (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Temporal anomalies represent your ability to channel your unique relationship with time into tangible actions. You learn your first temporal anomaly at 2nd level, and an additional temporal anomaly every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a temporal anomaly last for a number of rounds equal to your precog level. If a temporal anomaly allows for a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your precog level + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn a given temporal anomaly more than once.

As a reaction when an attack is declared but before the result is known, you can use a paradox to grant an ally an insight bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. This bonus is equal to the paradox result or a maximum bonus of +2, whichever is lower. The maximum bonus increases to +3 at 7th level, +4 at 13th level, and +5 at 18th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.3XFg5oL5z91TN3yP]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.LcjwIZqFNztVxkjH]{Temporal Aggression (Su) - 4th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can view possible timelines and choose the precise moment that will inflict the most grievous injury upon your foes. When you roll damage dice, you can use a paradox in place of rolling any one damage die. If you do so, treat the result as either the value of the paradox or the maximum result of the damage die, whichever is lower. For example, you could use a paradox of 11 in place of a d10 damage die to get a value for 10 for that damage die. You can use this ability multiple times per damage roll, but only once per damage die.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use this ability to replace an adjacent ally’s damage dice.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.2SMy4mujW8seDrrq]{Paradoxical Acceleration (Su) - 10th Level}</h2>\n<p>You learn how to burn your personal reserves of energy to fuel a greater view of the timeline.

You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.JSeOqPlZUkKA1KdT]{Tech Master (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2><p>You are a master of technology.

This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.JXuSLeps7hhNuSjh]{Experimental Armor Prototype}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.9hIBsMSy3PmQzgus]{Experimental Weapon Prototype (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.SUOmtCEKSA521bnx]{Experimental Explosives (Ex)}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.lOB5gR1uyuadv0kI]{Experimental Vehicle (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.LAweg0HnF7J1Bfxx]{Experimental Apparatus (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.dT8OWzzvC3GL6qIg]{Robotic Improvements}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":false,"kas":"int","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"fast","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"slug":"mechanic","source":"CRB, p. 68","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"slow"}}

Augmentations must be cybernetic, weapons and items must be technological items (not magic or hybrid), and you can’t select equipment that’s consumed on use (such as grenades) or whose bulk exceeds your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p>When creating a nanocyte character at higher than 1st level, for simplicity, you can choose major forms by choosing one form using your nanocyte level, the next form using your nanocyte level – 1, the next using your nanocyte level – 2, and so on. Any extra forms use a nanocyte level of 1. You can choose minor forms the same way.</p>\n<p>When you use your gear array to create a handheld nanite weapon, technological item, or personal item, you can automatically grab and begin wielding it if you have the requisite number of hands free. Otherwise, the item floats in your space until the end of your turn, at which point it drops in your space.</p>\n<p>When you use your gear array to create a cybernetic augmentation, it’s automatically installed in the appropriate body slot as long as that slot is empty; otherwise, it fails to manifest. If a given augmentation has a limited number of uses or frequency, that limit applies regardless of how many times you’ve created it with your gear array. Equipment that requires a battery or ammunition to function must be loaded to function. When you create such equipment, you can have it absorb and automatically load one appropriately-sized battery or set of suitable ammunition in your possession. Any item that uses a battery with fewer than 20 charges can instead use a standard battery.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.lJRqcU90rzQ9CT3w]{Nanite Faculty - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Whether by their design or your innovation, your nanites excel at a specialized task.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.</p>\n<p>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.</p>\n<p>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.</p>\n<p>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.</p>\n<p>If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.2BjD4ocSE0BL5DcN]{Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.</p>\n<p>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.</p>\n<p>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.</p>\n<p>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.</p>\n<p>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.IPDN3VDLTrrMFE2g]{Injection Expert (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect. At 2nd level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with these weapons. At 9th level, that bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3.</p>\n<p>When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drug}, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon.

Choose your primary field of study upon taking your first level in biohacker—once made, this choice cannot be changed. A field of study grants you a unique booster and inhibitor, many of which work only on living creatures (not objects or creatures with the unliving universal creature rule) and have special properties and descriptors explained in their entries. At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.effKY7m8EX1NnZWX]{Scientific Method (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have an innate mental gift, and a special way of approaching problems that lets you surpass normal researchers and scholars.

If a theorem allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. If a theorem requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier.

You can do this one additional time per day at 9th level and at 15th level.</p>\n<p>If you are a studious biohacker, you can expend two uses of your biohack ability to combine the effect of two basic or minor biohacks (or one of each) into a single effect. This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.</p>\n<p>If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster’s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{Deafened}, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened}.

The entropy within the universe and the level of chaos within any system stand at your disposal, and you channel them into potent combat abilities. To you, the inevitable decay of the galaxy is simply a force to shape, control, and even temporarily reverse. The ability to control when and how things change defines your philosophy and power, allowing you to transform blows that should have destroyed you into ticking time bombs of destruction ready to be unleashed upon your enemies.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.1HVLxal9WXqtMiCg]{Entropic Pool (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have the supernatural ability to control matter as it changes states, allowing you to arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.6Fuz5JTbJCBPynZd]{Entropic Strike (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.</p>\n<p>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2–2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.wq8dRJYQ58VZQuZU]{First Vanguard Aspect - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.</p>\n<p>You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can’t be changed. Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53–55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.5bNbood0KKzBbKyv]{Mitigate (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can control how you are affected by damage or effects that alter damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can’t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Dysu4F8licjEb2FY]{Vanguard Discipline - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines. You learn your first vanguard discipline at 2nd level and an additional discipline every 2 levels thereafter. The list of vanguard disciplines appears on pages 55–57. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t select the same discipline more than once. If a vanguard discipline allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.avUIfY50kR6ZwAv5]{Reactive (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can take an additional reaction during a single round, though you can still take only one reaction per triggering event.

You also gain a special form of weapon specialization for your entropic strike, allowing you to add a bonus to your damage equal to your vanguard class level plus half of any other class levels you have.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Qy3l9fgoVaGLV7YD]{Entropic Attunement (Su) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>As you learn to exert finer control over your entropic strike, you can enhance it to devastating effect. The saving throw DC for any of these effects that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, choose one of the following weapon special properties: breachAR, bright, feintAR, forceAR, or penetrating. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike has the chosen special property.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, choose one of the following critical hit effects: corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. Your entropic strike gains this critical hit effect as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point. If your entropic strike has another critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can choose either the entropic attunement critical hit effect or the other critical hit effect. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property. The reach granted by this property increases by an additional 5 feet at 13th level, 16th level, and 19th level.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, just before making an attack, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to grant your next attack the blast weapon special property with a range of 20 feet. At 16th level, this range increases to 30 feet, and at 19th level, it increases to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, as a standard action you can use your entropic strike to strike the ground or clap your hands together to deal damage in a radius. Make a single melee attack roll and compare the result to the EAC of creatures and objects within 20 feet (other than yourself). You damage each creature and object with an EAC equal to or lower than the attack result. You can expend 1 EP to exclude a number of targets equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n<p>At 19th level, as long as you have 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike gains a second weapon special property, selected from those listed at 5th level. When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can apply either the severe wound critical hit effect or any one of the critical hit effects listed at 7th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.vbrTSpb6HaJwibl8]{Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed} condition, and your opponent doesn’t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you’re @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}.

You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.</p>\n<p>Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks.

Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.</p>\n<p>You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.RmwJt3BRTlTW0D06]{Enlightenment (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.</p>\n<p>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.

You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.</p>\n<p>All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.</p>\n<p>You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.</p>\n<p>For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0JZU0FVnvAJ08fVR]{Paradigm Shift - 2nd Level}</h2><p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level.

You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.L3DwUSzcydcwNmAV]{Skill Adept - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose two additional skills and add them to your list of class skills.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.7ilyZdE0yZi2F3SQ]{Solar Manifestation (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).</p>\n<p>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.</p>\n<p>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2>Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.</p>\n<p>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.</p>\n<p>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)</p>\n<p><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.UnESOXtPCmLvQ5VR]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency.

Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.</p>\n<p>Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a –5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.KkBSffcRhWf5j2Tb]{Broken Cycle}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.CkndBsEO0IMsYZ4m]{Electrical Attunement (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.uDxAS2HYHU2p2e8y]{Stellar Sage}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":7},"isCaster":false,"kas":"cha","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":true},"weapon":{"amelee":true,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"slug":"solarian","source":"CRB, p. 100","sp":{"min":1,"value":7},"spellAbility":"","spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"fast"}}

Manifesting or dismissing your adaptive strike is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat).</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose whether your adaptive strike is melee or ranged; a ranged adaptive strike has a range increment of 30 feet. Also choose one of the following damage types for your adaptive strike: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing. As normal, an adaptive strike that deals energy damage targets EAC and an adaptive strike that deals kinetic damage targets KAC. Once made, these choices can’t be changed.</p>\n<p>Your melee adaptive strike deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. Your ranged adaptive strike deals 1d6 damage. This damage increases to 1d10 at 6th level, 2d8 at 9th level, and 2d10 at 11th level. This damage then increases by 1d10 at 13th level, 15th level, 17th level, and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.KAmEDpsRMD12KGc3]{Evolution Track (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your body houses latent transformative potential that roils to life in stressful situations. This potential takes the form of a pool of Mutation Points (MP).</p>\n<h3>Gaining MP</h3>\n<p>Except where noted otherwise, you can gain Mutation Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Core Rulebook 242). During combat, you gain 1 Mutation Point at the start of your turn. Once per turn, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain 1 Mutation Point. At the end of combat, you lose all Mutation Points. Other class features (such as evolution drain on page 13) provide additional ways to gain MP.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can have a maximum of 5 MP. This maximum increases by 1 at 7th level, 14th level, and 20th level.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining MP</h3>\n<p>As you gain Mutation Points your body and mind increasingly take on a supernatural character, such as exaggerated limbs, steely skin, luminescent eyes, or predatory drives. This gives you two beneficial instincts and one drawback; each of these provides an effect based on the number of MP you have, plus the cumulative effects of all lower MP values. Your drawback and one of your instincts are based on your niche (page 12). You also gain the following universal instinct.</p>\n<p><strong>1 MP:</strong> You gain a +5-foot enhancement bonus to one speed of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>2 MP:</strong> Your adaptive strike gains a critical hit effect based on its damage type: arc (electricity), bindAR(cold), bleed (piercing or slashing), burn (fire), corrode (acid), or knockdown (bludgeoning). Critical hit effects that deal damage deal 1d6 damage; this damage increases to 1d10 at 7th level, 2d10 at 13th level, and 3d10 at 19th level.</p>\n<p><strong>3 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to speed increases to +10 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>4 MP:</strong> If you’re wearing light armor or no armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. If you’re wearing heavy or powered armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your EAC, though this can’t increase your EAC above your KAC.</p>\n<p><strong>5 MP:</strong> Once per round, when you deal damage with your adaptive strike, you can increase the damage dealt to one target by an amount equal to half your evolutionist level (minimum +1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>6 MP:</strong> You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>7 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to speed increases to +20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>8 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to your AC or EAC increases to +2.</p>\n<h3>Spending MP</h3>\n<p>Along with these standard ways you can spend Mutation Points, some evolutionist adaptations (page 13) add more.</p>\n<p><strong>1 MP:</strong> You can spend 1 MP on your turn to manifest your adaptive strike without taking an action.</p>\n<p><strong>2 MP:</strong> As a swift action, you can spend 2 MP to gain either a climb speed equal to half your land speed or a swim speed equal to half your land speed. This effect lasts 3 rounds. When you take a full action to charge, run, or withdraw, you can activate this ability without taking an action, rather than as a swift action.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Once per round, you can spend Mutation Points with no effect (which you might want to do to lose penalties, for example). If you use this ability as a move action, you can spend up to 2 MP. If you use this ability as a standard action, you can spend up to 4 MP. If you use this ability as a full action, you can spend up to 6 MP.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.8mmjZKc1CwekkufY]{Flexible Skill (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your ongoing personal metamorphosis and adaptation to new circumstances, your skill repertoire is always evolving. Choose one additional skill and add it to your list of class skills.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you choose another additional skill to add to your list of class skills, and your skill ranks per evolutionist level increase to 6 + your Intelligence modifier. This retroactively grants you 8 additional skill ranks to assign from your earlier levels and you must spend at least 1 of these skill ranks on your newly added class skill.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you choose one more additional skill to add to your list of class skills, and your skill ranks per evolutionist level increases to 8 + your Intelligence modifier. This retroactively grants you 16 additional skill ranks to assign from your earlier levels and you must spend at least 1 of these skill ranks on your newly added class skill.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.lwXufl59Cx2tFFJM]{Niche (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Each evolutionist selects a specific niche of personal transformation into some new kind of being, be it a living robot, ferocious godbeast, immortal undead, or being of magical energy. You must pick one niche upon taking your first evolutionist level, and once made this choice can’t be changed. Descriptions of the niches you can choose from appear on pages 14–15.</p>\n<p>Each niche grants you several benefits and affects several of your other class features. If a niche ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities) the DC is equal to 10 + half your evolutionist level + your key ability score modifier unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p><strong>1st Level:</strong> Your niche grants you a unique evolutionist adaptation and the listed skill as a bonus class skill. In addition, the niche affects several of your other class features: your niche provides a unique instinct and a unique drawback that affects your evolution track ability, determines which augmentations your augmented form ability affects at 2nd level, and determines one of the skills enhanced by your skill boost ability at 3rd level.</p>\n<p><strong>10th Level:</strong> Your transformation has reached an important milestone, giving you an ability you can use once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>20th Level:</strong> You have completed your transformation. Your creature type changes to one of the creature types associated with your niche. In addition, you become immune to one or more effects based on your niche, plus two additional effects of your choice from the following list: bleed, death effects, disease, fatigued (including exhausted), negative levels, nonlethal damage, paralysis, poison, sleep, or stun.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.kWQV1DCMWpJjJLjI]{Augmented Form (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your body eagerly accepts new augmentations, even creating some of the components out of your own flesh. You gain one free augmentation of the type associated with your niche, with a level equal to or lower than your level. Each time you gain a level, you can replace this augmentation using the same restrictions.</p>\n<p>In addition, you reduce the cost of augmentations associated with your niche by 10%. This applies only to augmentations whose item levels are no greater than your evolutionist level.</p>\n<p>If you receive a discount on an augmentation from another source (not counting the augmentation evolutionary focus below) you instead increase that discount by 5%.</p>\n<p>Note that regardless of your niche, species grafts (Starfinder Alien Archive 4 140) qualify for the benefits of this ability, as long as they’re of the type associated with your niche.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.qIIoypmTFypnmRer]{Evolutionist Adaption - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience you master new ways to adjust your body and abilities on the fly, known as adaptations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional adaptation. If an adaptation allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your evolutionist level + your key ability score modifier.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn an adaptation more than once. The list of adaptations appears on pages 16–17.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.fRtS52XLZb5yBTjl]{Fulcrum (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You create a unique talisman, memento, or accessory called a fulcrum, which helps you channel supernatural energies into your strikes. Your fulcrum has an item level equal to your evolutionist level and you can install weapon fusions and fusion seals onto your fulcrum as if it were a weapon of that level. While openly wearing or carrying your fulcrum, your adaptive strike gains the effects of any fusions installed on your fulcrum so long as those fusions could be applied to a weapon of that type (for example, a disruptive weapon fusion functions only if your adaptive strike deals bludgeoning damage). So long as your fulcrum has at least one fusion installed, your adaptive strike also counts as a magic weapon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.BShyeUVePGWK8Lsl]{Skill Boost (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your personal transformation gradually enhances your prowess with certain skills. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with the class skill granted by your niche. In addition, choose one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Culture, Disguise, or Stealth; you gain a +1 insight bonus to checks with that skill. When you gain an evolutionist class level, you can change which skill is augmented by this ability, choosing a different skill from that list.</p>\n<p>The insight bonus to both skills increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.jzZlTibXepwFExbl]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Evolutionist) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. You gain a special form of weapon specialization for your adaptive strike. If your adaptive strike targets EAC, you add a bonus to your damage equal to your evolutionist level plus half of any other class levels you have. If your adaptive strike targets KAC, you add a bonus to your damage equal to 1-1/2 × your evolutionist class level, plus 1 × any other class levels you have.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.FgNZaooyznukwPPT]{Evolution Drain (Su) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can leech genetic material and raw evolutionary potential from others. As a standard action, you can make a special melee attack against a significant enemy’s EAC. If you hit, the target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your evolutionist level + your key ability score modifier). If the target succeeds, you gain 1 Mutation Point. If it fails, you gain 1d3 Mutation Points and the target is sickened for an equal number of rounds.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you hit a creature with a melee adaptive strike or with a ranged adaptive strike within its first range increment, you can gain 1 MP as a reaction. After you’ve used your adaptive strike to gain a Mutation Point in this way, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.mGD4IPKZN4ruO73T]{Evolutionary Focus - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Having managed extraordinary achievements within your niche of transformation, you can afford to specialize into a secondary focus that further refines your powers. Choose one of the following focuses: augmentation, combat, or packmaster. Your focus grants you a basic power at 7th level, an advanced power at 13th level, and an ultimate power at 19th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.W8mYBjv5ZSNIdY5Z]{Accelerated Evolution - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you gain MP at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 MP instead. Whenever you spend a Resolve Point to gain a Mutation Point, you can gain 2 MP instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.qqSk8ZJ8RHjNWLRN]{Evolution Drinker (Su) - 14th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you hit a creature with your evolution drain special melee attack and the target fails its Fortitude save, you can choose to gain 1d3+1 Mutation Points instead of 1d3 MP. If you gain 4 Mutation Points in this way, the shock causes the target to be nauseated for 1 round, after which it’s sickened for 3 rounds.</p>\n<p>When you score a critical hit against a creature with your adaptive strike, you can drain Mutation Points from it as though you had performed the special melee attack. If your adaptive strike has another critical hit effect, you can choose to apply either this effect or the weapon’s critical hit effect. Once you gain MP from a critical hit in this way, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":false,"kas":"str","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"fast","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"slug":"evolutionist","source":"IS, pg. 10","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"spellAbility":"","spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"slow"}}
