This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex.

Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information on augmentations, see Chapter 7: Equipment. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.<br><br>If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.<br><br>You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your class level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once. The list of mechanic tricks appears on page 71.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EE8KOT5324qTuW2o]{Overload (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.lOqPFn93aueiBQst]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AiYxJza4CVXPRjFz]{Remote Hack (Ex) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JQiKFSMXkqLMW98N]{Expert Rig (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers.<br><br>You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.D5vkMjJh78XE6KkS]{Miracle Worker (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship’s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor’s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Damaged Ship</strong>: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship’s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9H5hz8bMW0i0wz2x]{Override (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UZMGMjpAwhGZNurI]{Coordinated Assault (Ex) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NtHGqPauPZauV7rc]{Advanced Rig (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br><br>In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vaV8mCJdunfbWwQL]{Control Net (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.clTAGasLWOe1pr4D]{Ghost in the Machine (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GLFInMDKp2fLRpsG]{Superior Rig (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.<br><br>Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JSeOqPlZUkKA1KdT]{Tech Master (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"CRB, p. 68","type":"","modifiers":[],"levels":1,"hp":{"value":6,"min":1},"sp":{"value":6,"min":1},"kas":"int","csk":{"acr":false,"ath":true,"blu":false,"com":true,"cul":false,"dip":false,"dis":false,"eng":true,"int":false,"lsc":false,"med":true,"mys":false,"per":true,"pro":true,"phs":true,"pil":true,"sen":false,"sle":false,"ste":false,"sur":false},"skillRanks":{"value":4,"min":4},"proficiencies":{"weapon":{"bmelee":true,"amelee":false,"sarms":true,"larms":false,"hweap":false,"snipe":false,"gren":true,"spec":false},"armor":{"lgt":true,"hvy":false,"pwr":false,"shl":false}},"bab":"moderate","fort":"fast","ref":"fast","will":"slow","damage":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/mechanic.png"}

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br><br>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use.

Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br><br>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills.

You can&rsquo;t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EpLSSSdLcqVQKcSM]{Evasion (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect. You gain this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and you lose the benefit when you are helpless or otherwise unable to move.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.On2ZrPJTe8FURsXY]{Operative Exploit - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn special tricks called operative exploits. You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and you learn an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. If an operative exploit allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. The list of operative exploits appears on page 95. You cannot learn the same exploit more than once unless it specially says otherwise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.cymsh0UZpmJB0cQK]{Quick Movement (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As long as you are unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, your land speed increases by 10 feet. At 9th level, your land speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 15th level, your land speed instead increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.seLibYiTN2eBls2s]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.bhSrjkuWxz2DQHXC]{Debilitating Trick (Ex) - 4th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can make the creature flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of your next turn. You might learn exploits that grant you additional options for your debilitating trick, but you can select only one option each time you hit with a trick attack.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.TpIFhqDUrNkdiEk0]{Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don&rsquo;t provide any advantage against you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YXdfeYmufD6OWP7J]{Triple Attack (Ex) - 8th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.scbcE4mjiHoNK7Wi]{Quad Attack (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to four attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.jd4qWJS9qElePrhf]{Double Debilitation (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can apply two of the effects from your debilitating trick.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.z736GBR6XdcqIaTT]{Supreme Operative (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; Whenever you attempt a skill check with your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, you can roll twice and take the higher result. Once per day as a move action, you can temporarily trade out one of your operative exploits for another operative exploit requiring the same level or lower. This trade lasts 24 hours. If the exploit you trade away is a prerequisite for any of your other abilities, you lose all abilities that require it as a prerequisite for the duration.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"CRB, p. 92","type":"","modifiers":[],"levels":1,"hp":{"value":6,"min":1},"sp":{"value":6,"min":1},"kas":"dex","csk":{"acr":true,"ath":true,"blu":true,"com":true,"cul":true,"dip":false,"dis":true,"eng":true,"int":true,"lsc":false,"med":true,"mys":false,"per":true,"pro":true,"phs":false,"pil":true,"sen":true,"sle":true,"ste":true,"sur":true},"skillRanks":{"value":8,"min":4},"proficiencies":{"weapon":{"bmelee":true,"amelee":false,"sarms":true,"larms":false,"hweap":false,"snipe":true,"gren":false,"spec":false},"armor":{"lgt":true,"hvy":false,"pwr":false,"shl":false}},"bab":"moderate","fort":"slow","ref":"fast","will":"fast","damage":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/operative.png"}
