To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Intelligence modifier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day can be found in Table 1&ndash;1: Precog above. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown in Table 1&ndash;2: Precog Bonus Spells (page 10)&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new precog level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&ndash;3: Precog Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the numbers of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Dexterity modifier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can cast any precog spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.

You can&rsquo;t use a paradox for a die that has already been rolled or rerolled, and you can&rsquo;t reroll a paradox.

The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor&rsquo;s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon&rsquo;s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Damaged Ship</strong>: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship&rsquo;s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship&rsquo;s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship&rsquo;s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9H5hz8bMW0i0wz2x]{Override (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.2XWEujYSyryB4oHm]{Dazed} for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.2XWEujYSyryB4oHm]{Dazed} and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can&rsquo;t be obviously self-destructive.

If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NtHGqPauPZauV7rc]{Advanced Rig (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig&rsquo;s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br /><br />In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship&rsquo;s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vaV8mCJdunfbWwQL]{Control Net (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.clTAGasLWOe1pr4D]{Ghost in the Machine (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>When using your override class feature to affect an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.2XWEujYSyryB4oHm]{Dazed}, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can&rsquo;t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GLFInMDKp2fLRpsG]{Superior Rig (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig&rsquo;s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.<br /><br />Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range).

This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components.

You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4&ndash;10: Technomancer. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4&ndash;11: Technomancer Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br /><br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4&ndash;12: Technomancer Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br /><br />You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br /><br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.

Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don&rsquo;t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you&rsquo;ve expended all your spell slots for that spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.sobLlAGQkmWcFBFx]{Magic Hack - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You have carefully studied the forces that define magic and can manipulate them. You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional magic hack every 3 levels thereafter. When casting a spell, you can apply no more than one magic hack that affects the attributes of a spell (such as distant spell or extended spell). If a magic hack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier. The list of magic hacks appears starting on page 120.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.X45ZYqyHHZNakUuY]{Spell Focus - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Spell Focus as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EVMp2EOpASIpIbFQ]{Techlore (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You rewire your mind to give you greater insight into the nature of magic and technology.

As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>keen senses</em>, or <em>unseen servant</em>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn&rsquo;t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can&rsquo;t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br /><br />At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <em>darkvision</em>, <em>lesser resistant armor</em>, <em>life bubble</em>, or <em>spider climb</em>.<br /><br />At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <em>arcane sight</em>, <em>flight</em> (spell level 3rd or lower), <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>tongues</em>.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ja89jy7LlkSG4Zzu]{Resolve Attunement (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic. Each time you cast a 6th-level spell, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum.

As part of casting a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exchange a number of unused spell slots for a single spell slot of a higher level; this expends the lower-level spell slots. Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn&rsquo;t count as such for resolve attunement.<br /><br />Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p5xoDQXN2ZcWuW71]{Cache Augmentation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Pf9uh67LQ85K52AF]{Cache Hacks (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Nvh2F2YOmAjRbzOz]{Hack Capacitor (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.4wAicxCXZcPLSOVY]{Immortal Tutor (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dyfYrwfiJ6YVsmxO]{Junk Technomancy}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rNUd1bXLhBSkLe5A]{Drone Technomancy}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":5},"isCaster":true,"kas":"int","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 118","sp":{"min":1,"value":5},"spellAbility":"int","spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"fast"}}

You can use this ability multiple times.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.zBDW8giNGqbolXly]{Nanite Array (EX) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your body hosts a multitude of nanites that you can direct to take one of three forms, called arrays. They can flood out of your body to form a cloud, combine to temporarily create items, or mobilize within you to amplify your physical abilities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><br />As a move action, you can direct your nanites to adopt an array. You can have only one array active at a time. Alternatively, you can use a nanite surge (above) to form or switch arrays as a swift action. The nanites maintain their array until you direct them into a different array, you fall unconscious, or you end your turn more than 10 feet from the array. If an array ends without being turned into a different array, the nanites disperse and return to your body at the beginning of your next turn and await further instructions. If you aren&rsquo;t within 60 feet of the array or the array is physically blocked from reaching you, the nanites instead break down, and you can&rsquo;t use your nanite array again until you spend 1 Resolve Point and take a full action to create a replacement array.<br /><br />Your nanites are technological in nature and can be detected by spells (such as&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">detect tech</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">), but they aren&rsquo;t otherwise subject to effects that affect technology.<br /><br /><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The three forms of nanite arrays&mdash;sheath, cloud, and gear&mdash;<br />provide the following benefits only while the specific array is active</span><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></p>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.QoCQEVNtgMhsElwQ]{Sheath Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">The nanite array reinforces your body, granting you a +1 enhancement bonus to Reflex saving throws and a +1 insight bonus to checks with two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth, selected when you form this array. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.<br /><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">When you form a sheath array, you can use a nanite surge to gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your nanocyte level; you lose any such remaining temporary Hit Points when the sheath array ends.</span></p>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.KOxmSWm5D1jHy8VU]{Cloud Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You nanites spread out into a faintly visible cloud that fills a number of contiguous 5-foot squares. The maximum number of squares you can fill this way equals 1 plus your Constitution bonus, and at least one of those squares must be adjacent to you. The cloud is stationary once formed, though you can reconfigure its space as a move action; if you do so, at least one square of the cloud must remain unchanged. When you take a guarded step, you can move 10 feet as long as you begin and end this movement adjacent to or within your cloud array.<br /><br />When you form a cloud array, you can use a nanite surge to increase the cloud&rsquo;s density. This causes the array&rsquo;s space to provide concealment, but it provides only a 10% miss chance. It doesn&rsquo;t provide enough concealment to hide, and your attacks ignore any miss chance provided by your cloud. This concealment doesn&rsquo;t stack with existing concealment.<br /><br />At 3rd level, whenever you form a cloud array, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 15%. At 7th level, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 20%. At 11th level, the cloud fills up to a number of contiguous&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"fontstyle0\">squares equal to 1 plus twice your Constitution modifier. At 15th level, when you use a nanite surge while forming the cloud array, any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 25% (though your attacks still ignore any miss chance). At 19th level, the cloud instead fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus four times your Constitution modifier.</span></p>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.LLNp1urkLncOxgsb]{Gear Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Your nanites shape themselves into a single piece of equipment, such as a weapon, tool, or cybernetic augmentation. You can direct your nanites to create a limited selection of equipment, divided into major forms and minor forms. Major forms include weapons and cybernetic augmentations; minor forms include technological items (excluding armor and weapons) and personal items. At 1st level, you know how to create two major forms and three minor forms. You learn a new minor form at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; you learn a new major form at 3rd level, 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. When you gain a nanocyte level, you can replace one of your major forms with a new major form and one of your minor forms with a new minor form.<br /><br />To select a piece of equipment as one of your gear array&rsquo;s major or minor forms, its level must be equal to or lower than your nanocyte level. Augmentations must be cybernetic, weapons and items must be technological items (not magic or hybrid), and you can&rsquo;t select equipment that&rsquo;s consumed on use (such as grenades) or whose bulk exceeds your Constitution modifier.<br /><br />When creating a nanocyte character at higher than 1st level, for simplicity, you can choose major forms by choosing one form using your nanocyte level, the next form using your nanocyte level &ndash; 1, the next using your nanocyte level &ndash; 2, and so on. Any extra forms use a nanocyte level of 1. You can choose minor forms the same way.<br /><br />When you use your gear array to create a handheld nanite weapon, technological item, or personal item, you can automatically grab and begin wielding it if you have the requisite number of hands free. Otherwise, the item floats in your space until the end of your turn, at which point it drops in your space.<br /><br />When you use your gear array to create a cybernetic augmentation, it&rsquo;s automatically installed in the appropriate body slot as long as that slot is empty; otherwise, it fails to manifest. If a given augmentation has a limited number of uses or frequency, that limit applies regardless of how many times you&rsquo;ve created it with your gear array. Equipment that requires a battery or ammunition to function must be loaded to function. When you create such equipment, you can have it absorb and automatically load one appropriately-sized battery or set of suitable ammunition in your possession. Any item that uses a battery with fewer than 20 charges can instead use a standard battery.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.lJRqcU90rzQ9CT3w]{Nanite Faculty - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Whether by their design or your innovation, your nanites excel at a specialized task.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be in your hand to function.<br /><br />Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br /><br />As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab&rsquo;s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it&rsquo;s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br /><br />You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br /><br />At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br /><br />If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2BjD4ocSE0BL5DcN]{Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br /><br />You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard&rsquo;s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br /><br />You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br /><br />A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within your custom microlab&rsquo;s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br /><br />The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks you&rsquo;re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br /><br />Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.IPDN3VDLTrrMFE2g]{Injection Expert (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.

A field of study grants you a unique booster and inhibitor, many of which work only on living creatures (not objects or creatures with the unliving universal creature rule) and have special properties and descriptors explained in their entries. At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.effKY7m8EX1NnZWX]{Scientific Method (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have an innate mental gift, and a special way of approaching problems that lets you surpass normal researchers and scholars. If your key ability score is Intelligence, you have a studious mind. If your key ability score is Wisdom, you have an instinctive mind. Your scientific method affects your spark of ingenuity class feature (see below), and may impact how some other class features function, as noted in those abilities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rpaon3jF3nCe5eP9]{Theorem (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you devise theories about the way the universe works. Some theorems you can apply to yourself, altering your physiological structure to gain specific benefits, while others require the use of your custom microlab or other equipment or add additional options for your biohacks.<br /><br />You learn your first theorem at 2nd level, and you gain an additional theorem every 2 levels thereafter. If a theorem allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. If a theorem requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn a theorem more than once. Once you learn a theorem, that choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Sg8hjAB2QYWFrT0X]{Spark Of Ingenuity (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Possible permutations and offshoots of your formulas constantly run through your mind. Once per day, you can alter one of your biohacks to work in a different way, determined by your scientific method. You can do this one additional time per day at 9th level and at 15th level.<br /><br />If you are a studious biohacker, you can expend two uses of your biohack ability to combine the effect of two basic or minor biohacks (or one of each) into a single effect. This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.<br /><br />If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster&rsquo;s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{Deafened}, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened}. Alternatively, you can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of your inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.mgtX5UHMPwvNkUUi]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Biohacker) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with. For weapons you have gained proficiency with only through the injection expert class feature, rather than the normal Weapon Specialization benefit, you instead add half your character level to damage you deal with those weapons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.kqK4E3QfsnbIqHtB]{Secondary Field Of Study (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You choose a secondary field of study, which must be different from your primary field of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 11th level, you gain the breakthrough for your secondary field of study. When discussing your eduction, your secondary field of study is often referred to as your &ldquo;minor.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.fBSG6tVqpRJ6ssTe]{Tertiary Field Of Study (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>You choose a third field of study, which must be different from your primary and secondary fields of study.

You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{Raise Dead} or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage.

If the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier), the damage is halved, and the target is instead only fatigued for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Relieve the target of debilitating conditions. Choose one set of ability scores: mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) or physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The target is healed of all ability damage to the chosen set of ability scores, and all ability drain from these ability scores is removed. Regardless of which set of scores you choose, the superserum also eliminates any ongoing @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{Confusion}, fear, and insanity effects; any mental @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} that could be removed with dispel magic; and any @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} that use the mental disease track.

The entropy within the universe and the level of chaos within any system stand at your disposal, and you channel them into potent combat abilities. To you, the inevitable decay of the galaxy is simply a force to shape, control, and even temporarily reverse. The ability to control when and how things change defines your philosophy and power, allowing you to transform blows that should have destroyed you into ticking time bombs of destruction ready to be unleashed upon your enemies.<br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.1HVLxal9WXqtMiCg]{Entropic Pool (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have the supernatural ability to control matter as it changes states, allowing you to arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.6Fuz5JTbJCBPynZd]{Entropic Strike (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike&rsquo;s item level.<br /><br />You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack&rsquo;s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon&rsquo;s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn&rsquo;t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn&rsquo;t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br /><br />At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2&ndash;2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe&rsquo;s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wq8dRJYQ58VZQuZU]{First Vanguard Aspect - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.<br /><br />You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53&ndash;55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.5bNbood0KKzBbKyv]{Mitigate (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can control how you are affected by damage or effects that alter damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can&rsquo;t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.<br /><br />Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Dysu4F8licjEb2FY]{Vanguard Discipline - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines. You learn your first vanguard discipline at 2nd level and an additional discipline every 2 levels thereafter. The list of vanguard disciplines appears on pages 55&ndash;57. Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t select the same discipline more than once. If a vanguard discipline allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.avUIfY50kR6ZwAv5]{Reactive (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can take an additional reaction during a single round, though you can still take only one reaction per triggering event. You can take a reaction before the first time you act in a combat, but not in a surprise round in which you are unable to act.<br /><br />At 9th level and again at 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day, though you can never use this ability to take more than two reactions in a round or one per triggering event.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WToqsamxdwAy9iTG]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Vanguard) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. You also gain a special form of weapon specialization for your entropic strike, allowing you to add a bonus to your damage equal to your vanguard class level plus half of any other class levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Qy3l9fgoVaGLV7YD]{Entropic Attunement (Su) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>As you learn to exert finer control over your entropic strike, you can enhance it to devastating effect. The saving throw DC for any of these effects that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.<br /><br />At 5th level, choose one of the following weapon special properties: breachAR, bright, feintAR, forceAR, or penetrating. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike has the chosen special property.<br /><br />At 7th level, choose one of the following critical hit effects: corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. Your entropic strike gains this critical hit effect as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point. If your entropic strike has another critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can choose either the entropic attunement critical hit effect or the other critical hit effect. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.<br /><br />At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property. The reach granted by this property increases by an additional 5 feet at 13th level, 16th level, and 19th level.<br /><br />At 13th level, just before making an attack, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to grant your next attack the blast weapon special property with a range of 20 feet. At 16th level, this range increases to 30 feet, and at 19th level, it increases to 60 feet.<br /><br />At 16th level, as a standard action you can use your entropic strike to strike the ground or clap your hands together to deal damage in a radius. Make a single melee attack roll and compare the result to the EAC of creatures and objects within 20 feet (other than yourself). You damage each creature and object with an EAC equal to or lower than the attack result. You can expend 1 EP to exclude a number of targets equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />At 19th level, as long as you have 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike gains a second weapon special property, selected from those listed at 5th level. When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can apply either the severe wound critical hit effect or any one of the critical hit effects listed at 7th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vbrTSpb6HaJwibl8]{Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed} condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4&ndash;4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4&ndash;5: Mystic Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br /><br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br /><br />You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br /><br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem. </span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.SdlB9viiKckPr0LZ]{Connection - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br /><br />Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don&rsquo;t fit within their ethos (for example, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with your connection&rsquo;s associated skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AFyfOC7qaEpto7f3]{Mindlink (Sp) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use <em>mindlink</em> at will as a spell-like ability, though only once per day on any given individual.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.BcVMnGfAN5rkPHSC]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Mystic) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ox6Am16XZqBXJNT9]{Telepathic Bond (Sp) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can form a telepathic link with up to six other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as <em>telepathic bond</em>, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ceEyKkx4fzE4Lp37]{Transcendence (Sp) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are close to becoming one with your connection. You can cast each of your connection spells once per day without consuming a spell slot. In addition, you learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can&rsquo;t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can&rsquo;t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br /><br />You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can&rsquo;t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.RmwJt3BRTlTW0D06]{Enlightenment (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast <em>miracle</em> as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dE8h1C8gOUyzeS0J]{Epiphanies}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ImTwJl02kUiZ5mFP]{Mystic Smith (Su)}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":true,"kas":"wis","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":6},"source":"CRB, p. 82","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"spellAbility":"wis","spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"fast"}}

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2&ndash;3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2&ndash;4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br /><br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&ndash;5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br /><br />You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br /><br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.fqh91mM5CY6tJp4J]{Infinite Worlds (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br /><br />All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br /><br />You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br /><br />For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.0JZU0FVnvAJ08fVR]{Paradigm Shift - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)<br /><br />The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dxdsm79r49ZhYz6x]{Compound Sight (Su)- 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways.

As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.<br /><br />You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.HtcqGXQZb4M1Nh69]{Unfold Existences (Su) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary.

You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn&rsquo;t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can&rsquo;t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.<br /><br />Furthermore, once per week, you can cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.gELZm5UXjjM3Bn1V]{Warp Reality} as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.zGohTRdAHLCUFeeK]{Projected (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.pWGQa9Ywp4WOPL8p]{Infinite Tech (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.s9yQSGGO40x7tEM1]{Infinity Lash (Su)}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":5},"isCaster":true,"kas":"cha","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"fast","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"COM, p. 60","sp":{"min":1,"value":5},"spellAbility":"cha","spellsKnown":{"1":{"0":4,"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"0":5,"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"0":6,"1":4,"2":4,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"0":6,"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"15":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":null},"16":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":2},"17":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"18":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":4,"6":4},"19":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"0":6,"1":6,"2":6,"3":6,"4":6,"5":5,"6":5}},"spellsPerDay":{"1":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"2":{"1":2,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"3":{"1":3,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"4":{"1":3,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"5":{"1":4,"2":2,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"6":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"7":{"1":4,"2":3,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"8":{"1":4,"2":4,"3":2,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"9":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null},"10":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"11":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":4,"4":2,"5":null,"6":null},"12":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":null,"6":null},"13":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":3,"5":2,"6":null},"14":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":2,"6":null},"15":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":null},"16":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":3,"6":2},"17":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":4,"5":4,"6":2},"18":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":4,"6":3},"19":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":4},"20":{"1":5,"2":5,"3":5,"4":5,"5":5,"6":5}},"will":"slow"}}

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br /><br />Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star&rsquo;s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces&mdash;a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br /><br />When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br /><br />At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you&rsquo;re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you&rsquo;ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br /><br />At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br /><br />When you&rsquo;re not in combat, you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there&rsquo;s any doubt about whether you&rsquo;re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don&rsquo;t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br /><br />To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.<br /><br /><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)<br /><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UnESOXtPCmLvQ5VR]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. If you selected solar weapon as your solar manifestation, it gains the benefit of Weapon Specialization as if it were an advanced melee weapon.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.N0vqDchAa7oI0mYl]{Flashing Strikes (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a &ndash;3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UVNOjH2ERlQjcGnU]{Zenith Revelation - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br /><br />Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a &ndash;6 penalty to these attacks instead of a &ndash;4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a &ndash;5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br /><br />In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.KkBSffcRhWf5j2Tb]{Broken Cycle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.CkndBsEO0IMsYZ4m]{Electrical Attunement (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.uDxAS2HYHU2p2e8y]{Stellar Sage}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":7},"isCaster":false,"kas":"cha","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":true,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 100","sp":{"min":1,"value":7},"will":"fast"}}

Your specialization grants you the @Compendium[sfrpg.feats.dkDzFtHOTXLnJivf]{Skill Focus} feat (see page 161) in your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, and you gain a free skill rank in each of those skills at each operative level (this does not allow you to exceed the maximum number of skill ranks in a single skill).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{Trick Attack (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization; see page 94) with a DC equal to 20 + your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed}. This damage increases to 1d8 at 3rd level, to 3d8 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d8 every 2 levels thereafter.

You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and you learn an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. If an operative exploit allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. The list of operative exploits appears on page 95.
