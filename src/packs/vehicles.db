Such a vehicle is treated as a tall creature of the same size category for the purpose of determining the reach of its manipulators, and each manipulator can hold up to 10 × the vehicle’s item level in bulk.

It has Hit Points equal to 3 × the item level of the vehicle and hardness equal to half the vehicle’s hardness. A manipulator that has lost at least half of its total Hit Points gains the broken condition, imposing a –2 penalty to Piloting checks to control the manipulator and to the DC of checks to escape the manipulator. Damage done to a vehicle’s manipulator doesn’t affect the vehicle’s Hit Point total.</p>\n<p>A vehicle’s pilot (or one of its complement) can control a manipulator in the following ways, though only one person can control a manipulator in a round.</p>\n<h5>Crush</h5>\n<p>As a standard action, you direct the manipulator to clamp tighter around a held creature or object (see Grab below), dealing half the vehicle’s collision damage. The creature or object can halve this damage by succeeding at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the vehicle item level).</p>\n<h5>Grab</h5>\n<p>As a standard action, you direct the manipulator to grab at a target within its reach by attempting a Piloting check (DC = 10 + the target’s KAC). On a success, the target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} by the manipulator.
