If you score a critical hit with a doshko that normally has the wound or severe wound critical hit effect, you also apply the knockdown critical hit effect to the target. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Desna</em>: </strong>Your deity sometimes grants you bursts of luck. Once per day, you can reroll any one failed skill check. </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Devourer</em>:</strong> If you are knocked unconscious or killed by a creature that is a legal target for a weapon you are wielding, as a reaction you can make a single attack against the creature. You can make this single attack despite being unconscious or dead. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Eloritu</em>: </strong>Once per day you can cast identify as a spell-like ability, attempting a caster level check (use your character level as your caster level: 1d20 + your character level), in place of the normal Engineering or Mysticism check (though you still receive identify’s +10 bonus). </p>\n<p><strong><em>Hylax</em>: </strong>You gain limited telepathy, as per the shirren racial ability.
