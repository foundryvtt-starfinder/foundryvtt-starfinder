Additionally, <em>greater dispel magic</em> has a chance to dispel any curse that <em>remove affliction</em> can remove, even if <em>dispel magic</em> can&rsquo;t dispel that effect.

Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area, as if it were targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>.

The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled.<br /><br />You choose to use&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;in one of two ways: as a targeted dispel or as a counter.<br /><br /><strong>Targeted Dispel</strong>: One creature, object, or spell is the target of the&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as&nbsp;zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as &ldquo;that burning wall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spell that&rsquo;s giving him those duplicates&rdquo;). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends. If you don&rsquo;t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.<br /><br />If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br /><br />If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect.

Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br /><br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><br /><strong>Counter</strong>: You can use the energy of&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell.

The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the target is reincarnated.<br><br>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class features, feats, and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and Hit Points are unchanged. The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level, it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.<br><br>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.<br><br>Elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. Any creature that can’t benefit from the&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.<br><br>The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including any forms of movement and speeds, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>D%</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Incarnation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1–6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">7–14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15–22</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">23–30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">31–34</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">35–38</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">39–46</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">47–55</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">56–64</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Lashunta</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">65–73</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">74–81</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">82–90</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Vesk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">91–99</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Other (GM’s choice)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>A&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish&nbsp;spell can restore a reincarnated creature to its original form.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"CRB pg. 372","type":"","activation":{"type":"min","cost":10,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"instantaneous; see text","units":""},"target":{"value":"one dead creature","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":null,"shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"touch","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":null,"per":""},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"level":4,"school":"trs","sr":true,"dismissible":false,"concentration":false,"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"allowedClasses":{"myst":true,"tech":false,"wysh":true},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/reincarnate.png","effects":[]}

You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as “that burning wall” or “the spell that’s giving him those duplicates”).

First, select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast <em>dispel magic</em> when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action.

A handy junkbot is Small, its KAC and EAC are each equal to 10 + your caster level, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to one-quarter of your own (but no Stamina Points). It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. It can accomplish all tasks described in the Computers, Engineering, Piloting, and Sleight of Hand skills, is considered trained in those skills, and has a total skill bonus in each equal to 3 + your caster level. The junkbot is treated as if it is using a hacker’s kit when using the Computers skill and an engineering kit when using the Engineering skill. A handy junkbot can never attack. The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses if it is the target of a spell or another targeted effect. For purposes of spells and effects that target the junkbot, it is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes.<br><br>You can give new basic commands to your handy junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature.

{"name":"Teleport","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination within 2,000 miles. Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet’s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br><br>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10–1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br><br><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br><br><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “mishap” comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\"><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Very familiar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Studied carefully</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">95–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Seen casually</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">89–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">95–98</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">99–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Viewed once</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–76</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">77–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">89–96</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">97–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">False destination</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">81–92</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">93–100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"CRB pg. 381","type":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"instantaneous","units":""},"target":{"value":"you and touched objects and other touched willing or unconscious creatures","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":null,"shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":2000,"units":"mi","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":null,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"will","dc":"","descriptor":"object"},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"level":5,"school":"con","sr":true,"dismissible":false,"concentration":false,"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"allowedClasses":{"myst":false,"tech":true,"wysh":true},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/teleport.PNG","effects":[],"_id":"VZpAfh3SIhWndHJl"}

The hologram can include intelligible speech, if you wish.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 5th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the size of the hologram can&rsquo;t extend beyond a 20-foot cube plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. You can choose to make the hologram permanent at the time of casting. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating. Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger. The trigger can&rsquo;t be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. The spell lasts until it is triggered, and then the hologram lasts for 1 round per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 6th-level spell, it creates a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself at medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). This hologram looks, sounds, and smells like you, but it is intangible. The hologram mimics your actions (including speech) unless you use a move action to direct it to act differently. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action.

The hologram can&rsquo;t cast spells on itself except for illusion spells. Spells cast in this manner affect other targets normally, despite originating from the hologram. An object isn&rsquo;t deceived by illusions (treat as if it had succeeded at its Will saving throw). The hologram remains for 1 round per level, and you must maintain line of effect to the hologram at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use&nbsp;dimension door,&nbsp;plane shift,&nbsp;teleport, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

Your duplicate acts just after you do each round—it doesn’t have a separate initiative count. One of you can use a full round’s worth of actions, and the other can take only a standard or a move action. Between the two of you, you can cast only one spell per round—unless you have a special ability that allows you to cast more than one spell when you have no duplicate, such as the quickened spell magic hack. You and your duplicate share sensory information, so if one of you is aware of or knows something, both of you do.

If your duplicate casts a spell, your spell is expended, and if your duplicate uses a consumable item, that item is no longer available to you. Similarly, if an item one of you carries is permanently lost or destroyed, that item is lost or destroyed for both. Attacks, spells, and effects affect the two bodies as though they were one person, taking the worst effect applicable. For example, if both bodies are in the same <em>explosive blast</em>, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If you fail the saving throw against <em>hold person</em>, both bodies are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.NV4qXRDgb7zTNkW2]{Paralyzed}, and if one body catches a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}, both do. Both bodies count as one creature for spell effects, and they can’t be chosen more than once for such effects. Any magical effect on you has its duration halved while you’re bilocating.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom or breaks free. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual’s proper name in casting the spell. The CR of the outsider you can call with&nbsp;planar binding&nbsp;depends on the spell’s level.<br><br><strong>4th: </strong>One outsider of CR 4 or lower<br><strong>5th: </strong>One outsider of CR 7 or lower<br><strong>6th: </strong>One outsider of CR 10 or lower<br><br>The target creature can attempt a Will saving throw. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it resists the spell. If it fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully using its spell resistance (meaning you fail a caster level check against its spell resistance), by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC = 15 + half your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day, and a natural 20 on this check always succeeds (and a natural 1 on your caster level check always fails). If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A&nbsp;planar barrier&nbsp;spell cast in the area prevents the creature from escaping via dimensional travel.<br><br>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to convince the creature to perform a task for you in exchange for release and perhaps some sort of reward. The creature decides which terms it is willing to accept, and it must willingly agree to the terms; magical compulsion isn’t sufficient. This continues until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. It never agrees to unreasonable commands.<br><br>Once the requested service has been completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back to its home plane.
