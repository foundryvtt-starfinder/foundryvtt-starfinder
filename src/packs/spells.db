If you are successful, you can determine the sights, sounds, and smells the brain receives, creating an illusion only the target can perceive, similar to a 4th-level holographic projection spell. The target can attempt a new saving throw when it interacts with these impressions to recognize them as false, but this doesn’t immediately end the effect. The impressions last for as long as the spell does, but you must attempt additional Computers checks to alter them in subsequent rounds.<br>5th:&nbsp;When you cast&nbsp;hack wetware&nbsp;as a 5th-level spell, it functions like the 4th-level casting of the spell, but you can also hack the target’s mind to implant a subconscious command that can be activated at a later time. If you are successful, you can state a course of activity similar to that of a suggestion spell and a trigger, such as a static image or a code phrase. This ends the hack wetware spell, but the subconscious command remains in the target’s brain for a number of days equal to your technomancer level. The next time the target perceives the trigger, it performs the suggested course of action as best it can if it fails another Will saving throw. For every 5 your Computers check exceeded the DC, the target takes a cumulative –2 penalty to this saving throw. The command can be triggered only once.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Starfinder #25: The Chimera Mystery pg. 52","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":25,"units":"ft","additional":"5","per":"2 levels"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"level":2,"school":"div","sr":false,"dismissible":false,"concentration":false,"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"allowedClasses":{"myst":false,"tech":true,"wysh":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/hack_wetware.png"}

The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10–1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br><br><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.

{"_id":"rJ0acpj21GDJYaim","name":"Summon Creature","permission":{"default":0,"EgDbkW0aYa1c3C2f":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an elemental, magical beast native to another plane, or outsider, but also occasionally even extraplanar constructs). The summoned creature appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it to not attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.<br><br>When you gain this spell as a spell known, select four creatures from the appropriate list in Table 8: Summon Creature for each level at which you can cast this spell. For example, for the 1st-level&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;spell, you could choose Tiny air, earth, fire, and water elementals. Note that a particular alignment or class is sometimes required to choose certain creatures, as listed in Table 8. In place of a single selection, you can choose a creature from a lower-level summoning list; doing so allows you the option of summoning multiple such creatures at a time. Each time you gain a character level, you can change these selections.<br><br>You can gain&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;a second time at the highest spell level you know, selecting four additional appropriate creatures at each level you can cast this spell.<br><br>You choose which of the selected creatures you summon each time you cast the spell.<br><br><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 1st-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 1st-level summoning list.<br><br><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 2nd-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 2nd-level summoning list. If the chosen creature is from a lower-level summoning list, you summon three such creatures instead.<br><br><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 3rd-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 3rd-level summoning list. If the chosen creature is from a lower-level summoning list, you summon three such creatures instead.<br><br><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 4th-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 4th-level summoning list. If the chosen creature is from a lower-level summoning list, you summon three such creatures instead.<br><br><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 5th-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 5th-level summoning list. If the chosen creature is from a lower-level summoning list, you summon three such creatures instead.<br><br><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;as a 6th-level spell, you summon one creature from your selection of creatures from the 6th-level summoning list. If the chosen creature is from a lower-level summoning list, you summon three such creatures instead.<br><br>A summoned creature can’t use teleportation or planar travel abilities or magical divination abilities. Creatures can’t be summoned into an environment that can’t support them (such as summoning a breathing creature into a vacuum). Creatures summoned using this spell can’t use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that require expending Resolve Points or expensive materials to cast (such as&nbsp;raise dead).<br><br>To generate statistics for a summoned creature, first check the Stat Block column of the below tables. If the stat block is \"Alien\", use the creature’s stat block on that link, though it is altered slightly depending on your alignment. Otherwise, if the entry is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or elder, use the elemental stat block of the same name and apply the appropriate graft, listed in the Applied Graft column. Non-elemental creatures lose elemental immunities and do not gain an elemental graft. For example, to get the statistics of an angel from the 1st-level list, you use the tiny elemental stat block and apply the angel summoning graft.<br><br></p>\n<table style=\"height: 408px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 34px;

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom or breaks free. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual’s proper name in casting the spell. The CR of the outsider you can call with&nbsp;planar binding&nbsp;depends on the spell’s level.<br><br><strong>4th: </strong>One outsider of CR 4 or lower<br><strong>5th: </strong>One outsider of CR 7 or lower<br><strong>6th: </strong>One outsider of CR 10 or lower<br><br>The target creature can attempt a Will saving throw. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it resists the spell. If it fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully using its spell resistance (meaning you fail a caster level check against its spell resistance), by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC = 15 + half your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day, and a natural 20 on this check always succeeds (and a natural 1 on your caster level check always fails). If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A&nbsp;planar barrier&nbsp;spell cast in the area prevents the creature from escaping via dimensional travel.<br><br>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to convince the creature to perform a task for you in exchange for release and perhaps some sort of reward. The creature decides which terms it is willing to accept, and it must willingly agree to the terms; magical compulsion isn’t sufficient. This continues until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. It never agrees to unreasonable commands.<br><br>Once the requested service has been completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back to its home plane. The creature might later seek revenge against you for having imprisoned it.
