You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as “that burning wall” or “the spell that’s giving him those duplicates”). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends.

A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item’s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n<p>You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Counter</strong>: You can use the energy of&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;to disrupt the casting of other spells.

This spell can’t create wind in an area that has no atmosphere.</p>\n<p><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast control winds as a 1st-level spell, you can lower or raise the wind speed in the area by one level (for example, from strong wind to either moderate or severe wind), to a minimum of no wind and a maximum of severe wind.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast control winds as a 2nd-level spell, you can lower or raise the wind speed in the area by up to two levels, to a minimum of no wind and a maximum of severe wind.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast control winds as a 3rd-level spell, you can lower or raise the wind speed in the area by up to three levels, to a minimum of no wind and a maximum of severe wind.</p>\n<p>When you dismiss the spell or it otherwise ends, you can create a blast of severe wind in an instantaneous line-shaped burst that originates from the area’s point of origin and has a length equal to the area’s radius. Creatures that enter the area or start their turn there must attempt a Fortitude saving throw to avoid effects based on their size: Tiny and smaller creatures are knocked prone and pushed 1d4 × 10 feet along the wind’s path, up to the end of the wind’s range, and the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. Small creatures are knocked prone. Medium and smaller creatures moving against the wind move at half speed. In addition, flying creatures in the area must attempt an Acrobatics check to fly in dangerous wind conditions. This gust can also do whatever a gust of severe wind might be expected to do, such as put out small flames, fan large flames, blow away vapors, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast control winds as a 4th-level spell, it functions as the 3rd-level version, but you can raise the wind speed up to a maximum of windstorm. In addition, when you cast the spell, you can exclude up to 2 squares per level from the spell’s effects; these squares must be contiguous.</p>\n<p>If you create a blast of wind when you dismiss the spell or it otherwise ends, the blast is windstorm level. Creatures are treated as one size category smaller when determining the effects of the blast on them.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"dismissible":false,"duration":{"units":"","value":"10 minutes/level (D)"},"formula":"","isActive":null,"isVariableLevel":true,"level":1,"materials":{"consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0,"value":""},"modifiers":[],"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"range":{"additional":"","per":"level","units":"ft","value":10},"rollNotes":"","save":{"type":"fort","dc":"","descriptor":"negate"},"school":"trs","source":"GEM pg. 114","sr":true,"target":{"type":"","value":""},"uses":{"max":null,"per":"","value":null}}}

Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p>\n<p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).</p>\n<p>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “mishap” comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\"><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Very familiar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Studied carefully</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">95–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Seen casually</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">89–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">95–98</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">99–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Viewed once</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–76</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">77–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">89–96</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">97–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">False destination</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">81–92</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">93–100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"descriptors":[],"dismissible":false,"duration":{"units":"","value":"instantaneous"},"formula":"","isActive":null,"isVariableLevel":false,"level":5,"materials":{"consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0,"value":""},"modifiers":[],"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"mi","value":2000},"rollNotes":"","save":{"type":"will","dc":"","descriptor":"object"},"school":"con","source":"CRB pg. 381","sr":true,"target":{"type":"","value":"you and touched objects and other touched willing or unconscious creatures"},"uses":{"max":null,"per":"","value":null}}}

A battle junkbot is Small, its KAC and EAC are each equal to 15 + your technomancer level, it has hardness 15, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to half of your own (but no Stamina Points). It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects. It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. For purposes of spells and effects that target the junkbot, it is treated as a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.</p>\n<p>The battle junkbot has four hands. It is treated as if it had the Deadly Aim and Improved Combat Maneuver (Bull Rush, Grapple, Trip) feats. It has an attack bonus equal to 6 + your technomancer level; in one hand it wields a special buzzblade dagger that deals 6d8+6 damage instead of its normal damage, and a second hand carries a special light laser pistol that deals 6d6 damage instead of its normal damage. Damage from the junkbot’s special weapons counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p>You can give new basic commands to your battle junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the robot has made an attack or combat maneuver and whether or not it was successful, as well as when the battle junkbot has been attacked, has taken damage, or is destroyed, but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link.</p>\n<p>When the battle junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends, the electronic equipment you used to create the junkbot falls apart into refuse, its circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable. You cannot use this refuse as a target to create another junkbot.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"dismissible":false,"duration":{"units":"","value":"1 round/level"},"formula":"","level":6,"materials":{"consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0,"value":""},"modifiers":[],"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"touch","value":null},"save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":"negate"},"school":"trs","source":"CRB pg. 341","sr":false,"target":{"type":"","value":"at least 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text"},"uses":{"max":null,"per":"","value":null}}}

One of you can use a full round’s worth of actions, and the other can take only a standard or a move action. Between the two of you, you can cast only one spell per round—unless you have a special ability that allows you to cast more than one spell when you have no duplicate, such as the quickened spell magic hack. You and your duplicate share sensory information, so if one of you is aware of or knows something, both of you do. The duplicate is another creature for most purposes, with the following exceptions.</p>\n<p>You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share resources, including one pool of consumable items (including ammo), daily-use abilities (including from items) and spell slots, Hit Points, Resolve Points, and Stamina Points. If your duplicate casts a spell, your spell is expended, and if your duplicate uses a consumable item, that item is no longer available to you. Similarly, if an item one of you carries is permanently lost or destroyed, that item is lost or destroyed for both. Attacks, spells, and effects affect the two bodies as though they were one person, taking the worst effect applicable. For example, if both bodies are in the same @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.WP0QPu6QvApGaQIG]{Explosive Blast}, you attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once.

It can try each method once per day, and a natural 20 on this check always succeeds (and a natural 1 on your caster level check always fails). If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you.

To have any effect, you must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you successfully dampen a spell, the caster can cease casting, losing the action used for casting rather than the spell slot. This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.</p>\n<p><strong>1st</strong>: If you cast dampen spell using a 1st-level slot, choose one of the following effects.</p>\n<p><em>Contract</em>: Halve the spell’s range. If the targeted spell can no longer reach its target, the caster can choose a new target within the new range and continue casting.</p>\n<p><em>Exclude</em>: An area or multitarget spell excludes one target of your choice.</p>\n<p><em>Mistarget</em>: Make the spell go off-target as if it’s a thrown weapon that missed its grid intersection (Core Rulebook 245).</p>\n<p><em>Shorten</em>: If the spell’s duration is measured in rounds or minutes, halve that duration (round down, minimum 0 or 5 rounds for 1 minute rounded down). You can’t shorten a spell that has a duration measured in longer increments.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd</strong>: If you cast dampen spell using a 2nd-level slot, choose one of the following effects.</p>\n<p>Reduce: Halve the area or number of targets the spell can affect.</p>\n<p><em>Shorten</em>: If the spell’s duration is measured in hours, halve that duration (round down, minimum 30 minutes for 1 hour rounded down).
