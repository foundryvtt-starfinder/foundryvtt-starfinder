For each of these skills that is already a class skill for you (or becomes a class skill) from a source other than this archetype, you learn to speak and read a new language. In addition, you can use Diplomacy in place of Intimidate for checks to demoralize and Culture for Life Science checks to identify humanoids and monstrous humanoids. When you fail a Diplomacy check to change a creature’s attitude, the creature’s attitude worsens only if you fail the check by 10 or more.</p>\n<h2>Military Training (Ex) - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain one of the following feats as a bonus feat, provided you meet all the prerequisites of the chosen feat: Advanced Melee Weapon Proficiency, Improved Unarmed Strike, or Longarm Proficiency. If you already have all the listed feats, you can choose a bonus combat feat instead. At 6th level, if you chose Improved Unarmed Strike at 4th level, you gain Improved Combat Maneuver.

Numerous orders, including (but certainly not limited to) the Knights of Golarion and the Hellknight Orders of the Chain, Eclipse, Furnace, Gate, Nail, Pike, and Scourge, are extremely active in the Pact Worlds and beyond. These highly trained and renowned warriors are star knights, defenders of specific causes championed by their orders and ready to enforce their oaths with sword, plasma cannon, and even magic when necessary.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The star knight archetype grants alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th levels. The star knight is an unusual archetype in that the 6th- and 12th-level alternate class features have multiple options, depending on what knightly order you belong to. If you don’t belong to a specific order (or you belong to one not listed here), you receive the guarded attack and the willpower alternate class features; if you to belong to one of the listed orders, you can still select these features if you wish.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>You gain proficiency with light armor. If you are already proficient with light armor, you instead gain proficiency with heavy armor. If you are already proficient with heavy armor, you instead gain a fortification ability when wearing heavy armor or powered armor. Your fortification gives you a 20% chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit’s damage is rolled. If you have a fortification ability from another source (such as a force field), you instead increase the chance of a critical hit being created as a normal attack by 20% (to a maximum of 100%).</p>\n<h2>Challenge - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>As a champion of a knightly order, you can focus your fury and attention on a single foe, forcing it to face your wrath. As a full action, you can move up to your speed and make a single attack against a foe able to see and hear you. If you have the trick attack class feature and the weapon you use qualifies for a trick attack, you can make this attack as a trick attack. Whether or not you move or make an attack, you can attempt to demoralize that foe, as per the Intimidate skill task. If your base attack bonus is greater than your total Intimidate skill bonus, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your total Intimidate bonus for this skill check. If you succeed at this check, for the duration of the shaken effect, the target is also off-target for any attack it makes that does not include you as a target. Once you use this ability against a foe, regardless of the result of your demoralize attempt, you can’t use it on that target again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Guarded Attack (Ex) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>You have learned to use the strong plates and defensive abilities of your heavy armor to protect your weapon. When wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you gain a +4 bonus to your KAC against disarm and sunder combat maneuvers. You lose this bonus whenever you make a full attack, as it is impossible to protect your weapons while doing so.</p>\n<h2>Willpower (Ex) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>Your dedication to your order and your advanced training has strengthened your mind against certain effects. Once per day, when targeted by a mind-affecting effect that requires a saving throw, you can roll twice and take the better result.</p>\n<h2>Order-Specific Alternate 6th-Level Class Features</h2>\n<p>Members of the Knights of Golarion and of the most common Hellknight orders each have one order-specific option that they can select for the alternate class feature at 6th level. Once you decide which 6th-level alternate class feature to take, you cannot change this decision.</p>\n<h3>Anchoring Attack (Su) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Chain can choose the anchoring attack alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can apply the anchoring weapon fusion to any weapon you wield. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter. The weapon fusion remains active until the weapon becomes unattended or is wielded by another creature, or until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. This weapon fusion does not count toward the maximum number of levels of weapons fusions a weapon can have at once.</p>\n<h3>Blazing Attack (Su) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Furnace can choose the blazing attack alternate class feature. This acts as the anchoring attack alternate class feature, but it grants the flaming weapon fusion as a standard action to a single weapon of 2nd level or higher that the knight wields.</p>\n<h3>Command (Sp) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Nail can choose the command alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can cast command as a spell-like ability. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter. The save DC is equal to 11 + your key ability score modifier.</p>\n<h3>Create Darkness (Su) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Eclipse can choose the create darkness alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can create a 20-foot-radius zone of darkness centered within 20 feet of you. The zone negates the effects of all nonmagical light sources in its area and lasts for 1 minute. You can see as normal within the zone, and you can dismiss the effect as a standard action. Unless otherwise noted, any magic source of light can increase the light level in the area as normal. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and at 18th level.</p>\n<h3>Holy Attack (Su) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Knight of Golarion can choose the holy attack alternate class feature. This acts as the anchoring attack alternate class feature, but it grants the holy weapon fusion as a standard action to any weapon of 2nd level or higher that the knight wields.</p>\n<h3>Pike Mastery (Su) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Pike can choose the pike mastery alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can grant a melee weapon you wield the reach special property. Alternatively, you can combine a melee weapon that already has the reach special property with a ranged weapon you are proficient with, allowing the conglomeration to act both as a melee weapon with reach and as a ranged weapon. Whichever option you select, it lasts until the weapon becomes unattended, the weapon is wielded by another creature, you choose to dismiss the effect, or you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and at 18th level.</p>\n<h3>Summon (Sp) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Gate can choose the summon alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can cast summon creature as a spell-like ability with a spell level equal to one-third your class level. You can select only a single lawful creature to summon with this spell. You can use this ability once per day.</p>\n<h3>Zone of Truth (Sp) - 6th Level</h3>\n<p>A Hellknight of the Order of the Scourge can choose the zone of truth alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can cast zone of truth as a spell-like ability. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The save DC is equal to 12 + your key ability score modifier.</p>\n<h3>Order-Specific Alternate 12th-Level Class Features</h3>\n<p>Hellknights and Knights of Golarion each have a specific option which they can select for the alternate class feature at 12th level. Once the decision of which 12th-level alternate class feature to take is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<h3>In Hell’s Name (Su) - 12th Level</h3>\n<p>Hellknights of any order can choose the in Hell’s name alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can pronounce a judgment against all nonlawful creatures within 20 feet of you. Each target that can hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your key ability score modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent effect. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 18th level.</p>\n<h3>Shield Other (Sp) - 12th Level</h3>\n<p>A Knight of Golarion can choose the shield other alternate class feature. As a standard action, you can cast shield other as a spell-like ability without having to spend a Resolve Point. You can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day at 15th level and at 18th level.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"PW pg. 186"}}

Each victory cry can be learned up to two times: the first time at 2nd level or higher, and the second time at 9th level or higher. Limited victory cries affect only the ally that scored a critical hit or reduced an enemy to 0 Hit Points; these are labeled with an asterisk (*). An ally can be affected by each specific victory cry (regardless of its source) only once until they take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<h3>Got ’Em!</h3>\n<p>Each ally affected by this victory cry gains a morale bonus to damage rolls until the end of their next turn equal to half your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

If you learn this victory cry a second time, this instead becomes a +1 morale bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus to saving throws for 1 round.</p>\n<h3>Take a Breather!*</h3>\n<p>The triggering ally can immediately attempt a new saving throw against a single affliction that is affecting them. Failing this saving throw does not worsen the affliction. If you learn this victory cry a second time, the ally also gains a +4 morale bonus to this saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Tread Carefully!</h3>\n<p>Each creature affected by this victory cry can move an additional 5 feet when taking a guarded step on their next turn; this additional 5 feet of movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

However, other characters can become espionage specialists, especially individuals with a talent for crafting disguises, hacking, or engaging in other forms of subterfuge.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>This archetype grants alternate class features at 4th, 9th, and 12th levels.</p>\n<h2>Covert Expert (Ex) - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You excel at infiltration, and covert missions are your specialty. Bluff, Disguise, and Stealth are class skills for you, if they aren’t already. Once per day when you attempt a Bluff check, a Disguise check, or a Stealth check, you can roll twice and use the better result. You can use this ability additional times per day by expending 1 Resolve Point for each use after the first.</p>\n<h2>Improvised Forgery (Ex) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>To do your work, you can’t afford to be recognized, and you also need to impersonate rival personnel—sometimes on short notice. Therefore, you have created numerous identities for yourself, with names and electronic documents to back them up. You find it easy to slip into any of your assumed personas with but a few moments of mental calibration and physical preparation.</p>\n<p>Once per day as a full action, so long as you have access to an upgraded comm unit, a datapad, or any other type of computer, you can produce a false identity complete with forged documents, an official identification card or badge, and a minimal infosphere presence. As normal when creating forged documents, you must attempt a Computers skill check to create the forgery, and any creatures scrutinizing any of your documents can attempt an opposed Computers check to detect the forgery, with all the normal DC modifiers for other circumstances. If your forged identity includes significantly changing your visual appearance, you can use the result of your Computers check for your Disguise check to change your appearance, though you still must use a disguise kit, a spell such as disguise self, or a technological device such as a holoskin when using this aspect of improvised forgery.</p>\n<h2>Backstabber (Ex) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>One moment you might be schmoozing with a rival executive in a private office, and the next moment you’re assassinating them. You gain Fast-Talk, Greater Feint, or Improved Feint as a bonus feat. If you already have all these feats, you can select another feat for which you meet the prerequisites as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever you attack and hit someone who is flat-footed, such as during a surprise round, you deal that target an extra 1d8 damage of the same type your weapon normally deals.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"COM pg. 101"}}

Sometimes doing so means the fixer gets their hands dirty with work no one else is willing or trained to do, such as cleaning a crime scene and hiding the evidence before it can come to light. At other times, being a fixer means being a master of data manipulation who can cover up a virtual trail, create a new identity, grease the right cogs in the bureaucratic machine, or contact other serious professionals, such as assassins, thieves, smugglers, and all manner of other specialists willing to do illegal jobs. Fixers also know how to smuggle goods and people, moving them before authorities can catch up with seizure orders or arrest warrants.</p>\n<p>A good fixer is often in some other business with little plausible connection to criminal enterprises. The fixer themself doesn’t become involved in active criminal jobs, so no links exist to tie the fixer to the crime. Instead, the fixer shows up only when needed to fix a specific situation, then goes back to their normal life. Law enforcement shouldn’t be able to place the fixer within a list of suspects, much less link the fixer to a crime scene.</p>\n<p>Conversely, fixers can be famous in the criminal world for their specialty skills, sometimes going by a working name. Reliable fixers are often on the payroll of mob bosses, gang leaders, and other criminal syndicates, although they are just as often employees of legitimate organizations. The fixer works on retainer and is on call for those inevitable late nights when events go sideways. Some fixers are no stranger to violence, though such tactics are seldom a fixer’s first recourse, since they draw attention and leave a mess the fixer inevitably has to clean up.

The DC for this check is 15 + the highest CR or level of the people or things you want to transport. Add 5 to this DC if the people or things are well known or being actively sought by legal authorities. If you succeed at this check, transportation is available within 1 day. You do not need to pay for this transportation, but you might end up owing a few favors.</p>\n<h2>Information Fixer (Ex) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>You know how to cover up information in the real world and on infospheres. When you negotiate with someone to protect a secret, lower the DC of Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks you attempt by 5. You can expend 1 Resolve Point to treat the d20 roll in such situations as a 20.</p>\n<p>In addition, with special software from your cleaner’s kit and a hacker’s kit, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to find and erase data from one infosphere to which you have access. Doing so takes 1d4 hours. The data you erase is limited to a general topic, like that stored on a secure data module (Starfinder Core Rulebook 215), although this ability does not erase data stored on such a module, only from the infosphere itself. The data you erase is only superficially deleted from the infosphere. Data backups restore the information 1d4+1 days after</p>\n<h2>Criminal Network (Ex) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>You have an array of criminal contacts, so you know who to call when you need a tip, and your contacts are usually willing to help or point you to someone who can. Reduce your DC to gather information on criminal enterprises and figures by 5. When you communicate or meet with a criminal for the first time, improve their initial attitude toward you by one step.</p>\n<p>Your reputation also helps you coerce others. When you use Intimidate to bully someone who has heard of either you or those for whom you work, the effect of a successful check lasts for 1d6 days.</p>\n<h2>Dark Rep (Ex) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>Among criminals, your name is spoken in a respectful tone. Lower the DC of Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks you attempt against criminals who know of you by 5. In addition, as a full action, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 60 feet. The DC of this check is the highest DC to demoralize any one of those foes.

The DC for another creature to find or follow your tracks is 20 + 1-1/2 × your ranks in Stealth or Survival (your choice), no matter what circumstances, surfaces, or conditions you travel in. If you mask or cover allies’ tracks, taking at least a full action to do so, this DC also applies to checks to find or follow those tracks. In addition, when you attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance, you can affect yourself and up to six allies.

This excess energy can be used only to directly power an object, and not to recharge a battery or item.</p>\n<p>When calculating how many Resolve Points you must spend to stabilize, subtract half your number of augmentations from your maximum Resolve Points. When you spend any Resolve Points to stabilize, you can also attempt a saving throw against one bleeding or burning condition affecting you against the effect’s original DC (or if there was no save, a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the source’s CR). If you succeed at the save, the condition ends.</p>\n<h2>Overclocked Systems (Ex) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>The fusion between your natural form and your augmentations surpasses either’s intended limits. As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to choose one personal upgrade you have and gain a temporary benefit based on the ability score it augments. The benefit increases based on the model type, treating mk 1 as 1, mk 2 as 2, and mk 3 as 3 for the purpose of calculating the effect. At 13th level you can gain the associated benefits for two of your personal upgrades, and at 17th level you can gain the associated benefits for up to three of your personal upgrades. These benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your character level.</p>\n<p>Strength: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Strength upgrade’s model to all Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks. Reduce your armor check penalty by an amount equal to your model type (minimum 0).</p>\n<p>Dexterity: Each of your modes of movement increases by an amount equal to 10 ft. × your Dexterity upgrade’s model, to a maximum of twice your normal speed for each.</p>\n<p>Constitution: At the end of your turn you regain Stamina Points equal to 3 × your Constitution upgrade’s model.</p>\n<p>Intelligence: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Intelligence upgrade’s model to all Intelligence-based skill checks and ability checks. Your critical hits deal additional damage equal to 4 × your model type.</p>\n<p>Wisdom: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Wisdom upgrade’s model to all Wisdom-based skill checks and ability checks as well as to initiative checks.</p>\n<p>Charisma: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Charisma upgrade’s model to all Charisma-based skill checks and ability checks. As a reaction, you can allow any ally that can see or hear you within 30 feet to reroll one attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Using this reaction immediately ends all of your overclocked systems benefits.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":""}}

While many Skyfire legionnaires form a near-telepathic bond with dragonkin copilots, Skyfire centurions train to strengthen this connection even further, leading their allies and facilitating teamwork almost as if the members shared a single mind.</p>\n<p>The Skyfire Legion has several training facilities throughout the Pact Worlds where centurions and other legionnaires can hone their skills. Every legionnaire trains with a partner, and centurions undergo additional, stricter regimens to help focus their minds and toughen up their bodies.</p>\n<p>Not all members of the Skyfire Legion are centurions, and not all centurions have a dragonkin ally; the same teamwork techniques can be used with any intelligent creatures, even mechanical ones. Characters of all classes can become successful centurions, though most mystics and solarians lack the piloting ability to make full use of centurion abilities. Soldiers gain many combat feats, which makes them terrific centurions, while mechanics who choose their drones as their bonded allies can customize the drones for seamless teamwork.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The Skyfire centurion archetype grants alternate class features at 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th levels.</p>\n<h2>Combat Bond (Ex) - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You can train together with an ally whose Intelligence score is at least 1, forming a combat bond between you and the target creature. This training process takes 1 hour, and you can have only one bonded ally at a time. If you form a new combat bond with a creature, any previously formed combat bond is lost.

As a move action, you can grant your bonded ally a single combat feat you have for 10 rounds, provided your bonded ally can see or hear you. The bonded ally must fulfill the feat’s prerequisites and be able to use the feat. For example, a mechanic’s drone can benefit only from feats that a drone can normally gain. If you have already granted your bonded ally a feat using this ability, the previous feat is lost.</p>\n<h2>Concentrated Fire (Ex) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>When you and your bonded ally both ready an action to attack the same target and choose the same condition for the readied action, when you and your bonded ally make those attacks, use the highest of the two attack rolls (each attacker applies her own modifiers to the roll).

Your bonded ally can take actions as normal on her next turn, but you are staggered until the end of your next turn. To use this ability, your bonded ally must have fewer than one-quarter her maximum Resolve Points. You can use this ability if your bonded ally normally has no Resolve Points. You can’t use this ability on the same bonded ally again until you have recovered your Resolve Points after an 8-hour rest or its equivalent, but if you change the target of your combat bond ability before that, you can use this ability on the new bonded ally, provided you have Resolve Points to spend.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"PW pg. 185"}}

They thus use their supernatural talents to augment other options rather than drawing on them as their primary source of power.</p>\n<p>The majority of phrenic adepts are lashuntas and shirrens, though members of other races can also develop such psychic abilities. It is unusual for phrenic adepts to also be mystics or technomancers, as most spellcasters channel all their eldritch power into their class training, but it is not unknown.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The phrenic adept grants alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<h2>Phrenic Awakening (Su) - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>You gain limited telepathy, as per the lashunta racial trait (see page 48).

If the spell or ability has a duration of 2 rounds or longer, reduce its duration by half.</p>\n<h2>Phrenic Senses (Sp) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain the power to sense mental abilities and the creatures who have them. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate your phrenic senses. This acts as the spell arcane sight, except you see only magic sources with the emotion, fear, mind-affecting, or pain descriptor. If you succeed at a Mysticism check to determine a source’s school of magic, you also learn which of these descriptors apply to it. If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action to determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities (see arcane sight on page 340), you learn only that it does if at least one of those abilities has one of these descriptors, and you learn the caster level of only the most powerful of these abilities.</p>\n<p>While your phrenic senses are active, you also gain blindsense (emotion) with a range of 30 feet.

You can target one creature per 2 class levels, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart and all of which must be within 100 feet of you. Each target must succeed at a Will save or be staggered and forced to treat all creatures as having concealment (see page 253) for 1 round per class level you have.

Others claim their special diet has purged all toxins from their system and granted them a supernatural ability to fend off poisons and diseases. Still more assert that their diligent study and memorization of their texts have improved their understanding of laws and commerce, boosting their ability to turn friendly connections into trading empires.</p>\n<p>Whatever the commonality may be, one key truth is that each Kalistocrat is on their own personal path of enlightenment.

This choice is made after a 10-minute meditation following an 8-hour rest and can only be changed once every 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Cultural Studies (Ex) 2nd Level</h3>\n<p>Your study and broad knowledge of cultural touchstones helps inform your interactions with creatures of all backgrounds. Culture is a class skill for you, but if you gain or have Culture as a class skill from another source, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with the skill. You can use Culture in place of Diplomacy to change a creature’s attitude towards you. Once per day, after failing a check to change a creature’s attitude by 5 or more, you can spend a Resolve Point to not worsen their attitude.</p>\n<h3>Diverse Contacts (Ex) 2nd Level</h3>\n<p>The connections you’ve made on your travels allow you to reach out and get some information from somebody knowledgeable on many topics. Diplomacy is a class skill for you, but if you gain or have Diplomacy as a class skill from another source, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with the skill. You can use Diplomacy in place of Mysticism to identify a creature or magic item that you can describe or otherwise provide information about, taking the same amount of time as gathering information. Also, once a week, you can bargain with a merchant whose attitude you previously changed to helpful to purchase a single magic or hybrid item at a 10% discount; this discount doesn’t stack with any other discounts you might have.</p>\n<h3>Mystic Decoder (Ex) 2nd Level</h3>\n<p>Meditating on Kalistrade’s writings and prophecies have given you another way to look at and solve indecipherable writings. Mysticism is a class skill for you, but if you have or gain Mysticism as a class skill from another source, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with the skill. You can use Mysticism to meditate on the meaning of archaic, encoded, or incomplete messages instead of attempting a Culture check. You can also use Mysticism instead of Bluff to pass a secret message to another Kalistocrat by concealing it in phrases and passages from Kalistrade’s Ontologies of Self.</p>\n<h2>Kalistocrat Alternate 4th-level Class Feature</h2>\n<p>A Kalistocrat of 4th level or higher can gain the following class feature.</p>\n<h3>Network Building (Ex) 4th Level</h3>\n<p>You excel at meeting people and making friends from all walks of life. Culture, Diplomacy, and Mysticism are class skills for you, if they aren’t already. When doing business with somebody for the first time and attempting a check with one of these skills, you can spend a Resolve Point to roll the check twice and use the better result. Additionally, reduce the DC of checks to recall knowledge or gather information about new people and contacts by 5.</p>\n<h2>Kalistocrat Alternate 6th-level Class Features</h2>\n<p>A Kalistocrat of 6th level or higher can select from among the following class features.</p>\n<h3>Improved Fitness (Ex) 6th Level</h3>\n<p>Your meditations have allowed you to exert power over your body that you might not be able to do otherwise. Each day, choose one of the following feats as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites: Improved Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will, Improved Lightning Reflexes. If your chosen feat’s prerequisites are met by the feat chosen for Body and Mind, you don’t have to spend a Resolve Point the first time you reroll a failed save each day.</p>\n<h3>Healthy Meditation (Ex) 6th Level</h3>\n<p>Following the path of a prophet pays off when it comes to your health and fitness. As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against poisons and diseases. When recovering from ability damage, you can undertake a night of meditation in place of a normal full night’s rest to improve your health as if you took a day of bed rest (though you don’t also gain the benefits of a normal full night’s rest).</p>\n<p>Also, the ways in which you define yourself as a Kalistocrat can provide the following options for modifying long-term care you receive. If Culture is a class skill for you, you can attempt a DC 20 Culture check (representing knowledge of special foods or custom remedies outside the mainstream medical texts) to provide assistance; if successful, the person attempting the Medicine check for your long-term care gains a +4 circumstance bonus. If Diplomacy is a class skill for you, you can reach out to a nearby doctor you know or that has heard of you to grant a reroll to the person attempting the Medicine check for your long-term care; you must be within a settlement or be able to contact a doctor within hours to apply this bonus. If Mysticism is a class skill for you, you can provide long-term care to yourself by entering a day-long meditative state that doesn’t require a medical lab or medical bay; attempt a DC 30 Mysticism check with a –4 penalty to gain the benefits of long-term care.

You can cast spells with a range of touch into a melee weapon you hold. The spell is held within your weapon for up to one minute; if you successfully hit an enemy with the weapon, the spell discharges, targeting that enemy. If you are no longer holding the weapon, the spell dissipates harmlessly. Spell damage and weapon damage affect the target separately. If the spell you cast allows an attack as part of casting the spell (such as jolting surge), you can cast the spell into your weapon and attack in the same turn. In addition, for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, you treat your class level as your base attack bonus.</p>\n<h2>Cantrip Specialization (Su) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>Casters who find themselves behind enemy lines must conserve their most potent spells, making use of what they have at hand. You can cast a cantrip that deals damage and has a casting time of 1 standard action as a full action; when you do, add your caster level to the cantrip’s damage.</p>\n<h2>Flash Flourish (Su) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>The ability to change your position, even across short distances, can bring victory from sure defeat. After you make a successful melee attack, you can teleport up to 10 feet. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once you’ve used flash flourish, you can’t do so again until after you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge the ability immediately.</p>\n<h2>Flash Stab (Su) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>When you make a full attack in melee against a single opponent, you can teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space between your attacks; the target of your melee attacks must be within your reach at both the beginning and end of this teleport. When you do so, you flank the opponent with your final attack. Once you have used flash stab, you can’t use it again until after you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge the ability immediately. In addition, the range of your flash flourish teleport increases to 20 feet.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"AP #30 pg. 51"}}

This lethal strike attack deals damage as normal, and the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your key ability modifier) or take 1d6 additional damage per your character level. If the target fails the save, it must also attempt a second Fortitude saving throw with the same DC. If it fails this second save, it dies instantly; this is a death effect.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you kill a creature using your lethal strike, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by Perception checks to notice by those in the vicinity; if successful, you prevent those nearby from identifying you as the attacker. If you succeed by 5 or more, bystanders might not even immediately notice that the target is dead (at the GM’s discretion).</p>\n<h2>Exploitative Strike (Ex) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>When you use lethal strike, you can force your target to roll its initial save twice and take the worse result. Alternatively, when a target that you studied on your previous turn is within your reach and an ally’s attack results in a critical hit against it, you can activate lethal strike as a reaction.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"NS pg. 143"}}
{"_id":"xrs17KSKn6uMIvCN","name":"Mediator","type":"archetypes","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","system":{"type":"","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>With innumerable species populating the Pact Worlds, Near Space, and the worlds beyond, conflicts, disagreements, and misunderstandings inevitably arise between groups. To help mitigate any major consequences to such disputes, many take it upon themselves to act as peacemakers. These mediators are sometimes simply well-intentioned, skilled individuals who wish to put their talents to good use and help others around them. Other times, mediators receive specialized training to help deal with conflicts in formalized or professional settings. Regardless of their specific methods, most mediators learn to tap into an innate emotional and psychological understanding of others to help act as efficient arbitrators.</p>\n<p>Most classes can make suitable mediators, but many tend to be envoys and mystics. Whatever their original training and skills, mediators can be quite helpful when navigating a range of difficult or tense situations, such as mediating peaceful diplomatic talks, facilitating corporate mergers, or negotiating surrender after a deadly battle. As for which species tend toward arbitration roles, mediator’s empathic abilities can be difficult to develop intentionally, but a number of species such as brenneris, damais, and vlakas are often particularly emotionally attuned, making them natural mediators.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The mediator archetype grants alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 12th levels.</p>\n<h2>Diplomatic Nuance (Ex) - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>You gain Culture and Diplomacy as class skills. For each of these skills that is already a class skill for you (or becomes a class skill) from a source other than this archetype, you learn to speak and read a new language. See page 41 of the Core Rulebook for a list of languages spoken in the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p>\n<p>You can use your Diplomacy skill for Bluff checks to lie or pass a secret message and your Culture skill for Life Science checks to identify humanoids and monstrous humanoids. When you attempt a Diplomacy check to change a creature’s attitude, the creature’s attitude worsens only if you fail the check by 10 or more, rather than if you fail the check by 5 or more.</p>\n<h2>Expert Negotiator (Ex) - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You are highly skilled at convincing others and reaching amicable agreements. If a creature’s initial attitude toward you would be unfriendly, indifferent, or friendly, you instead treat its attitude as one category higher. When you fail a Diplomacy check to change the attitude of a hostile creature by 10 or less, you can attempt to change its attitude again. Whenever an ally uses aid another to assist you with a Diplomacy check to change a creature’s attitude, if you succeed at that check, the targeted creature’s attitude toward your ally also improves.</p>\n<h2>Speaker of Many Worlds (Sp) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>You can draw upon all known languages to make yourself understood in almost any situation. You gain the ability to cast tongues once per day as a spell-like ability. In addition, once per day as a full action, you can touch up to two willing creatures with an Intelligence modifier of at least –3 and grant them the ability to communicate with you and each other as though under the effect of tongues. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you end it with a swift action. This is a mind-affecting affect.</p>\n<h2>Empathic Link (Su) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>You create a mental and emotional bond between yourself and other creatures. As a full action, you can touch up to two willing or unconscious creatures to create an empathic link between yourself and each creature touched. This empathic link lasts for 1 hour or until you end it for all creatures with a swift action. While linked, you and the linked creatures gain the effects of status in relation to one another.</p>\n<p>Linked creatures have an automatic emotional connection that allows them to better understand each other’s feelings as well as provide a constant and passive psychological comfort and support. Whenever a linked creature fails a Will saving throw, a different linked creature can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to allow the affected creature to reroll its failed saving throw. If the effect is an emotion or fear effect, the affected creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to this reroll. The creature must use the second result, even if it’s worse. An affected creature can reroll a given saving throw only once in this manner.</p>\n<p>Finally, you and the linked creatures learn how to anticipate each other’s needs and actions. Once per day at the beginning of combat, each linked creature can swap their initiative result with that of any other linked creature within 60 feet.</p>"},"grants":{"levels":[]},"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","source":"NS pg. 147"}}
