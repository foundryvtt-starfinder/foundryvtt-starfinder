Armed with ineffable resilience and keenly developed senses, you greet each new adventure with zeal and reverence, drinking in the world around you with boundless enthusiasm.

You might approach new encounters with reckless abandon or take a more thoughtful path, but whatever route you choose, finding new sensations fulfills you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">1ST)</span></h2>\n<p>Always in search of new sensations, you have spent significant time learning about the cultures of the Pact Worlds and have gained a breadth of cultural knowledge, from the composition styles of Vercite ether-ballads to quantum-flavored Idaran cuisine or the latest textiles in Kalo-Mahoi fashions. Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about artistic innovations and traditions by 5. Given your propensity for trying new things, you’ve also found it prudent to understand the distinction between delightful experiences and those that are ill-advised, permanently injurious, or even fatal. Reduce the DC of Life Science checks by 5 when identifying consumables such as drugs, medicinals, poisons, food, and drink.<br>Perception is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Perception checks.

This talent is valuable when you try to talk others into allowing you access to new experiences. Strangers might not understand your motivations, but your passion is contagious, and your ardent quest endears you to those who share your curiosity.

After all, if a thrill resulted in serious injury or even death, it’s possible you could never feel a new sensation again! Despite the risk, you refuse to let fear stop you from seeing as much of the galaxy as your limits allow. You’ve successfully survived each moment of your life so far, haven’t you? With such an optimistic outlook toward the future, you gain a +1 morale bonus to Will saving throws against fear effects. In addition, once per day when you are affected by a fear effect, as a reaction, you can delay the onset of that effect for 1 round. Once the fear starts to affect you, it then has its normal duration from that point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SENSATION JUNKY (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>New experiences fulfill and exhilarate you, stoking your enthusiasm for the wondrous galaxy you inhabit, the opportunities it presents, and all it has to offer. Twice per day, you can enjoy a new experience that takes 10 minutes or longer. As an alternative, you can spend 10 minutes or longer processing a recent new experience in some way. You might make a digital record or write in a physical journal, discuss the experience, debate whether you’d repeat it, bask in the satisfaction of fulfilling your curiosity, or engage in similar reflection. If you do so, you regain 1 Resolve Point.

They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments&nbsp;</strong>+2 to any one ability score<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feat</h2>\n<p>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Skilled</h2>\n<p>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />The cultural, genetic, and mystical influences that some humans are subjected to can produce racial traits different from the norm.</p>\n<h2>Adopted</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />Many humans thrive in racially diverse metropolitan areas, and some individuals are adopted by members of a different species.

Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice.

You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level.

If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability.

This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

The only son of miners on a planetoid called Pikora 317, Zemir spent his earliest days exposed to the harsh reality of life in a corporate labor colony, where his parents toiled in the Freugan Salvage Company&rsquo;s starmetal mines.</p>\n<p>Even as a toddler, Zemir&rsquo;s gaiety and thirst for new experiences were readily apparent. The vivacious boy quickly became known for his curiosity and his many troublesome talents, such as sneaking into seemingly inaccessible places, turning neat collections of supplies into epic messes, and even finding ways to manipulate control panels into colorful, sparking displays. In fact, whenever a commonplace utility malfunctioned around the Solodan home, his parents joked that the &ldquo;Zemir effect&rdquo; had struck again.</p>\n<p>Around Zemir&rsquo;s fifth birthday, it seemed that the boy&rsquo;s body began to betray him. Despite his healthy diet and robust physical activity, testing indicated that the boy was dangerously malnourished. Even stranger, after every meal, Zemir&rsquo;s breath smelled eerily similar to his favorite sweet treats, perhaps an indication of a dangerous blood disease, doctors speculated. His condition continued to deterioriate, but doctors proved incapable of explaining or treating it. Desperate for answers, his parents took to posting details of their son&rsquo;s strange condition on every related infosphere portal they could find.</p>\n<p>In just a few days, the Solodans&rsquo; pleas elicited a mysterious message from a Dr. Fainoro Corone, who requested to observe the boy in person. Zemir&rsquo;s parents readily welcomed the quiet damaya lashunta doctor into their home. For a full day, Dr. Corone watched Zemir&rsquo;s every move, focusing on the boy&rsquo;s behavior at meal times. As Zemir slurped at his nutritional broth with surprising glee, Dr. Corone studied him closely. At the doctor&rsquo;s and his mother&rsquo;s insistence, the boy opened his mouth. A thin film of custard clung to his baby teeth, and his breath smelled like sweet milk.</p>\n<p>Zemir was not suffering from a physical ailment. The boy was instead, in the subtlest of ways, warping the fabric of reality to suit his childish preferences. Similarly, the messes and mischief he had caused around the residential complex were the result of the boy&rsquo;s ability to shift reality ever-so-slightly for his own amusement.</p>\n<p>Zemir was a witchwarper&mdash;one who understands that the universe consists of infinite realities. What&rsquo;s more, witchwarpers possess the innate ability to peer into those worlds, and to mix and manipulate them at will. Most witchwarpers&rsquo; abilities manifested in adulthood, but Zemir was special.</p>\n<p>The doctor offered the family reality-stabilizing bracers to dampen his abilities and give him a traditional childhood. But he also explained that the family had another choice: enroll the boy in the Institute for Extraordinary Minds. Dr. Corone explained that, like Zemir, he was a witchwarper and that others at the institute could help Zemir learn control over his abilities. The doctor offered full tuition for Zemir and unrestricted visitation privileges for his family. Though saddened, Zemir&rsquo;s parents understood the value of this offer and agreed.</p>\n<p>For the next twelve years, Zemir studied as Dr. Corone&rsquo;s protege, honing his ability to manipulate his surroundings, growing more delighted each time he created a new sound, smell, or, especially, taste. He eagerly learned about far-away cuisine and cultures, dreaming of one day traveling throughout this reality and perhaps an infinite number of others. During this time, Zemir also learned of Eloritu, the god of magic and secrets, and came to view the infinite cosmos as a gift from this mysterious deity.</p>\n<p>Near Zemir&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday, the witchwarper began the early stages of his final thesis project: an ambitious attempt to create a minute-long rift into a reality adjacent to his own. The institute&rsquo;s professors approved the project only under their strict supervision.</p>\n<p>Zemir bristled at such restrictions. And so, under the cover of night, he convinced three of his closest friends to participate in a dry-run of his experiment. With no safeguards in place, Zemir used his substantial willpower to tear open a rift in reality. A primal scream rent his lips and a shock of his hair whitened under the great mental strain. Ecstatic, terrified, but trusting their brilliant friend, Zemir&rsquo;s classmates stepped through the rift, which immediately winked out. The human Alena Nidaro, the half-elf Tornil Lee, and the ysoki Smidge disappeared from this reality. Try as he might, Zemir could not reopen the rift nor could he find any trace of his friends.</p>\n<p>Panicked, Zemir fled the Institute for Extraordinary Minds, retreating to Absalom Station. He wandered the station in a haze for weeks, performing minor tricks of warped reality for the credits he needed to survive. Eventually, Zemir sent a message to Dr. Corone to confess what he had done, then deactivated his institute communications account.</p>\n<p>Despite the institute&rsquo;s best efforts to track Zemir down and get some answers, Dr. Corone and his colleagues have always remained one step behind. Although his wits returned, Zemir&rsquo;s scars are far from healed. He now travels to all corners of this reality, as much seeking to earn a living using his strange magic and indulge his love of new experiences as attempting to run from a guilty conscience.</p>\n<p>Growing ever more powerful daily, Zemir is a mysterious and joyful&mdash;if occasionally morose&mdash;companion to those who share his goals. He&rsquo;s known for waxing eloquent about the tapestry of existence and the dangers that other realities hold. The wise heed the witchwarper&rsquo;s words, for Zemir has looked into infinite realities&mdash;and vowed never to lose another companion to the fray again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p>Infinite Worlds (Su) As a standard action, Zemir can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into his current universe. He expends a 1st-level witchwarper spell slot to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for 1 round unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, Zemir can create an instantaneous effect, such as a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules. They have a range of 110 feet and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 14 + the spell level expended to create the effect. Zemir can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The environmental and instantaneous effects he can create by expending a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental):</strong> Zemir causes the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. Zemir can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When he creates difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a &ldquo;1&rdquo;), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Zemir can cast the following spells, each as a standard action (except as noted):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charming Veneer</span></em>: Zemir can cast this spell on a creature within 110 feet. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and a creature can only be affected by this spell once per 24 hours.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Detect Magic</em></span>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Hazard</em></span>: When Zemir casts this spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell gains that descriptor. Zemir summons a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid rain, a blast of freezing air, a static electric discharge, a burst of fire, or a roar of thunder in a 5-foot-radius burst within 25 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 14) or take 1d3 damage of the chosen type.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Psychokinetic Hand</em></span>: Zemir points his finger at an object within 25 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less (or up to 1 bulk), gaining the ability to lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, he can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Puncture Veil</em></span>: Zemir creates microscopic tears in reality that deal 1d4 piercing damage to a creature within 110 feet. The affected creature also gains the bleeding condition (1 damage) for 3 rounds. Zemir can instead cast this spell as a full action to either target two creatures within 20 feet of each other or to target one creature and deal 2d4 piercing damage, granting the bleeding condition (2 damage) for 3 rounds.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Shifting Surge</em></span>: Zemir touches a willing creature and affects one of their energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of his next turn. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness </strong>Zemir gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Gem of Comprehend Languages</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can destroy this object to cast comprehend languages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Comprehend Languages</em></span>: Zemir can understand the spoken or signed words of creatures or read incomprehensible written or tactile messages. He can read and understand an unknown language but cannot speak or write it. This lasts for 10 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Second Skin</strong> While wearing this armor, Zemir can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 24 hours.</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":1,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":1,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":1,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":1,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":1,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":"3","value":"3"},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["common","vesk"]},"senses":"","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Zemir L1","actorId":"0TihUfqGWdOeBuuH","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Generations ago, however, a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the hive mind, with each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism, these renegades rejected the Swarm&rsquo;s mindless consumption, forming a new race called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.</p>\n<p>Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae. Unlike many arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands. In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these &ldquo;mating arms&rdquo; are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes&mdash;to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p>\n<p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. In some shirren societies, a single host queen incubates for many partners and is considered the true parent, while in others, three-party marriages are common. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and they are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Not even shirrens know where the Swarm first evolved, for its vast biological colony-fleet has traveled the stars for ages and feels no need to keep track of such things. After splitting from the Swarm, the newly self-aware shirrens scattered to a number of nearby systems. A large contingent found its way to the Pact Worlds, making first contact with Vercite aethership crews and setting up a colony in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}&rsquo;s parched Fullbright region. Since then, shirrens have spread throughout the Pact Worlds.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm, they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While this ability is not always beneficial&mdash;some shirrens deliberately drug themselves this way, becoming &ldquo;option junkies&rdquo; blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions&mdash;freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. This is especially true with regard to religion, for what choice is more important than how to spend the afterlife?</p>\n<p>At the same time, having evolved from hive creatures, shirrens remain highly communal by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} standards. Even when working with other races, they seek to foster community and teamwork and do what&rsquo;s best for the group. They are often lawful good, though loyalty and a utilitarian emphasis on &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; can also lead them down questionable paths.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Most of the common races find shirrens agreeable and useful allies, though their telepathic communication and chittering mouthparts can be disconcerting. Shirrens, for their part, are positively inclined toward all the major races, especially ysoki for their communal tendencies and zest for life. Though lashuntas often maintain their prejudice against insectile races, most shirrens don&rsquo;t hold this against them, as they themselves fear nothing more than the Swarm that spawned them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Less inclined toward violence than many races, shirrens often sign on with starship crews as ambassadors, medics, technicians, and other such noncombat roles, especially as mystics acting as ship chaplains. They adore working as part of a team and are often voices of reason in chaotic situations. This general friendliness should not be mistaken for weakness, however, as shirrens fighting for the lives of their comrades can be terrifyingly lethal, fearlessly undertaking suicidal missions for the good of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-6 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-150 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>5 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>50+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are Medium humanoids with the shirren subtype.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Shirrens&rsquo; sensitive antennae grant them blindsense (vibration)&mdash;the ability to sense vibrations in the air&mdash;with a range of 30 feet.

Mysticism becomes a class skill for you, though if it&rsquo;s a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Mysticism checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Wisdom at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MANTLE OF THE CLERGY (6TH)</h2>\n<p>You have reached a rank of authority in your religion. Typical lay followers of your religion have a starting attitude of helpful toward you and will often provide you with simple assistance on request due to some combination of adoration, respect, or fear (depending on your religion), and even other clergy must give your opinions due consideration in matters of disagreement. You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against lay followers and lowerranking clergy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>DIVINE BOON (12TH)</h2>\n<p>Your deity grants you mystic power. Choose one 1stlevel mystic spell with some connection to your deity&rsquo;s portfolio (subject to the GM&rsquo;s approval). If you have levels in the mystic class, you gain 1 additional 1stlevel spell per day and add the chosen spell to your list of mystic spells known. Otherwise, you can use the chosen spell once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>TRUE COMMUNION (18TH)</h2>\n<p>Up to twice per day, after performing a significant action strongly aligned with your faith&rsquo;s dogma (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), you can spend 10 minutes in deep meditation or prayer to regain 1 Resolve Point; this doesn&rsquo;t count as resting to regain Stamina Points.</p>"},"modifiers":[],"skill":"mys","source":"CRB page 34"}},{"_id":"ythsrjvFgHVddPCi","name":"Mystic","type":"class","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/mystic.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"bab":"moderate","critical":{"parts":[]},"csk":{"acr":false,"ath":false,"blu":true,"com":false,"cul":true,"dip":true,"dis":true,"eng":false,"int":true,"lsc":true,"med":true,"mys":true,"per":true,"phs":false,"pil":false,"pro":true,"sen":true,"sle":false,"ste":false,"sur":true},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects.

Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–5: Mystic Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem. </span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.SdlB9viiKckPr0LZ]{Connection - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br><br>Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with your connection’s associated skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AFyfOC7qaEpto7f3]{Mindlink (Sp) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use <em>mindlink</em> at will as a spell-like ability, though only once per day on any given individual.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rTaxnu0ObdXF13Sk]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ox6Am16XZqBXJNT9]{Telepathic Bond (Sp) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can form a telepathic link with up to six other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as <em>telepathic bond</em>, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ceEyKkx4fzE4Lp37]{Transcendence (Sp) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are close to becoming one with your connection. You can cast each of your connection spells once per day without consuming a spell slot. In addition, you learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.RmwJt3BRTlTW0D06]{Enlightenment (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast <em>miracle</em> as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dE8h1C8gOUyzeS0J]{Epiphanies}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":true,"kas":"wis","levels":4,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":6},"source":"CRB, p. 82","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"will":"fast"}},{"_id":"rnAtRVN2MNcyzjsE","name":"Harm Undead","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/feats/harm_undead.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>You can use your healing channel to harm undead.<br><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Healing channel connection power, mystic level 1st.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use your healing channel, you can expend a mystic spell slot of the highest level you can cast to also deal damage equal to the amount you heal to all undead foes in the area.

The child of a priest of Hylax, Keskodai always felt a deep connection to the divine, yet chafed at the idea of serving the same god as his parent. Exactly which god he&rsquo;d serve instead remained unclear, until the coming of the Gray Shakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Believed to be the result of a biotech experiment gone wrong, the plague called the Gray Shakes burned through the city like wildfire, turning shirrens&rsquo; chitin gray, rotting off their antennae, and eating away at their telepathy and motor functions, leaving them awake but unable to communicate until they finally expired. In the weeks it took the government to find a cure, thirty percent of the city&rsquo;s shirren population died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the midst of this horror, a young Keskodai first encountered priests of Pharasma. Somberly, the Pharasmins walked among the afflicted, offering healing where they could and comfort to those too far gone, whispering to them of the Cycle of Souls and the new worlds that awaited them. The beauty of their ministry moved Keskodai, and he quickly joined their hospice work, leaving home to study at a temple in the Ring of Nations once the plague was safely contained.</p>\n<p>After years as an initiate, Keskodai returned home a full priest of Lady of Graves. He quickly fell in love with and married two members of his congregation, a female-host couple. Yet part of him remained unsatisfied. He began to wonder if he&rsquo;d made the right choice in coming home. How could he know if he wanted this when there was still so much out there that he&rsquo;d never experienced? The desire to explore continued to grow, until at last, after the birth of their first son, he and his partners agreed that Keskodai would leave and see the galaxy, taking their child with him to expose him to the same new experiences. Once the child was old enough to leave his cradle-jar, Keskodai would decide whether he&rsquo;d seen enough to return in good conscience, in which case both of them be welcomed with open arms. If not, the child would return alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his effort to see as many worlds as possible, Keskodai signs on with freelance adventurers. While capable in combat, he prefers to act as the ship&rsquo;s medic, patching up broken allies or blessing them on their journey into the Great Beyond. The cheerful manner in which he talks about death often disturbs those under his care, yet anyone who spends much time with the shirren quickly learns that his even-keeled, fatalistic approach to life and death makes him an excellent healer.</p>\n<p>As with many shirren, Keskodai is a team player and a social butterfly who loves meeting new people. A crewmate once called him &ldquo;the galaxy&rsquo;s friendliest death priest,&rdquo; and he wears the badge with pride. Though fond of option bars and other artificial means of stimulating his choice centers, he&rsquo;s careful not to let himself overindulge&hellip; usually. He&rsquo;s intensely proud of the aesthetics of his gear, his collection of trophies, and his mustache (which he thinks lends him an air of gravitas). His greatest pride, however, is his son Chk Chk, still in his larval stage. Like many shirren parents, Keskodai carries Chk Chk around in a heavily fortified cradle-jar designed to let the child learn about the world from relative safety. While Chk Chk isn&rsquo;t old enough to truly speak, Keskodai holds conversations with him regularly, with Chk Chk tapping on the glass to answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Blindsense</strong> Keskodai ignores all forms of visual camouflage and invisibility when attempting Perception checks to notice creatures within 30 feet, though creatures he can&rsquo;t see still gain full concealment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Communalism </strong>Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, Keskodai can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Harm Undead</strong> When Keskodai uses healing channel as a full action, he can expend 1 Resolve Point to also deal damage to all undead within 30 feet. The damage is equal to the amount the healing channel heals, though undead can attempt a Will save (DC 16) for half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Healing Channel (Su) </strong>Keskodai can spend 1 RP to restore 4d8 HP to himself (as a move action), an ally touched (as a standard action), or all allies within 30 feet (as a full action).Healing Touch (Su) Once per day, Keskodai can spend 10 minutes to restore 20 Hit Points to an ally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lifelink (Su)</strong> At the start of Keskodai&rsquo;s turn, he can select one ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage. Keskodai restores up to 4 Hit Points to that ally (not to exceed the ally&rsquo;s maximum HP), and takes the same amount of damage to his Hit Points (bypassing his SP). Damage taken from lifelink can&rsquo;t be reduced through any means. This does not take an action.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Keskodai can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mindlink (Sp)</strong> Keskodai can touch a creature to telepathically transmit as much information as could normally be communicated in 10 minutes. Keskodai can use this on a specific creature only once every 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Keskodai can cast the following spells, each as a standard action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Command</em>: Keskodai can give a verbal command (which must be approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt) and target one living creature within 35 feet. For 1 round, the target obeys that command (Will DC 16 negates). This is a compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Affliction</em>: Keskodai can determine whether a creature or object is cursed, diseased, or poisoned, and can determine the exact affliction with a successful Life Science, Medicine, or Wisdom check.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Magic</em>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magicalsource is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em>Disguise Self</em>: Keskodai can change his appearance to that of a different humanoid creature for 40 minutes. He gains a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. Creatures that interact with him in this form can attempt a DC 16 Will save to realize his appearance is illusory.</li>\n<li><em>Fatigue</em>*: Keskodai makes a melee attack with his base attack bonus plus his Wisdom modifier (total +7) against a target&rsquo;s EAC. If the attack hits, the target is fatigued for 4 rounds (Fort DC 15 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Fog Cloud</em>: This spell creates a 20-ft.-radius-spread cloud of fog that grants concealment (a 20% miss chance for attackers) or total concealment (50% miss chance) for creatures more than 5 feet from the attacker.</li>\n<li><em>Lesser Remove Condition</em>*: This spell removes one of the following conditions from a touched target: shaken, sickened, or staggered. This does not remove a disease or other ongoing effect that could cause the target to regain the condition.</li>\n<li><em>Mind Thrust (1st-Level Spell):</em> This spell deals 2d10 damage (Will DC 16 half) to one creature within 35 feet that has an Intelligence score.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mind Thrust (2nd-Level Spell):</em> This spell deals 4d10 damage (Will DC 17 half) to one creature within 35 feet that has an Intelligence score.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mystic Cure* (1st-Level Spell):</em> With a touch, Keskodai can restore 1d8+4 Hit Points to one living creature.</li>\n<li><em>Mystic Cure* (2nd-Level Spell):</em> With a touch, Keskodai can restore 3d8+4 Hit Points to one living creature.</li>\n<li><em>Psychokinetic Hand:</em> Once this spell is cast, as long as Keskodai concentrates (a standard action each round), he can take a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weigh 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. He can&rsquo;t preform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but could push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n<li><em>Reflecting Armor: </em>Once cast, this spell lasts for 40 minutes or until dismissed. When Keskodai takes Hit Point damage from an attack made by a weapon within 100 feet, he can dismiss this spell as a reaction, causing the attacker to take the same amount of damage (to a maximum of 10 damage, Reflex DC 16 half).</li>\n<li><em>Share Language</em>: Keskodai can grant a creature touched to read, understand, and speak (if able) up to three languages Keskodai knows.</li>\n<li><em>Stabilize</em>: This spell causes a dying creature that has 0 Hit Points to stabilize.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Telekinetic Projectile</em>: Keskodai can telekinetically hurl an object weighing up to 5 pounds at a target within 30 feet, making an attack roll (+4 bonus) against its KAC. If he hits, both the target and the object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sub>* Casting this spell does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</sub></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic Medkit</strong> Keskodai can use this kit to attempt a DC 25 Medicine check to treat deadly wounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Battle Staff</strong> If Keskodai hits a foe with this two-handed weapon, he gains a +1 bonus to his AC against melee attacks from that foe for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Defrex Hide</strong> While wearing this armor, Keskodai can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Ring of Resistance</strong> This magic ring grants a +1 resistance bonus to Keskodai&rsquo;s lowest saving throw (this bonus has already been applied to his Fortitude save).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This pistol fires bolts of damaging sonic energy.

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and humans respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Int, -2 Con<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy—which is gained from scientific study and experimentation—manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Sl47PwjLhPkni75T]{Spells (Technomancer)}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You cast spells drawn from the technomancer spell list (see page 338).

Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don’t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you’ve expended all your spell slots for that spell’s level.<br><br>If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.sobLlAGQkmWcFBFx]{Magic Hack - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You have carefully studied the forces that define magic and can manipulate them. You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional magic hack every 3 levels thereafter. When casting a spell, you can apply no more than one magic hack that affects the attributes of a spell (such as distant spell or extended spell). If a magic hack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier. The list of magic hacks appears starting on page 120.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.X45ZYqyHHZNakUuY]{Spell Focus - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Spell Focus as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EVMp2EOpASIpIbFQ]{Techlore (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You rewire your mind to give you greater insight into the nature of magic and technology.

As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>keen senses</em>, or <em>unseen servant</em>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn’t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can’t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br><br>At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <em>darkvision</em>, <em>lesser resistant armor</em>, <em>life bubble</em>, or <em>spider climb</em>.<br><br>At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <em>arcane sight</em>, <em>flight</em> (spell level 3rd or lower), <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>tongues</em>.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ja89jy7LlkSG4Zzu]{Resolve Attunement (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic.

As part of casting a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exchange a number of unused spell slots for a single spell slot of a higher level; this expends the lower-level spell slots. Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn’t count as such for resolve attunement.<br><br>Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p5xoDQXN2ZcWuW71]{Cache Augmentation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Pf9uh67LQ85K52AF]{Cache Hacks (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Nvh2F2YOmAjRbzOz]{Hack Capacitor (Su)}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":5},"isCaster":true,"kas":"int","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 118","sp":{"min":1,"value":5},"will":"fast"}},{"_id":"JaW8ICxGmquJNa6H","name":"Spell Cache (Su)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/spell_cache.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.classes\" data-id=\"IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Technomancer</a></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">As the culmination of your early study of the fundamental forces of the galaxy, you have created a spell cache that allows you to store and access spells.

While often displayed, these &ldquo;mating arms&rdquo; are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes&mdash;to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p>\n<p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. In some shirren societies, a single host queen incubates for many partners and is considered the true parent, while in others, three-party marriages are common. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and they are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Not even shirrens know where the Swarm first evolved, for its vast biological colony-fleet has traveled the stars for ages and feels no need to keep track of such things. After splitting from the Swarm, the newly self-aware shirrens scattered to a number of nearby systems. A large contingent found its way to the Pact Worlds, making first contact with Vercite aethership crews and setting up a colony in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}&rsquo;s parched Fullbright region. Since then, shirrens have spread throughout the Pact Worlds.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm, they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While this ability is not always beneficial&mdash;some shirrens deliberately drug themselves this way, becoming &ldquo;option junkies&rdquo; blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions&mdash;freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. This is especially true with regard to religion, for what choice is more important than how to spend the afterlife?</p>\n<p>At the same time, having evolved from hive creatures, shirrens remain highly communal by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} standards. Even when working with other races, they seek to foster community and teamwork and do what&rsquo;s best for the group. They are often lawful good, though loyalty and a utilitarian emphasis on &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; can also lead them down questionable paths.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Most of the common races find shirrens agreeable and useful allies, though their telepathic communication and chittering mouthparts can be disconcerting. Shirrens, for their part, are positively inclined toward all the major races, especially ysoki for their communal tendencies and zest for life. Though lashuntas often maintain their prejudice against insectile races, most shirrens don&rsquo;t hold this against them, as they themselves fear nothing more than the Swarm that spawned them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Less inclined toward violence than many races, shirrens often sign on with starship crews as ambassadors, medics, technicians, and other such noncombat roles, especially as mystics acting as ship chaplains. They adore working as part of a team and are often voices of reason in chaotic situations. This general friendliness should not be mistaken for weakness, however, as shirrens fighting for the lives of their comrades can be terrifyingly lethal, fearlessly undertaking suicidal missions for the good of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-6 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-150 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>5 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>50+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are Medium humanoids with the shirren subtype.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Shirrens&rsquo; sensitive antennae grant them blindsense (vibration)&mdash;the ability to sense vibrations in the air&mdash;with a range of 30 feet.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–5: Mystic Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place.

The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br><br>Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks.

Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells.

During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers.

The chance of success is rolled by the GM in secret, and a failure produces the same result as the action having neither good nor negative consequences.</li>\n<li><em>Command</em>: Keskodai can give a verbal command (which must be approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt) and target one living creature within 45 feet. For 1 round, the target obeys that command (Will DC 18 negates). This is a compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Affliction</em>: Keskodai can determine whether a creature or object is cursed, diseased, or poisoned, and can determine the exact affliction with a successful Life Science, Medicine, or Wisdom check.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Magic</em>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em>Disguise Self:</em> Keskodai can change his appearance to that of a different humanoid creature for 80 minutes. He gains a +10 bonus to Disguise checks.

If the attack hits, the target is fatigued for 8 rounds (Fort DC 17 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Fog Cloud:</em> This spell creates a 20-ft.-radius-spread cloud of fog that grants concealment (a 20% miss chance for attackers) or total concealment (50% miss chance) for creatures more than 5 feet from the attacker.</li>\n<li><em>Haste</em>: Keskodai grants one creature per level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart, the following benefits for 8 rounds: when making a full attack subjects can still take a move action before or after their attacks; all their modes of movement increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice their normal speed for that form of movement.</li>\n<li><em>Hold Person:</em> One humanoid within 180 feet is paralyzed for 8 rounds (Will 19 negates). The target can attempt a new saving throw each round to tend the effect. This is a compulsion, mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Lesser Remove Condition*: </em>This spell removes one of the following conditions from a touched target: shaken, sickened, or staggered.

He can&rsquo;t preform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer) but could push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n<li><em>Reflecting Armor</em>: Once cast, this spell lasts for 80 minutes or until dismissed. When Keskodai takes Hit Point damage from an attack made by a weapon within 100 feet, he can dismiss this spell as a reaction, causing the attacker to take the same amount of damage (to a maximum of 10 damage, Reflex DC 18 half).</li>\n<li><em>Remove Condition*</em>: As per lesser remove condition, but this spell can also remove any of the following conditions: frightened, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or staggered.</li>\n<li><em>See Invisibility</em>: Keskodai can see invisible and ethereal objects for 80 minutes.</li>\n<li><em>Share Language</em>: Keskodai can grant a creature touched the ability to read, understand, and speak (if able) up to three languages Keskodai knows.</li>\n<li><em>Stabilize</em>: This spell causes a dying creature that has 0 Hit Points to stabilize.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Telekinetic Projectile</em>: Keskodai can telekinetically hurl an object weighing up to 5 pounds at a target within 30 feet, making an attack roll (+8 bonus) against its KAC.

They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition.

Good","biography":{"age":0,"dateOfBirth":"","fullBodyImage":"","gmNotes":null,"height":"","otherVisuals":"","public":"","value":"<p>Born into a prominent family on Absalom Station, the envoy who calls herself Navasi spent much of her childhood avoiding her parents in their &ldquo;sky-villa,&rdquo; as they called their sprawling, six\u0002story home in the Nyori Palisades. Navasi&rsquo;s mother had designs on her canny-but-headstrong daughter inheriting the family&rsquo;s business. Her father had visions of a queenly young woman sitting in silk among the station&rsquo;s most prominent socialites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Navasi wanted neither. A quip on her lips, she eschewed glitzy playdates and family soirees in favor of zipping through Absalom Station&rsquo;s streets with her best friends, the children of the household employees. She&rsquo;d take the rush of riding a screaming hovercycle over the pompous sniggering of the wealthy any day of the week.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As she befriended more and more stationers from less privileged walks of life, Navasi&rsquo;s irritation with her parents and their deliberate aloofness from the rest of society turned into outright disgust. The inequities of Absalom Station, where the rich lived in fortified enclaves and the poor lived in little more than metal boxes, pained her. She began to dream of a fairy-tale life in which she could steal the affluent&rsquo;s unearned wealth and give it to those truly in need, and idolized the Free Captains of the Diaspora&mdash;pirates living by their own rules. Navasi could only imagine the fun she&rsquo;d have with such freedom&mdash;and the good she&rsquo;d do, of course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Navasi sat in her plush quarters, staring at the gold-fibered holo-gown that was to be her debut dress. Two choices stood before her: She could don that false uniform, attend the gala, and accept her mother&rsquo;s gift of an executive position in the family company. Or she could leave.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It took less than an hour for Navasi to slip out of the manor and stow away on a ship bound for the Diaspora.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Navasi arrived on Broken Rock with a pocketful of stolen credsticks and a gleam in her eye. She quickly signed up as a &ldquo;procurement specialist&rdquo; with a contracting firm called the Sixth Finger&mdash;little more than a starfaring thieves&rsquo; guild&mdash;ready to use her new position to steal from exploitative corporations and make herself a hero to those in need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reality of life in a pirate enclave hit her like a meteorite. Having quickly blown through her money, and too stubborn to return home in shame, Navasi found she no longer had a choice in which jobs she took. Under the guildrunners&rsquo; threats, she roughed up innocents, stole from the less fortunate, and worse. Though she never completely lost her egalitarian beliefs, she hardly recognized the naive idealist she&rsquo;d once been. A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she&rsquo;d taken for granted, and taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first needed to take care of herself. That, at least, she was good at, and she quickly gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and facewoman around, spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Navasi found that the wealth from her scores brought little joy without friends to share it with, and she took comfort in the hardscrabble survivalists and secretly softhearted rogues she recruited to her crews. Yet it was in one particular woman that Navasi truly found herself again. Purple-haired and tattooed, with eyes like blue supergiants, the newcomer was outspoken against those in power. She bucked the pirates&rsquo; authority and operated alone, pulling the sorts of righteous jobs Navasi had once dreamed of. She was the bravest, most exciting woman Navasi had ever met, and the two quickly became inseparable. That all came crashing down the day the Sixth Finger arranged to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. To the gang&rsquo;s leaders, the ship&rsquo;s mission&mdash; aiding refugees of a war-torn star system&mdash;was inconsequential compared to the valuable drugs in its cargo bays. Navasi&rsquo;s objections were overruled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was the final straw. Together, Navasi and her partner formulated a plan, alerting the medship to the imminent heist and carefully sabotaging the fighters the gang had designated for the assault. It all might have gone unnoticed, had the gang&rsquo;s resident technomancer not decided to check the security cams one final time. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi and her partner were pinned down, their backs to the sole spaceworthy ship&mdash;a single-seat fighter with enough life support for only one of them. Unwilling to leave her companion, Navasi prepared for them to go out in a blaze of glory&mdash;only to have her partner shove her into the cockpit and slam the canopy. As Navasi scrabbled with the latch, the other woman winked, pulled the pins on her grenades, and sprinted straight at their ambushers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>he pirate she&rsquo;d become. As she made her way back to Absalom Station, knowing that neither the Sixth Finger nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook her previous lives. Abandoning her old identity, she took the name of her fallen love&mdash;Navasi&mdash;and swore that henceforth she&rsquo;d carry on the fight they&rsquo;d started together, stealing only from those who deserved it. Knowing she&rsquo;d need a new appearance as well, she continued borrowing from her partner, dyeing her jet-black hair purple and adding a single blue contact lens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Navasi has built a reputation&mdash;perhaps more than is wise for a woman with a price on her head&mdash;as a talented freelance captain, putting together crews for adventures ranging from planetary scouting and private security to her old talent for &ldquo;procurement,&rdquo; though she&rsquo;s careful about what jobs she and her friends take on. Navasi still believes in freedom for all, spreading the wealth, and taking plutocrats down a peg&mdash;but she also knows the value of earning credits, and takes pride in taking care of herself and her crew (though she still has a sometimes inconvenient tendency to empty her pockets for those in need). As a scoundrel and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance, as that&rsquo;s when you truly know who your friends are. Above all, she knows to always look beneath the surface, for like Navasi herself, nothing is ever quite what it seems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Convincing Liar (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;When Navasi attempts a Bluff check, she can choose to not add her expertise die until after she sees the result of her d20. Once she sees the result of her d20, she can either roll and add her expertise die normally or reroll the d20 and take the better of the two d20 results (but not add her expertise die).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision&nbsp;</strong>Navasi can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Diversion&nbsp;</strong>When Navasi successfully uses Bluff to create a distraction, she can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide herself). She can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but she takes a &ndash;5 penalty to her Bluff check for every ally after the first, and on a failed check, no ally can attempt to hide.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Expertise (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;If Navasi has at least 1 Resolve Point remaining when she attempts a Bluff or Sense Motive check, she can roll 1d6 and add it to the result as an insight bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Get &rsquo;Em (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As a move action, Navasi selects one foe within 60 feet that she can see or hear, and that can see or hear her. Navasi and her allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls against that foe until the end of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Feint&nbsp;</strong>As a move action, Navasi can attempt a Bluff check against a single opponent (DC = either 10 + her opponent&rsquo;s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the opponent&rsquo;s CR, whichever is greater) to cause that opponent to be flat-footed for the next attack she makes against it before the end of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Inspiring Boost (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As a standard action, Navasi can signal an ally who has taken damage since Navasi&rsquo;s last turn. The ally must be able to see and hear her and be within 30 feet. The ally gains 11 Stamina Points, up to the ally&rsquo;s normal maximum. Navasi cannot target that ally with this ability again until that ally takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Watch Out (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;When a foe makes a ranged attack against an ally within 60 feet of Navasi, she can warn the ally as a reaction. The ally can use a reaction to gain a +4 bonus to AC against that single attack and then falls prone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Anarchic Flame Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This chaos-aligned magic weapon creates a jet of flame that targets all creatures in a 20-foot line. Make a single attack roll and compare it to the EAC of all targets. Roll damage only once; each target hit takes that amount. This weapon bypasses the energy resistance of lawful outsiders and dragons. It can be fired five times before its petrol tank needs to be refilled or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Basic Medkit</strong>&nbsp;This basic medkit allows Navasi to attempt DC 25 Medicine checks to treat deadly wounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Computer, Tier 2&nbsp;</strong>This computer has the artificial personality, miniaturization to L bulk, and self-charging upgrades. It can receive commands and give information verbally. The computer&rsquo;s artificial personality is advanced enough to attempt Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks with a +4 bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>D-Suit I</strong>&nbsp;While wearing this armor, Navasi can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum or other harsh environments for up to 5 days. Its infrared sensors upgrade gives Navasi darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashlight</strong>&nbsp;Navasi&rsquo;s flashlight increases the light level by one step in a 20-foot cone. It can be used for 10 hours before its battery needs to be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong>&nbsp;Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 Hit Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch</strong>&nbsp;Navasi can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat poison task.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Smoke Grenade</strong>&nbsp;This creates a 20-foot radius of smoke that lasts 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Stickybomb Grenade I&nbsp;</strong>Any creature hit by this grenade that fails a DC 12 Reflex save gains the entangled condition until it escapes as a move action with a successful DC 13 Acrobatics or DC 18 Strength check or until 2d4 rounds pass.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This weapon can be fired nine times before it must be reloaded.&nbsp;</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["akiton","aklo","common","kasatha","shirren","vercite","vesk","ysoki"]},"senses":"Darkvision 60ft","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Navasi L4","actorId":"6KLsgqFTDDlttZLu","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/iconics/Envoy -

Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness.

Choose two additional skills and add them to your list of class skills. </span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7ilyZdE0yZi2F3SQ]{Solar Manifestation (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br><br>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use.

They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens&mdash;races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they&rsquo;re ready to write all @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>120-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>25 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>Desert Stride</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>Four-Armed</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment.

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level. <br><br>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level.

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"

If Altronus has 1 or 2 points in a mode, he is attuned to that mode. If he has 3 points in a mode, he is fully attuned to that mode.

Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls&mdash;a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Androids are biomechanical constructs created in technological cr&egrave;ches called foundries. While the first androids are believed to have been mostly biological, difficult to distinguish from the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} they lived among, modern designs are more varied, and many favor metal skeletons and processors that support synthetic organs and living flesh. Nearly all androids feature a humanoid body shape and tattoo-like circuits that glow through their skin when operating at full power, but beyond this commonality, variations in physical appearance reflect an android&rsquo;s design, role, and personality. Some take pains to blend into @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} society, while others deliberately display their mechanical nature. Though some androids are constructed or customize themselves to look like other races, such models are relatively rare. Due to their biological components, androids need to eat and sleep, but as constructed beings they do not reproduce in the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} fashion and have no biological need for gender&mdash;some identify strongly as male or female, while others shift fluidly or ignore it altogether, and still others actively reject it on philosophical grounds as a relic of their former slavery.</p>\n<p>Though android bodies are assembled using tiny machines called nanites, their complex nervous systems attract and integrate souls in the same way organic creatures do. Most androids are fully grown at the time of their birth, and can technically live forever through constant repair, though most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so to allow new souls to inhabit them&mdash;a process called renewal that&rsquo;s viewed more as procreation than suicide.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Android technology in the Pact Worlds is generally believed to have developed on Golarion in the time before the Gap, though there are strong indications that the first androids there were actually travelers from a distant star system. In the modern era, various corporations throughout the Pact Worlds system unraveled the secret to android creation and began massproducing androids as cheap, skilled labor perfect for hazardous work. This practice lasted until about 150 years ago, when the Thyst Rebellion and subsequent android revolts across the system, combined with the now legendary speech known as &ldquo;The Automaton&rsquo;s Polemic&rdquo; by android revolutionary Serphaeus-6, led governments system-wide to officially recognize all androids as independent citizens. This ruling, however, has not completely stopped unscrupulous corporations in less regulated parts of the system from crafting illegal android slaves or forcing newborn androids to &ldquo;work off&rdquo; the expense of their creation. Though androids can be found anywhere in the Pact Worlds, many gravitate toward cosmopolitan @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the machine cities of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}, and the freedom of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Android society tends to be insular. While androids are treated equitably in most settlements, especially @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, many androids have not forgotten their people&rsquo;s bondage and remain keenly aware of prejudice from other races based on their &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; origin or jealousy over the androids&rsquo; freedom from aging. This leads most androids to feel a sense of kinship with others of their kind and to go out of their way to help each other, though they may also bond with members of other races who treat them well. Despite popular belief, androids&rsquo; impressive deductive reasoning abilities do not preclude sentiment, and most androids feel emotions keenly&mdash;they simply don&rsquo;t always express them well, and different individuals may have trouble processing and communicating particular feelings. The average android alignment is a practical neutrality; they are focused on their own welfare and that of their friends.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Often cautious around strangers, androids have the most strained relationship with humanity, which built them in its image and remains their most frequent oppressor. They feel closest to shirrens, who also know what it is to be enslaved and misunderstood, and respect kasathas&rsquo; self-sufficiency. They generally dislike @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, whom they see as slavers, and only grudgingly tolerate ysoki&rsquo;s antics.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Androids adventure for many reasons: to earn a living, trace the origins of their race, or rescue androids and other creatures from servitude. Their quick thinking under fire makes them natural operatives and soldiers, while their affinity for machines makes them excellent mechanics and technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>&mdash;<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>See Android entry</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Androids are Medium humanoids with the android subtype.</p>\n<h2>Constructed</h2>\n<p>For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. In addition, androids do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Exceptional Vision</h2>\n<p>Androids have darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. See pages 263&ndash;264 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Flat Affect</h2>\n<p>Androids find emotions confusing and keep them bottled up. They take a &ndash;2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, but the DCs of Sense Motive checks attempted against them increase by 2.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade Slot</h2>\n<p>Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Most androids have the standard android racial traits detailed in the&nbsp;Core Rulebook, but individuals might have unique abilities, represented by the following alternate racial traits.</p>\n<h2>Easily Augmented</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />As artificial creatures, androids are compatible with a wide array of cybernetics. Androids who have this racial trait can install one additional cybernetic augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Impersonation Matrix</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Although most androids stand out as artificial beings, some have intricate personality matrices and physical alterations that downplay their constructed nature. Androids who have this alternate racial trait don&rsquo;t take any penalty to Disguise checks to change their appearance to a creature of a different race or type if they are disguising themselves as a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}. If the android also has the xenometric android alternate racial trait (see page 17), this benefit instead applies to Disguise checks to change appearance to that of the race chosen along with the xenometric android alternate racial trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces the +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep from the constructed trait. The android retains all the other features of the constructed trait.</p>\n<h2>Infosphere Integration</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />The artificial brain an android possesses can allow better compatibility with infospheres and direct downloads of information. An android with this trait has a built-in comm unit that can be accessed without needing to use their hands. Once per day, whenever the android takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, they can choose one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill. The chosen skill becomes a class skill for them, and they gain Skill Focus as a bonus feat with that skill. This decision lasts until the next time the android uses this trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces exceptional vision.</p>\n<h2>Multilingual</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />New languages are easy for some androids to learn. An android with this racial trait knows four additional languages at 1st level. In addition, whenever such an android invests a skill rank into Culture, they learn two new languages instead of one.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Nanite Upgrade</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Specialized nanites maintain an android body, but they can be upgraded to perform additional tasks. Androids who have this racial trait gain Nanite integration as a bonus feat, ignoring the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Xenometric Android</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Although most androids are manufactured to resemble @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, those crafted in the likenesses of other species exist. Such &ldquo;xenometrics&rdquo; possess abilities that mirror those of other races, sometimes even using hybrid tech to duplicate magic abilities.</p>\n<p>An android with this trait selects one of the species detailed in the paragraphs below. This choice cannot be changed. In addition to possessing physical features resembling those of the chosen species, the android&rsquo;s size category and reach changes to match the chosen race. In addition, xenometric androids gain some of the chosen species&rsquo; racial traits, which are noted in parentheses next to the race&rsquo;s name; these count as racial traits for the purposes of prerequisites. If a gained racial trait determines land speed, the android uses the speed as defined by that racial trait instead of that of the android. If the chosen species has a different type than humanoid, the xenometric android&rsquo;s type changes to match.</p>\n<p>Starfinder Core Rulebook options are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf} (darkvision, slow but steady), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf} (elven immunities, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} (@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} magic, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf} (adaptability, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} (darkvision, intimidating, self-sufficient), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling} (keen senses, sneaky, sure-footed), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} (four-armed, natural grace), lashunta (lashunta magic, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} (blindsense, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} (low-light vision, natural weapons), and ysoki (cheek pouches, darkvision).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive options are dragonkin (draconic immunities, flight), formian (limited telepathy, natural weapons), haan (firespray, slow fall), kalo (kalo movement, kalo vision), maraquoi (blindsense, prehensile tail), nuar (natural weapons, swift), verthani (skill focus, skin mimic), and wrikreechee (snag, wrikreechee movement).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive 2 options are hobgoblin (fearsome, sneaky), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} (fierce survivalist, orc ferocity), pahtra (nimble, talented), and vlaka (cold resistance, perceptive).</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Pact Worlds option is the strix (nightborn, strix mobility).</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot and exceptional vision.</p>"},"hp":{"min":1,"value":4},"modifiers":[{"_id":"3e41133e-52af-41f8-bc3c-43a97e2f98e2","name":"Constructed","type":"racial","condition":"","effectType":"saves","enabled":false,"max":2,"modifier":"2","modifierType":"formula","notes":"For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).

Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information on augmentations, see Chapter 7: Equipment. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.<br><br>If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear.

Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.<br><br>You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your class level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once.

This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.lOqPFn93aueiBQst]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AiYxJza4CVXPRjFz]{Remote Hack (Ex) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet.

Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers.<br><br>You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles.

To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor’s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Damaged Ship</strong>: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship’s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9H5hz8bMW0i0wz2x]{Override (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UZMGMjpAwhGZNurI]{Coordinated Assault (Ex) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NtHGqPauPZauV7rc]{Advanced Rig (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br><br>In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vaV8mCJdunfbWwQL]{Control Net (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.clTAGasLWOe1pr4D]{Ghost in the Machine (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>When using your override class feature to affect an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GLFInMDKp2fLRpsG]{Superior Rig (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures.

This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon.

Yet through wit and technological prowess, they&rsquo;ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Ranging from 3 to 4 feet tall, ysoki resemble humanoid rats who walk upright, complete with fur, long incisors, constantly twitching noses, and partially prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity. Their small, dexterous hands are perfect for working on delicate electronics, and their keen noses often allow them to identify complex chemicals by smell. Male and female ysoki are difficult for other races to tell apart, as they have similar body types and favor similar fashions.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>While the term &ldquo;ysoki&rdquo; originates from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}, where the race has long been a vibrant and respected culture, populations of ratfolk (as they&rsquo;re sometimes called) existed on several worlds for millennia before spaceflight became common. Whether these different populations were examples of convergent evolution or they shared a common ancestor is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but today most of these cultures now identify as part of the overarching ysoki race. This is due partially to the wide variation in ysoki heredity, which makes ethnicity (and often even immediate family connections) almost impossible to determine by sight or genetics, but even more so to the fact that ysoki have done more than any other ratfolk group to demand and maintain the respect of larger races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Ysoki society is chaotic and freewheeling, and a typical warren is full of half-finished projects and multiple ysoki talking over each other. Regardless of their role in society, nearly all ysoki hold a deep and abiding love for technology and gadgets, whether it be an engineer&rsquo;s love of taking machines apart or a soldier&rsquo;s appreciation for her armor&rsquo;s construction. While they traditionally take on roles and societal niches other races view as unpleasant, acting as junkers or squeezing through the innards of starships, this is due not to a lack of pride, but rather an abundance thereof&mdash;ysoki are so sure of their own worth that living in subpar conditions doesn&rsquo;t shame them. Larger races&rsquo; tendency to underestimate or pick on ysoki has left them fiercely loyal to their friends and families&mdash;both ysoki and otherwise&mdash;and a ysoki presented with a gross injustice often feels the need to fling himself teeth-first at the problem, consequences be damned. As a result, the most common ysoki alignment is chaotic good, though they can easily be tugged toward the evil alignments by loyalty or a need to strike back at perceived oppression (or even simple disrespect).</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Friendly and talented, ysoki integrate easily into most civilized societies, sometimes in all-ysoki neighborhoods and other times living side by side with alien cultures. The large size of ysoki families and their tendency to travel also means that a ysoki on a Pact World is shockingly likely to have a cousin or other contact in just about any major settlement. Of the major races, ysoki get along best with lashuntas, with whom they&rsquo;ve traded for millennia, though they appreciate humanity&rsquo;s pluck and shirrens&rsquo; devotion to community, even if the latter are a little too calm for ysoki tastes. They identify with androids&rsquo; defiance in the face of prejudice, but they find kasathas too aloof and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} too obsessed with displaying dominance. Regardless of others&rsquo; races, ysoki pride themselves on being quick judges of character, and members of many other races have been surprised to find a ysoki fighting on their behalf after no more than a conversation in a crowded bar. Quick to rile and quick to forgive, fond of laughing at misfortune (both their own and others&rsquo;), ysoki can sometimes be exhausting, but they are rarely boring.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Though ysoki form strong bonds with their friends and families, these connections are as likely to take them off-world as to keep them at home. Many curious young ysoki sign on with starship crews to see the universe or find their fortunes, and soon adopt their shipmates as a second family. Their natural aptitude with machines most often leads ysoki to become mechanics and technomancers, but they also enjoy the gloriously complicated weaponry employed by operatives and soldiers, and many appreciate the quick-witted patter of envoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Str<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>3-4 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>60-100 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>10 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>60+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are Small humanoids with the ysoki subtype.</p>\n<h2>Cheek Pouches</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can see up to 60 feet in the dark. See page 263 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Moxie</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are scrappy and nimble even when the odds are against them. A ysoki can stand from prone as a swift action.

The detonator can be set to ignite its payload with the simple press of a button (no action), a four-digit command code (a move action), or a complex input method, such as scanning your retina or thumbprint (a full action). You choose the triggering method when setting the detonator. A detonator detonates its payload only if it is within 500 feet, but some detonators can make use of signal-boosting technologies at the risk of becoming vulnerable to countermeasures like signal jammers and other effects.

In his spare time, he constructed the first iterations of what would become his drone companion, Scout, using spare parts he scrounged from junk heaps and alleys. One early morning as he hunted for scraps he could fashion into an actuator, he was winged in a passing firefight waged between a shobhad bounty hunterand her human quarry. Ignoring the pain, Quig dropped the hunk of metal he was holding and chased after the fracas, arriving in time to see the bounty hunter slap the fugitive into restraints. Flushed with adrenaline, Quig realized that this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>Quig immediately left home and signed on as a caravan guard, and it was in the course of his new career that he ran into Dhareen the Vise, the same shobhad bounty hunter who inadvertently set him on his life&rsquo;s path. After hiring Dhareen to help him take revenge on some drone-stealing thugs, Quig convinced Dhareen to let him be her apprentice. The ysoki learned much from the gruff shobhad over the next year, and though they often butted heads over methods, the two enjoyed a relationship of mutual respect. When Dhareen eventually completed a job large enough to let her retire, Quig (and Scout) continued on without her.</p>\n<p>Quig is personable and outgoing&mdash;often chattier than his comrades would like&mdash;and his constant traveling has left him with contacts across the Pact Worlds. He prides himself on being a good judge of character, and while he&rsquo;s savvy enough to withhold actual trust until it&rsquo;s been earned, he&rsquo;s not above throwing himself into a fight on behalf of a near-stranger. Though fully capable of working alone, he tends to get bored easily without people to talk to, and thus prefers to sign on with teams of adventurers, where he can act as the group&rsquo;s resident tracker and starship engineer. While he still keeps in touch with his family, he doesn&rsquo;t speak about his hometown much, as he&rsquo;s a bit embarrassed by his unglamorous upbringing-when he does mention it, it is with a liberal helping of humor. He&rsquo;s a fan of both taking minor trophies from previous jobs and scavenging spare parts that he&rsquo;s positive may come in handy someday, inevitably turning his cabin into a riotous nest of cherished junk.</p>\n<p>Quig&rsquo;s closest companion is his drone, Scout, and he spends the majority of his downtime puttering about in the robot&rsquo;s systems. He often talks to Scout as way of thinking out loud or voicing his innermost thoughts, attributing them to the drone in a way that can make him seem a bit unbalanced to those who don&rsquo;t know him well. (And in truth, sometimes to those who do.) When he&rsquo;s captured a bounty and is feeling particularly mischievous, he often pretends to consult with the robot about the person&rsquo;s fate, ultimately claiming that he sympathizes and would like to let the target go, but &ldquo;the robot says otherwise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence </strong>Quig has a flying drone he constructed himself. It acts after Quig&rsquo;s turn each round. If Quig takes no actions to control the drone, it can take only a standard action to attack or a move action to move up to its speed. If Quig takes a move action to control it, the drone can take a standard and move action. If Quig takes a move and swift action to control his drone, it can take a standard, move, and swift action, or a full action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Barricade&nbsp;</strong>As a move action, Quig can stack and reinforce objects too small to provide cover normally into a single adjacent square of partial cover. (The GM can rule that particularly barren areas lack the material needed to create a barricade.) If built in a square that already provided partial cover, the barricade instead provides cover. The barricade has hardness 9 and 9 Hit Points. If the barricade or a creature adjacent to it is hit by an attack, the barricade collapses 1d4 rounds later even if it has not yet been destroyed by damage. Normally there is not enough spare material to build a second barricade in the same square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bypass </strong>Quig gains a +1 bonus to Computers and Engineering checks. This has been added to his skill bonuses above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cheek Pouches </strong>Quig can keep up to 1 cubic foot of items, weighing up to 1 bulk, in his cheek pouches. He can transfer a single item between his hand and a cheek pouch as a swift action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Custom Rig </strong>Quig has a customized handheld toolkit he uses to hack systems and items. It functions as the appropriate tool for any Computers or Engineering checks he attempts. If it&rsquo;s destroyed, he can build a new custom rig from any technological toolkit with 1 hour of work.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision </strong>Quig can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.Moxie Quig can stand from prone as a swift action. When off-kilter, he does not take the normal penalties for that condition and is not flat-footed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Energy Shield</strong> As a standard action, Quig can use his custom rig to grant himself an energy shield. It gives him 7 temporary Hit Points and lasts for 4 minutes or until its Hit Points are depleted. Once he has used it, he can&rsquo;t activate it again until he takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Moxie </strong>Quig can stand from prone as a swift action. When off-kilter, he does not take the normal penalties for that condition and is not flat-footed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overcharge</strong> As a standard action, Quig can use his custom rig to overcharge and fire an energy weapon (or melee weapon with the powered special property) in his possession, or as a move action he can overcharge a touched weapon (which is then overcharged for its next attack made before the end of Quig&rsquo;s next turn). An overcharged weapon&rsquo;s attack deals an additional 1d6 damage and uses three times as many charges as a typical attack with the weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overload </strong>As a standard action, Quig can overload an adjacent technological item, such as a powered weapon or armor upgrade (though not a creature, or an object larger than Medium size). The item does not function for 1 round. If the item is in a foe&rsquo;s possession, that creature can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. Once a device is overloaded, a static charge prevents the object from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Theme Knowledge </strong>Quig can select a specific sentient creature that he can identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be his mark. He reduces the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks by 5 to recall knowledge about his mark, as well as about law-enforcement individuals and practices. If he knows his mark by an alias, he can recall only knowledge associated with that alias.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> Quig gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Club </strong>This archaic weapon deals 5 less damage to foes unless they are unarmored or in archaic armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Defrex </strong>Hide While wearing this armor, Quig can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Detonator </strong>A detonator can be wired to an explosive in 1 minute, and set to detonate the explosive within 500 feet with the push of a button (no action if done on Quig&rsquo;s turn, or a reaction), a command code (a move action) or a complex action such as a retinal scan (a full action). The detonator can be used 5 times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Explosives </strong>Quig has a number of explosives designed to work with his detonator. These have the some cost, weight, and effect as grenades, but must be activated with a detonator rather than thrown. He has two stickybomb II explosives (explode [15 ft., entangled 2d4 rounds, DC 13]), two flash I explosives (explode [5 ft., blinded 1d4 rounds, DC 12]), and one incendiary I explosive (explode [5 ft., 1d6 F plus 1d4 burn, DC 12).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing </strong>Drinking this serum restores 1d8 HP.<br />Second Skin While wearing this armor, Quig can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Ampoule of Mending</strong> Quig can inject this spell ampoule into Scout (or another construct) to restore 1d4 Hit Points to it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol </strong>This weapon shoots physical bullets and can be fired nine times before it needs to be reloaded. Quig has 30 rounds of small arm ammunition, which can reload this or Scout&rsquo;s pistol.</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":null,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":4,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":41,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["akiton","brethedan","common","kasatha","shirren","ysoki"]},"senses":"Darkvision 60ft","size":"small","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Quig L4","actorId":"CGiCnOHgdl3Q8FYT","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/iconics/Mechanic - Quig.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens&mdash;races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they&rsquo;re ready to write all @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>120-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>25 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>Desert Stride</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>Four-Armed</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br><br>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br><br>If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2BjD4ocSE0BL5DcN]{Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.IPDN3VDLTrrMFE2g]{Injection Expert (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect. At 2nd level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with these weapons. At 9th level, that bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3.<br><br>When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When you fire a weapon with the injection special property and you have multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, you choose which type of ammunition you fire when you attempt the attack.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.aWxj3kjbSduZkm9j]{Primary Field Of Study (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty. Choose your primary field of study upon taking your first level in biohacker—once made, this choice cannot be changed. A field of study grants you a unique booster and inhibitor, many of which work only on living creatures (not objects or creatures with the unliving universal creature rule) and have special properties and descriptors explained in their entries. At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.effKY7m8EX1NnZWX]{Scientific Method (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have an innate mental gift, and a special way of approaching problems that lets you surpass normal researchers and scholars. If your key ability score is Intelligence, you have a studious mind. If your key ability score is Wisdom, you have an instinctive mind. Your scientific method affects your spark of ingenuity class feature (see below), and may impact how some other class features function, as noted in those abilities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rpaon3jF3nCe5eP9]{Theorem (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you devise theories about the way the universe works. Some theorems you can apply to yourself, altering your physiological structure to gain specific benefits, while others require the use of your custom microlab or other equipment or add additional options for your biohacks.<br><br>You learn your first theorem at 2nd level, and you gain an additional theorem every 2 levels thereafter. If a theorem allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. If a theorem requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn a theorem more than once. Once you learn a theorem, that choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Sg8hjAB2QYWFrT0X]{Spark Of Ingenuity (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Possible permutations and offshoots of your formulas constantly run through your mind. Once per day, you can alter one of your biohacks to work in a different way, determined by your scientific method. You can do this one additional time per day at 9th level and at 15th level.<br><br>If you are a studious biohacker, you can expend two uses of your biohack ability to combine the effect of two basic or minor biohacks (or one of each) into a single effect. This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.<br><br>If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster’s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the off-target condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, deafened, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, you can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of your inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor’s duration.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.hNCEVQicM9RrOv6J]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with. For weapons you have gained proficiency with only through the injection expert class feature, rather than the normal Weapon Specialization benefit, you instead add half your character level to damage you deal with those weapons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.kqK4E3QfsnbIqHtB]{Secondary Field Of Study (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You choose a secondary field of study, which must be different from your primary field of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 11th level, you gain the breakthrough for your secondary field of study. When discussing your eduction, your secondary field of study is often referred to as your “minor.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.fBSG6tVqpRJ6ssTe]{Tertiary Field Of Study (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>You choose a third field of study, which must be different from your primary and secondary fields of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 17th level, you gain the breakthrough for your tertiary field of study.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.bM6uQky5xcLUmfSJ]{Resolve Analysis (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Whenever you use your spark of ingenuity class feature, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.cWnerlKxauezz4Sa]{Superserum (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; At 20th level, you have developed the formula for a superserum that can create powerful changes in a target. You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast raise dead or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage. The target takes 17d10 points of damage and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier), the damage is halved, and the target is instead only fatigued for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Relieve the target of debilitating conditions. Choose one set of ability scores: mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) or physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The target is healed of all ability damage to the chosen set of ability scores, and all ability drain from these ability scores is removed. Regardless of which set of scores you choose, the superserum also eliminates any ongoing confusion, fear, and insanity effects; any mental afflictions that could be removed with dispel magic; and any diseases that use the mental disease track. It removes any effects magically altering the target’s memory—even instantaneous effects—and can restore the target’s memory to perfect clarity.</li>\n</ul>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":false,"kas":"int","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"COM, p. 40","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"will":"slow"}},{"_id":"JPJUEsIwuPARSzpr","name":"Shock grenade I","type":"weapon","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/weapons/shock-grenade.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","ability":"str","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"rwak","activation":{"type":"action","condition":"","cost":1},"area":{"effect":"burst","shape":"sphere","units":"ft","value":15},"attackBonus":0,"attributes":{"ac":{"value":"5"},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":"7"},"hp":{"max":"18","value":18},"size":"medium","sturdy":true},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","capacity":{"max":1,"value":1},"chatFlavor":"","container":{"contents":[],"isOpen":true,"storage":[{"type":"slot","acceptsType":["fusion"],"affectsEncumbrance":true,"amount":1,"subtype":"fusion","weightProperty":"level"}]},"critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[{"formula":"1d8","operator":"","types":{"electricity":true}}]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">A shock grenade releases a pulse of electrical energy on impact.&nbsp;</span></p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":""},"equippable":false,"equipped":true,"formula":"","identified":true,"isActive":null,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":50,"proficient":true,"properties":{"aeon":false,"amm":false,"analog":false,"antibiological":false,"archaic":false,"aurora":false,"automatic":false,"blast":false,"block":false,"boost":false,"breach":false,"breakdown":false,"bright":false,"cluster":false,"conceal":false,"deconstruct":false,"deflect":false,"disarm":false,"double":false,"drainCharge":false,"echo":false,"entangle":false,"explode":true,"extinguish":false,"feint":false,"fiery":false,"firstArc":false,"flexibleLine":false,"force":false,"freeHands":false,"fueled":false,"grapple":false,"gravitation":false,"guided":false,"harrying":false,"holyWater":false,"hybrid":false,"ignite":false,"indirect":false,"injection":false,"integrated":false,"line":false,"living":false,"lockdown":false,"mind-affecting":false,"mine":false,"mire":false,"modal":false,"necrotic":false,"nonlethal":false,"one":true,"operative":false,"penetrating":false,"polarize":false,"polymorphic":false,"powered":false,"professional":false,"punchGun":false,"qreload":false,"radioactive":false,"reach":false,"recall":false,"regrowth":false,"relic":false,"reposition":false,"shape":false,"shells":false,"shield":false,"sniper":false,"stun":false,"subtle":false,"sunder":false,"swarm":false,"tail":false,"teleportive":false,"thought":false,"throttle":false,"thrown":true,"trip":false,"two":false,"unbalancing":false,"underwater":false,"unwieldy":false,"variantBoost":false,"wideLine":false},"quantity":2,"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"ft","value":20},"save":{"type":"reflex","dc":"10+floor(@item.level/2)+@abilities.dex.mod","descriptor":"half"},"source":"CRB pg. 177","special":"","target":{"type":"","value":""},"usage":{"per":"shot","value":1},"uses":{"max":1,"per":"charges","value":1},"weaponCategory":"shock","weaponType":"grenade"}},{"_id":"DOSFiFdGik608u02","name":"Serum of Healing, Mk 1","type":"consumable","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/magic%20items/serum-of-healing.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","ability":"","actionType":"heal","activation":{"type":"action","condition":"","cost":1},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"none","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"attributes":{"ac":{"value":""},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":""},"hp":{"max":"","value":6},"size":"medium","sturdy":false},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","chatFlavor":"","consumableType":"serum","container":{"contents":[],"isOpen":true,"storage":[{"type":"slot","acceptsType":["spell"],"affectsEncumbrance":false,"amount":0,"subtype":"spellSlot","weightProperty":"bulk"}]},"critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[{"formula":"1d8","operator":"","types":{"healing":true}}]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl11_LabelName\">This vial of medical serum quickly sets bones and repairs other physical damage.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned.

You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br><br>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Biohacker","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"3Ix7Qj7s2J0JAZCb","name":"Primary Field Of Study (Ex)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":400000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.PSHcGB4UFgMSiF4V]{Biohacker}</p>\n<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty.

She can use it to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks, described below.</p>\n<p>Her custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer (granting a +4 bonus on Engineering, Mysticism, and Physical Science checks to identify unknown drugs, medicinals, poisons, and other chemical substances). As long as she has her custom microlab, as a move action she can target a creature within 60 feet in her line of sight and attempt a special skill check to identify it as though her die roll were a 20, using Life Science for a living creature or Physical Science for an unliving one, with the check&rsquo;s DC determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity (page 133 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook).</p>\n<p>Barsala can also attune her custom microlab to 6 individual creatures. This takes 10 minutes, which she can combine with the time needed to prepare her biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If she attunes her microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond her maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be reattuned. Under some circumstances, Barsala can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.</p>\n<p>If her custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, Barsala can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. She can have only one custom microlab at a time. If she creates a new one, her old microlab functions as a normal item of whatever type she made it from.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Biohacks (Ex)</strong> Barsala can use biohacks to boost her allies or inhibit her foes. Her biohacks produce their effects only when she injects a creature with them (see below), and only she knows how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves Barsala&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until she picks it up again.</p>\n<p>Barsala can deliver any biohack she creates with any attack from an injection weapon. She must decide to use a biohack prior to the attack roll and specify which effect she&rsquo;s using. She applies the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. She does not need to preload her weapon with biohacks. If she makes a ranged attack and misses, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If Barsala&rsquo;s attack with a biohack hits but deals no damage, the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, Barsala can remove or change which biohack she&rsquo;s using as part of her next attack without spending any additional action.</p>\n<p>She can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (a level 1 consumable basic melee weapon from her custom microlab) that she can wield in one hand. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, Barsala must hit the creature with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.</p>\n<p>Barsala can inject a biohack into a willing or unconscious creature (or herself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within her reach. She can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally she has attuned her custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within 60 feet. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p>The materials Barsala uses to create biohacks are inert until she activates them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks she knows. Each day after she has rested for 8 hours, Barsala can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create 4 biohacks, and this is the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; Barsala doesn&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks she&rsquo;s creating until performing the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in her possession. Barsala can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost. Whenever she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, Barsala can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those she has used, up to her maximum.</p>\n<p>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. Barsala knows the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by her primary field of study (see below).</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Booster </span></em>- A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for 3 rounds unless it states otherwise. When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Inhibitor </span></em>- A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature&rsquo;s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for 6 rounds unless it states otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s DR by 5.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s resistance to one type of energy (her choice) by 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of Barsala&rsquo;s basic inhibitors at a time, though it can be affected by multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If Barsala affects a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still affecting it, the effects of the previous inhibitor immediately end.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minor Biohacks - </span></em>Barsala can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and she can add them to any attack she makes with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. She doesn&rsquo;t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minor Booster: </strong>Using a minor booster biohack allows Barsala to attempt to administer first aid with a Medicine check on targets within 60 feet of her microlab. This doesn&rsquo;t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack, and it doesn&rsquo;t have the duration of normal biohacks.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Minor Inhibitor: </strong>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance; the target takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls for 6 rounds.<hr /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Field of Study, Genetics (Ex) Barsala has selected the genetics field of study, granting her access to a unique booster and inhibitor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Booster </span></em>- Barsala temporarily boosts a living creature to improve the acuity of its hearing, granting the subject the benefits of blindsense (sound) with a range of 60 feet. If the creature already has blindsense, it instead gains the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. This benefit lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inhibitor </span></em>- Barsala delivers a DNA-twisting or material-altering chemical nanite compound into a creature&rsquo;s body, imparting vulnerability to one type of energy (her choice). If the creature is immune to that energy type, this inhibitor temporarily removes that immunity and gives the creature resistance 20 to that type of energy. If the creature has resistance to that energy type, this effect instead reduces its resistance by 10 (minimum 0). This biohack does not remove a creature&rsquo;s resistance or immunity to natural hazards or environments, only to damage from energy attacks, spells, and other abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Injection Expert (Ex) Barsala is proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property from a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Barsala hits an ally with an injection weapon, she can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When she fires a weapon with the injection special property and has multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, she chooses which type of ammunition she fires when she makes the attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Barsala gains a +4 bonus to her Armor Class against attacks of opportunity that she provokes by leaving a threatened square.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Second Skin</strong> While wearing this armor, Barsala can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tactical Needler Pistol This weapon can be fired 8 times before it needs to be reloaded.

Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls&mdash;a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Androids are biomechanical constructs created in technological cr&egrave;ches called foundries. While the first androids are believed to have been mostly biological, difficult to distinguish from the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} they lived among, modern designs are more varied, and many favor metal skeletons and processors that support synthetic organs and living flesh. Nearly all androids feature a humanoid body shape and tattoo-like circuits that glow through their skin when operating at full power, but beyond this commonality, variations in physical appearance reflect an android&rsquo;s design, role, and personality. Some take pains to blend into @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} society, while others deliberately display their mechanical nature. Though some androids are constructed or customize themselves to look like other races, such models are relatively rare. Due to their biological components, androids need to eat and sleep, but as constructed beings they do not reproduce in the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} fashion and have no biological need for gender&mdash;some identify strongly as male or female, while others shift fluidly or ignore it altogether, and still others actively reject it on philosophical grounds as a relic of their former slavery.</p>\n<p>Though android bodies are assembled using tiny machines called nanites, their complex nervous systems attract and integrate souls in the same way organic creatures do. Most androids are fully grown at the time of their birth, and can technically live forever through constant repair, though most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so to allow new souls to inhabit them&mdash;a process called renewal that&rsquo;s viewed more as procreation than suicide.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Android technology in the Pact Worlds is generally believed to have developed on Golarion in the time before the Gap, though there are strong indications that the first androids there were actually travelers from a distant star system. In the modern era, various corporations throughout the Pact Worlds system unraveled the secret to android creation and began massproducing androids as cheap, skilled labor perfect for hazardous work. This practice lasted until about 150 years ago, when the Thyst Rebellion and subsequent android revolts across the system, combined with the now legendary speech known as &ldquo;The Automaton&rsquo;s Polemic&rdquo; by android revolutionary Serphaeus-6, led governments system-wide to officially recognize all androids as independent citizens. This ruling, however, has not completely stopped unscrupulous corporations in less regulated parts of the system from crafting illegal android slaves or forcing newborn androids to &ldquo;work off&rdquo; the expense of their creation. Though androids can be found anywhere in the Pact Worlds, many gravitate toward cosmopolitan @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the machine cities of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}, and the freedom of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Android society tends to be insular. While androids are treated equitably in most settlements, especially @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, many androids have not forgotten their people&rsquo;s bondage and remain keenly aware of prejudice from other races based on their &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; origin or jealousy over the androids&rsquo; freedom from aging. This leads most androids to feel a sense of kinship with others of their kind and to go out of their way to help each other, though they may also bond with members of other races who treat them well. Despite popular belief, androids&rsquo; impressive deductive reasoning abilities do not preclude sentiment, and most androids feel emotions keenly&mdash;they simply don&rsquo;t always express them well, and different individuals may have trouble processing and communicating particular feelings. The average android alignment is a practical neutrality; they are focused on their own welfare and that of their friends.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Often cautious around strangers, androids have the most strained relationship with humanity, which built them in its image and remains their most frequent oppressor. They feel closest to shirrens, who also know what it is to be enslaved and misunderstood, and respect kasathas&rsquo; self-sufficiency. They generally dislike @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, whom they see as slavers, and only grudgingly tolerate ysoki&rsquo;s antics.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Androids adventure for many reasons: to earn a living, trace the origins of their race, or rescue androids and other creatures from servitude. Their quick thinking under fire makes them natural operatives and soldiers, while their affinity for machines makes them excellent mechanics and technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>&mdash;<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>See Android entry</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Androids are Medium humanoids with the android subtype.</p>\n<h2>Constructed</h2>\n<p>For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. In addition, androids do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Exceptional Vision</h2>\n<p>Androids have darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. See pages 263&ndash;264 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Flat Affect</h2>\n<p>Androids find emotions confusing and keep them bottled up. They take a &ndash;2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, but the DCs of Sense Motive checks attempted against them increase by 2.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade Slot</h2>\n<p>Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Most androids have the standard android racial traits detailed in the&nbsp;Core Rulebook, but individuals might have unique abilities, represented by the following alternate racial traits.</p>\n<h2>Easily Augmented</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />As artificial creatures, androids are compatible with a wide array of cybernetics. Androids who have this racial trait can install one additional cybernetic augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Impersonation Matrix</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Although most androids stand out as artificial beings, some have intricate personality matrices and physical alterations that downplay their constructed nature. Androids who have this alternate racial trait don&rsquo;t take any penalty to Disguise checks to change their appearance to a creature of a different race or type if they are disguising themselves as a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}. If the android also has the xenometric android alternate racial trait (see page 17), this benefit instead applies to Disguise checks to change appearance to that of the race chosen along with the xenometric android alternate racial trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces the +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep from the constructed trait. The android retains all the other features of the constructed trait.</p>\n<h2>Infosphere Integration</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />The artificial brain an android possesses can allow better compatibility with infospheres and direct downloads of information. An android with this trait has a built-in comm unit that can be accessed without needing to use their hands. Once per day, whenever the android takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, they can choose one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill. The chosen skill becomes a class skill for them, and they gain Skill Focus as a bonus feat with that skill. This decision lasts until the next time the android uses this trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces exceptional vision.</p>\n<h2>Multilingual</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />New languages are easy for some androids to learn. An android with this racial trait knows four additional languages at 1st level. In addition, whenever such an android invests a skill rank into Culture, they learn two new languages instead of one.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Nanite Upgrade</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Specialized nanites maintain an android body, but they can be upgraded to perform additional tasks. Androids who have this racial trait gain Nanite integration as a bonus feat, ignoring the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Xenometric Android</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Although most androids are manufactured to resemble @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, those crafted in the likenesses of other species exist. Such &ldquo;xenometrics&rdquo; possess abilities that mirror those of other races, sometimes even using hybrid tech to duplicate magic abilities.</p>\n<p>An android with this trait selects one of the species detailed in the paragraphs below. This choice cannot be changed. In addition to possessing physical features resembling those of the chosen species, the android&rsquo;s size category and reach changes to match the chosen race. In addition, xenometric androids gain some of the chosen species&rsquo; racial traits, which are noted in parentheses next to the race&rsquo;s name; these count as racial traits for the purposes of prerequisites. If a gained racial trait determines land speed, the android uses the speed as defined by that racial trait instead of that of the android. If the chosen species has a different type than humanoid, the xenometric android&rsquo;s type changes to match.</p>\n<p>Starfinder Core Rulebook options are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf} (darkvision, slow but steady), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf} (elven immunities, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} (@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} magic, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf} (adaptability, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} (darkvision, intimidating, self-sufficient), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling} (keen senses, sneaky, sure-footed), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} (four-armed, natural grace), lashunta (lashunta magic, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} (blindsense, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} (low-light vision, natural weapons), and ysoki (cheek pouches, darkvision).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive options are dragonkin (draconic immunities, flight), formian (limited telepathy, natural weapons), haan (firespray, slow fall), kalo (kalo movement, kalo vision), maraquoi (blindsense, prehensile tail), nuar (natural weapons, swift), verthani (skill focus, skin mimic), and wrikreechee (snag, wrikreechee movement).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive 2 options are hobgoblin (fearsome, sneaky), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} (fierce survivalist, orc ferocity), pahtra (nimble, talented), and vlaka (cold resistance, perceptive).</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Pact Worlds option is the strix (nightborn, strix mobility).</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot and exceptional vision.</p>"},"hp":{"min":1,"value":4},"modifiers":[{"_id":"3e41133e-52af-41f8-bc3c-43a97e2f98e2","name":"Constructed","type":"racial","condition":"","effectType":"saves","enabled":false,"max":2,"modifier":"2","modifierType":"formula","notes":"For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).

Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read only: Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark. Next to the words was a drawing of a symbol&mdash;the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph&rsquo;s chest. Yet the biggest shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note&rsquo;s writer had clearly intended&mdash; for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<p>Disoriented, Iseph did their best to disappear into Aballon&rsquo;s bustling android population. Eventually, Iseph worked up the courage to begin making surreptitious inquiries about the mysterious symbol and their own past. All of these searches failed, yet Iseph began to get the sense of being watched. When a contact claiming to have information was slain in a massive bombing clearly meant for Iseph, Iseph fled to the Diaspora. There they joined up with the Android Abolitionist Front, becoming a black ops specialist until a disagreement with their handler led them to go independent. Today, Iseph officially hires on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport or exploratory missions.

Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds&mdash;for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they&rsquo;ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate &ldquo;softer&rdquo; races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails&mdash;while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony &ldquo;beards&rdquo; that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that&rsquo;s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk&rsquo;s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who&rsquo;ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn&rsquo;t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding&mdash;especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk&rsquo;s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict&mdash;often called the Silent War&mdash;might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids&rsquo; dispassionate consistency, kasathas&rsquo; sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture&rsquo;s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-8 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>200-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>16 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>Armor Savant</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology.

For more details, see page 264.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p>Vesk can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1&ndash;1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate racial traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>Brawny</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Cave Senses</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Vesk who grew up underground in twisted caverns have more sensitive hearing. They have low-light vision and gain blindsight (sound) 60 feet, but they take a &ndash;4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet and take a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls against targets beyond 60 feet in bright light.</p>\n<p>This replaces low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Expanded Lung Capacity</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk have extraordinary lung capacity. These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this racial trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a vacuum, or would otherwise begin suffocating or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Forceful Mind</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Frilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS<em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Observant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this racial trait select either Perception or Sense Motive. They gain a +3 racial bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Prehensile Tail</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Vesk Venom</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this racial trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong>Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk&rsquo;s level + the vesk&rsquo;s Constitution modifier)<br /><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong>1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong>1/round for 6 rounds<br /><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong>Progression track is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Healthy}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Sluggish}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Stiffened}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.<br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>1 save.

classic vesk fashion, Obozaya Ymeros lets her friends shorten her name to &ldquo;Obo,&rdquo; but not even Damoritosh himself can protect those who use her nickname without earning that right first.</p>\n<p>Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime, planetary capital of the Veskarium, to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. Distinguishing herself with her determination and ferocity on the sports field and in the dueling ring&mdash;if not in her academic studies&mdash;Obozaya established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete.</p>\n<p>Obozaya took to military life, and soon outpaced many in her cohort. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo had no desire to spend her entire life at the same rank as her parents. Her dreams of glory were hardly unique, but she quickly proved herself in several battles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connections. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit one with family ties to high-ranking military officials&mdash;she found herself assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for righteous combat. It soon became clear that neither appeals to her superiors nor prayers to Damoritosh the Conqueror were going to get her a better assignment. Thus, as her first term of enlistment drew to a close, she left the military.</p>\n<p>From there, Obozaya followed in the footsteps of many other legendary vesk warriors and left home to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she&rsquo;d been searching for: an endless series of battles, with no restrictions but her own sense of honor. Rather than signing on with an established mercenary company, Obozaya worked primarily with small groups of explorers and adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to her vanity. As Obozaya&rsquo;s fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and she believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard. Though she has drifted away from Damoritosh&rsquo;s faith, she still adores using his sacred doshko for close-up fighting.</p>\n<p>Obozaya is a study in contrasts. While she appreciates material wealth and creature comforts, her true desire is for recognition. This is perhaps best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, which usually projects a modified version of Damoritosh&rsquo;s symbol to advertise her as a warrior for hire, but which is capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows exactly who&rsquo;s coming for them. Brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya nevertheless finds herself a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for any education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she&rsquo;s not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word or renege on a contract. In conversations with new people, she&rsquo;s either unnervingly stoic or direct to the point of rudeness, and thinks that most species talk more than they need to as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p>\n<p>All of which makes it that much more surprising to discover how much her companions adore her. Sure, Obo may explain her loyalty as a mercenary&rsquo;s pragmatism, yet everyone in her crew knows they can count on &ldquo;the big lizard&rdquo; to pull them out of a scrape, no matter the cost. As with many vesk, her gruff manner is punctuated with sudden outpourings of emotion, and with her characteristic directness, Obo finds no fear or shame in telling her friends how much she loves them. Much of her life is spent on or training for missions, yet when she sets out to celebrate a success, it&rsquo;s with her trademark bombastic zeal. Eschewing the berserker drugs favored by some of her kindred, she&rsquo;s instead fond of the Veskarium nose-hookahs sometimes called &ldquo;dragon&rsquo;s breath,&rdquo; as well as the mildly hallucinogenic brain snails of Vesk-2 and other traditional vesk snacks. More than one bar has been sacrificed to (and well compensated for) her parties, and the heavy bass of her beloved revelaz dance-pop beats is notorious for bursting rivets on ship bulkheads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Armored Advantage </strong>Obozaya gains a +1 insight bonus to her KAC when wearing armor. This bonus has already been added to her Armor Class above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Charge Attack (Ex)</strong> Obozaya can charge as a standard action without taking the normal penalties for charging, and can substitute a bull rush for the attack at the end of her charge.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cleave </strong>Obozaya can take a &ndash;2 penalty to her AC until her next turn in order to use the Cleave feat. This allows her to make a melee attack against a foe adjacent to her as a standard action. If she hits, she can make a second melee attack against a different foe adjacent to both her and the first foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Coordinated Shot </strong>When Obozaya is threatening a foe with a melee weapon, any ally with line of sight to that foe without Obozaya granting the foe cover gains a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Deadly Aim </strong>When Obozaya takes the attack or full attack action with a weapon, she can take a &ndash;2 penalty to her attack rolls to add 2 to her damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Grunt </strong>Treat Obozaya&rsquo;s Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining her bulk limit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision </strong>Obozaya can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Melee Striker </strong>Obozaya adds an additional bonus to her melee damage equal to half her Strength bonus. This is already added in to her attacks above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Obozaya gains a +4 bonus to her AC against attacks of opportunity she provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons </strong>Obozaya&rsquo;s unarmed attacks deal lethal damage and aren&rsquo;t considered archaic, and she adds 1-1/2 &times; her character level to the damage (rather than just adding her level with Weapon Specialization).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Quick Draw </strong>Obozaya can draw a weapon as a swift action.Step Up and Strike When a foe adjacent to Obozaya attempts to take a guarded step, as a reaction Obozaya can move up to 10 feet (as long as she ends adjacent to the creature taking the guarded step), and can make an attack of opportunity against that foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization </strong>Obozaya adds her character level to the damage she deals with most melee weapons, longarms, heavy weapons, sniper weapons, and grenades, and half her character level to the damage she deals with operative melee weapons and small arms. This is already added in to her attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Autotarget Rifle </strong>This two-handed rifle fires physical bullets and can be fired 10 times before it must be reloaded. As a full action, Obozaya can attack with it in automatic mode, using all its remaining ammunition and attacking multiple targets in a 30-foot cone. Beginning with the nearest target, Obozaya makes one attack roll against each target in the cone. This expends 2 rounds of ammunition per target attacked, and when the rifle runs out of ammunition, it can&rsquo;t target any more creatures. Obozaya rolls damage only once, applying it to all targets hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blaze Flame Doshko </strong>This two-handed weapon has a battery with 20 charges and uses 1 charge per minute it&rsquo;s active.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch </strong>Obozaya can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing </strong>Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Snub Scattergun </strong>This two-handed ranged weapon can be fired eight times before it must be reloaded. It targets all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Obozaya makes an attack roll against each creature in this area, then rolls damage only once and applies it to all creatures she hits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Targeting Computer </strong>The targeting computer in Obozaya&rsquo;s armor allows her to ignore the concealment (other than total concealment) of any target.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Vesk Overplate II </strong>While wearing this armor, Obozaya can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days.</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":["lgt","hvy","shl"]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["common","vesk"]},"senses":"Low-light vision","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Obozaya L8","actorId":"GOPPFSDtpGiNwZSk","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/iconics/Soldier - Obozaya.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about entertainment combat, fighting styles, and gladiatorial traditions by 5. Intimidate is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate checks.

You're famous enough that others require only a DC 15 Culture check to recognize your name and a DC 25 Culture check to recognize you out of context from your appearance alone. Because you're famous for your brutal stage presence, you can spend twice the normal amount of time when using Intimidate to bully a creature whose attitude is indifferent or better. If you do and succeed at the check, when the effect wears off, the creature's attitude toward you is worsened only to indifferent, not unfriendly.

As long as your gear is in good condition, you don't take any circumstantial penalties for wearing light armor or heavy armor in social situations (such as wearing golemforged plate to a formal event). You can use Intimidate or Profession (gladiator; Charisma) to \"hide\" up to two smaller weapons (such as a small arm or one-handed melee weapon with light bulk) or one larger melee weapon on your body, though you do not conceal the weapon so much as convince others to accept your carrying it without any objections.

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Str, -2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike).

When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2–2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wq8dRJYQ58VZQuZU]{First Vanguard Aspect - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics.

If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Dysu4F8licjEb2FY]{Vanguard Discipline - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.<br><br>At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property.

They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of your next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to you or you designate a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If your entropic focus takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. If you are at least 6th level, you can expend a Resolve Point to designate an adjacent, willing ally as your entropic focus as a reaction when they take damage (and gain EP from damage they take from the triggering attack, if appropriate).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entropy Points can be expended in various ways, some of which you gain through vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor Class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move your speed, you can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type you have).</li>\n<li>As a move action, you can expend EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack you make before the start of your next turn. You must decide how many EP to expend when you take this move action, and you can’t expend more EP than your level. If the boosted entropic strike hits, you deal +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li>\n</ul>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Vanguard","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"jIlRqyOVWFNTquOF","name":"Entropic Strike (Su)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":500000,"system":{"type":"","ability":"con","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"msak","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[{"formula":"1d3+3","operator":"and","types":{"acid":true,"bludgeoning":true}}]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.WDvGdJ5mMpAD9cWQ]{Vanguard}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table below). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 141px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\"><strong>Entropic Strike Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":"","descriptor":"negate"},"source":"Vanguard","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"vLNpyYpbLhwH6Ziw","name":"First Vanguard Aspect","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":600000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.WDvGdJ5mMpAD9cWQ]{Vanguard}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics.

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br><br>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br><br>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.<br><br><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)<br><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.XEZ8TnivxFRh1ooE]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency.

When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UVNOjH2ERlQjcGnU]{Zenith Revelation - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br><br>Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a –5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br><br>In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":7},"isCaster":false,"kas":"cha","levels":8,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":true,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 100","sp":{"min":1,"value":7},"will":"fast"}},{"_id":"jYIBJkZgVgx6mJT9","name":"Kasatha","type":"race","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"humanoid","abilityMods":{"parts":[[2,"str"],[2,"wis"],[-2,"int"]]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>Originally from a planet orbiting a dying star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed kasathas maintain a reputation as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens&mdash;races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they&rsquo;re ready to write all @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>120-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>25 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>Desert Stride</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>Four-Armed</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment.

Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned.

At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon’s damage. <br><br>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat).

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"

The solarian can place the crystal inside his mote as a standard action. While within a mote, a crystal applies its effects any time that mote is in a solar weapon form. A crystal within a mote can&rsquo;t be interacted with in any way other than via abilities that specifically target a mote. The solarian can remove the crystal from his mote as a standard action, and the crystal falls loose if the mote is deactivated in any way. A solarian can&rsquo;t have more than one crystal in his mote at a given time.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal doesn&rsquo;t give a solarian the option to create a solar weapon if he did not choose that option for his solar manifestation. Most weapon crystals increase the amount of damage attacks with the solar weapon deal. This increased damage is normally the same type of damage the solarian weapon deals (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). If a solarian crystal&rsquo;s damage entry lists an abbreviation after the damage, however, the additional damage the solar weapon deals is of the indicated type.</p>\n<p>Even if a solarian weapon crystal&rsquo;s extra damage is a type of energy damage, attacks with the solar weapon still target KAC, not EAC. If a solarian crystal lists a critical effect, that critical effect applies to any critical hit the solar weapon makes while the solarian crystal is within the solarian&rsquo;s mote. For example, a solarian with a minor photon crystal and a base solar weapon damage of 2d6 deals 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, plus 1d6 fire damage, on a hit with his solar weapon.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal is a hybrid item that blends magic and technology. When a weapon crystal is within a mote and the solarian uses the mote in solar weapon form, the solar weapon is considered magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broken Solarian Crystals</strong>: If a solarian weapon crystal with the broken condition is inside a solarian&rsquo;s solar mote, the solarian takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack and damage rolls with the solar weapon, and the solar weapon can&rsquo;t deal extra critical effects. Both effects last until the crystal is repaired. As hybrid items, solarian crystals can be repaired using the make whole or mending spells, or with the Engineering or Mysticism skills, as described in the Skills chapter.</li>\n</ul>"},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"hands":0,"identified":true,"level":8,"modifiers":[{"_id":"0e1d8c67-c8eb-45c2-8644-3d6ba5521aff","name":"Graviton Crystal, minor","type":"untyped","condition":"","effectType":"all-damage","enabled":true,"max":6,"modifier":"1d6","modifierType":"formula","notes":"","source":"Solarian Weapon Crystal","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""}],"price":9200,"quantity":1,"source":"CRB pg. 180","usage":{"per":"","value":0}}},{"_id":"hNjHY1Pb1CdSj5dI","name":"Mk 1 Synaptic Accelerators (Dex)","type":"augmentation","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":800000,"system":{"type":"personal","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"attributes":{"ac":{"value":""},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":""},"hp":{"max":"","value":6},"size":"medium","sturdy":false},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"identified":true,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":0,"quantity":1,"source":"","system":"none"}},{"_id":"yPBQmRmQSTGnDrom","name":"Mk 1 Synaptic Accelerators (Str)","type":"augmentation","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":900000,"system":{"type":"personal","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"attributes":{"ac":{"value":""},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":""},"hp":{"max":"","value":6},"size":"medium","sturdy":false},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"identified":true,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":0,"quantity":1,"source":"","system":"none"}},{"_id":"tLqPsSd5mpoRadl0","name":"Corona (Su)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/corona.webp","sort":318750,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"action","condition":"","cost":1},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"none","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl21_LabelName\">As a standard action, you can surround your body with an envelope of fiery plasma.

Yet while Altronus was an excellent scholar, he had trouble focusing on a single topic for long, and his research inevitably wandered into unrelated sidetracks. One of Altronus&rsquo;s more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, the guiding philosophy of the solarians. Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery and taught to draw strength and focus from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and was soon allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship&rsquo;s famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasathan brains could be experienced.</p>\n<p>During one of his shifts, Altronus attempted to confront a suspicious adata, only to discover it was actually a small gray humanoid in the process of hacking the Sensorium feed. Outmatched by the creature&rsquo;s strange weaponry and quickly disarmed, Altronus nevertheless managed to seal the access node&rsquo;s security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside. He confronted the prospect of his imminent death, and found that in it, he at last truly understood the Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it. And the universe answered.</p>\n<p>Altronus was surprised to find a long golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm, yet he had seen enough solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy, and leapt to attack. Still outmatched, Altronus knew he didn&rsquo;t need to win&mdash;only buy time until help arrived.</p>\n<p>At last, ship security arrived, dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien toggled a device on its arm&mdash;and detonated its own head like a bomb. When several true adata arrived, they attempted to pull meaning from the alien brain-splatter, recovering two ideas: that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds, and that something important called &ldquo;Phase Three&rdquo; was approaching.</p>\n<p>The Doyenate was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes, after which official attention turned elsewhere. Yet Altronus couldn&rsquo;t let the issue lie. Realizing he could never become an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him, he left the Idari, vowing to chase down every strange occurrence until he unraveled the alien conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, Altronus often signs on with adventuring companies as a guard, scout, or researcher, yet his primary goal remains researching the conspiracy he first glimpsed that night in the Sensorium. Members of other races often see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist, yet any skepticism as to his usefulness disappears in the first firefight, as he launches himself into the fray and &ldquo;lets the cosmos take control,&rdquo; slicing through hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Black Hole (Su)</strong> When fully attuned to graviton mode, as a standard action Altronus can pull any number of creatures he targets that are within 25 feet of him toward him. Each target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or move 5 feet closer. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blind-Fight </strong>When Altronus misses a melee attack because of concealment, he can reroll his miss chance once to see if he actually hit. He is not flat-footed against melee attacks from creatures he cannot see, can withdraw from such creatures he cannot see, and doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt an Acrobatics check to move at full speed while blinded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Corona (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Altronus can wreathe his body in flames for 1 round, gaining cold resistance 10, and any adjacent creature that hits him with a melee attack takes 2d6 fire damage. If Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to proton mode, the effect lasts until he loses his attunement, and any creature that starts its turn adjacent to him takes 4 fire damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dark Matter </strong>As a move action, Altronus can gain DR 1/&mdash; for 1 round. When Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, he can instead gain DR 2/&mdash;, and the DR lasts as long as he remains graviton-attuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision </strong>Altronus can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Desert Stride </strong>Altronus can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at his normal rate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashing Strikes (Ex) </strong>When Altronus makes a full attack entirely with melee weapons, he takes a &ndash;3 penalty to each attack roll rather than &ndash;4.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Four-Armed </strong>Altronus has four arms, all of which can wield and carry items normally, though this does not affect how many attacks he can make each round.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Gravity Surge (Su)</strong> As a full action, Altronus can perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a foe within 30 feet with a +15 attack bonus. When he is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode and has a hand free, if he disarms a target of an item, it flies to his hand, and if he trips a target, he can pull it up to 10 feet closer to him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Altronus gains a +4 bonus to his AC against attacks of opportunity he provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Plasma Sheath </strong>As a move action, Altronus can cause all his solar weapon damage to become fire damage (though his attacks still target KAC) for 1 round. If he is attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, he also increases the damage dealt by 2, and the effect lasts as long as he maintains stellar attunement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sidereal Influence </strong>Outside of combat, Altronus can tap into stellar influences to assist in him various tasks. He must meditate for 1 minute and then chooses either Diplomacy or Stealth. He adds a +1d6 insight bonus to checks with the selected skill until he enters combat, falls unconscious, sleeps, or meditates to choose another skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Solar Manifestation (Solar Weapon)</strong> Altronus has a mote of yellow light that orbits him. He can grab this and turn it into a solar weapon with the same ease as drawing a weapon. It is considered a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals 2d6 slashing damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spring Attack </strong>As a full action, Altronus can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack at any point during this movement without provoking attacks of opportunity from the target of his melee attack. He must move at least 10 feet before making the melee attack, and cannot make that attack against a creature that was adjacent to him at the beginning of his turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Stellar Mode </strong>At the beginning of Altronus&rsquo;s first round in a combat, he must choose one of three modes&mdash;graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. If graviton- or photon-attuned, he gains 1 attunement point for the appropriate mode. Each round, he either maintains that mode (gaining another point of attunement, to a maximum of 3), or becomes unattuned (losing all attunement points, and he can then enter a new mode on the following turn). If Altronus has 1 or 2 points in a mode, he is attuned to that mode. If he has 3 points in a mode, he is fully attuned to that mode. Some of his abilities function only when Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to the graviton or photon mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When attuned in graviton mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to his Reflex saves.</li>\n<li>When attuned in photon mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Supernova (Su) </strong>When Altronus is fully attuned to photon mode, as a standard action he can deal 9d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex DC 16 half). After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tip of the Tongue </strong>Once per day, Altronus can reroll any one skill check to recall knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Advanced Semi-Auto Pistol </strong>This weapon fires physical bullets and can be fired 12 times before it must be reloaded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Beacon </strong>This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 50-foot radius. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>D-Suit II </strong>While wearing this armor, Altronus can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 7 days. Its infrared sensors give Altronus darkvision. Its jump jets allow Altronus to fly up to 30 feet as part of a move action, but he must land at the end of his movement or fall.

Generations ago, however, a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the hive mind, with each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism, these renegades rejected the Swarm&rsquo;s mindless consumption, forming a new race called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.</p>\n<p>Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae. Unlike many arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands. In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these &ldquo;mating arms&rdquo; are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes&mdash;to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p>\n<p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. In some shirren societies, a single host queen incubates for many partners and is considered the true parent, while in others, three-party marriages are common. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and they are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Not even shirrens know where the Swarm first evolved, for its vast biological colony-fleet has traveled the stars for ages and feels no need to keep track of such things. After splitting from the Swarm, the newly self-aware shirrens scattered to a number of nearby systems. A large contingent found its way to the Pact Worlds, making first contact with Vercite aethership crews and setting up a colony in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}&rsquo;s parched Fullbright region. Since then, shirrens have spread throughout the Pact Worlds.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm, they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While this ability is not always beneficial&mdash;some shirrens deliberately drug themselves this way, becoming &ldquo;option junkies&rdquo; blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions&mdash;freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. This is especially true with regard to religion, for what choice is more important than how to spend the afterlife?</p>\n<p>At the same time, having evolved from hive creatures, shirrens remain highly communal by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} standards. Even when working with other races, they seek to foster community and teamwork and do what&rsquo;s best for the group. They are often lawful good, though loyalty and a utilitarian emphasis on &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; can also lead them down questionable paths.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Most of the common races find shirrens agreeable and useful allies, though their telepathic communication and chittering mouthparts can be disconcerting. Shirrens, for their part, are positively inclined toward all the major races, especially ysoki for their communal tendencies and zest for life. Though lashuntas often maintain their prejudice against insectile races, most shirrens don&rsquo;t hold this against them, as they themselves fear nothing more than the Swarm that spawned them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Less inclined toward violence than many races, shirrens often sign on with starship crews as ambassadors, medics, technicians, and other such noncombat roles, especially as mystics acting as ship chaplains. They adore working as part of a team and are often voices of reason in chaotic situations. This general friendliness should not be mistaken for weakness, however, as shirrens fighting for the lives of their comrades can be terrifyingly lethal, fearlessly undertaking suicidal missions for the good of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-6 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-150 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>5 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>50+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are Medium humanoids with the shirren subtype.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Shirrens&rsquo; sensitive antennae grant them blindsense (vibration)&mdash;the ability to sense vibrations in the air&mdash;with a range of 30 feet.

You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known.

You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br><br>Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks.

This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells.

This bond lasts until dispelled or until you create a new healer’s bond, which immediately ends the previous one. At 11th level, when you gain the telepathic bond class feature, you also gain the effects of <em>status</em> on all creatures linked by your telepathic bond.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.hpoMkCR8INB72QbM]{Steal Life (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to steal part of a creature’s life force and transfer it to yourself or others. You must touch the target (requiring a successful melee attack against its EAC), which deals 1d6 damage for every 2 mystic levels you have (maximum 10d6). Choose an ally within 30 feet; that ally recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt (to a maximum of the foe’s remaining Hit Points). Alternatively, you can heal yourself instead, but you restore only a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If this heals the recipient (you or your ally) up to maximum Hit Points, any excess persists for 1 hour as temporary Hit Points.

When you use healing channel as a full action, it heals all allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature within 120 feet (as well as all other allies within 30 feet).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JgygiXsLGb6tlkFq]{Channel Life (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you use healing channel on a creature that has died within 1 round, you can bring it back to life as per a 5th-level <em>mystic cure</em> spell.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NSXREp19pTNTmWTs]{Deny Death (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to death effects and negative levels.

They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments&nbsp;</strong>+2 to any one ability score<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feat</h2>\n<p>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Skilled</h2>\n<p>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />The cultural, genetic, and mystical influences that some humans are subjected to can produce racial traits different from the norm.</p>\n<h2>Adopted</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />Many humans thrive in racially diverse metropolitan areas, and some individuals are adopted by members of a different species.

Navasi quickly grew dissatisfied with high-society life, and began to dream of stealing the affluent&rsquo;s unearned wealth and giving it to those in need. She eventually snuck away to join up with the piratical Free Captains of the Diaspora. Once there, however, poverty gave her little choice in the jobs she took, with her guild masters forcing her to steal from the fortunate and unfortunate alike. A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she&rsquo;d taken for granted, and it taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first needed to take care of herself. She quickly gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and face around, spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That all changed when she met another rebellious young woman and fell in love. Together, they sought to pull a fast one on Navasi&rsquo;s bosses, sabotaging an attempt to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi&rsquo;s companion sacrificed herself to save Navasi&rsquo;s life, giving the young envoy a chance to flee the Diaspora. As she made her way back to Absalom Station with the medship, knowing that neither the pirates nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook both of her former lives and took the name of her fallen love&mdash;Navasi&mdash; swearing that henceforth she&rsquo;d carry on the fight they&rsquo;d started together, stealing only from those who deserved it and putting her finger in the eye of all who thrive on exploitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Expertise (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;If Navasi has at least 1 Resolve Point remaining when she attempts a Bluff or Sense Motive check, she can roll 1d6 and add it to the result as an insight bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Get &rsquo;Em (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As a move action, Navasi selects one foe within 60 feet that she can see or hear, and that can see or hear her.

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and humans respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Int, -2 Con<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>keen senses</em>, or <em>unseen servant</em>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn’t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can’t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br><br>At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <em>darkvision</em>, <em>lesser resistant armor</em>, <em>life bubble</em>, or <em>spider climb</em>.<br><br>At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <em>arcane sight</em>, <em>flight</em> (spell level 3rd or lower), <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>tongues</em>.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ja89jy7LlkSG4Zzu]{Resolve Attunement (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic. Each time you cast a 6th-level spell, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum. This applies only to spells you cast using your normal 6th-level spell slots, not to those you cast using magic items or other methods such as fuse spells.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.phzlgejG53nzMKb0]{Fuse Spells (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can combine lower-level spell slots to cast higher-level spells. As part of casting a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exchange a number of unused spell slots for a single spell slot of a higher level; this expends the lower-level spell slots. Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn’t count as such for resolve attunement.<br><br>Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p5xoDQXN2ZcWuW71]{Cache Augmentation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Pf9uh67LQ85K52AF]{Cache Hacks (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Nvh2F2YOmAjRbzOz]{Hack Capacitor (Su)}</p>"},"fort":"slow","hp":{"min":1,"value":5},"isCaster":true,"kas":"int","levels":8,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 118","sp":{"min":1,"value":5},"will":"fast"}},{"_id":"JaW8ICxGmquJNa6H","name":"Spell Cache (Su)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/spell_cache.webp","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.classes\" data-id=\"IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Technomancer</a></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">As the culmination of your early study of the fundamental forces of the galaxy, you have created a spell cache that allows you to store and access spells.

You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.

Komena&rsquo;s proximity to the formian-inhabitedcontinent of the Colonies had made it a center of military activity for millennia, constantly besieged by the bug-people as their armies crossed the notoriously embattled chain of islands between continents, laying waste to the landscape in a total war. Yet to the Danviris, it was always a home filled with hope and promise. Raia&rsquo;s parents were diplomats, and they devoted their lives to brokering a peace between the lashuntas and the formians, a goal that spanned decades. They taught their daughter the value of all sentient life, explaining that even among creatures like the insectile formians, who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities&mdash;basic structures like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important in their minds were the differences: the details that separate one species from another not only make them interesting but also can teach the diligent observer incredible new things and inspire one to question and reexamine one&rsquo;s own assumptions and beliefs. In the eyes of the alien, they taught, one can gain new personal insight&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact that Raia&rsquo;s parents actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced their teachings in the young lashunta&rsquo;s mind. Raia became almost obsessed with alien life-forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and she dreamed of someday traveling among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example of her parents, both of whom are damaya.</p>\n<p>When she was old enough, Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat&rsquo;s famed universities. Her aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology, applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa&rsquo;s teachings, seeking self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one&rsquo;s mind and intellect.</p>\n<p>It was also at university that Raia met Danese, an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled withthe exotic ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese&rsquo;s quick wit and keen intellect that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first &ldquo;alien&rdquo; that Raia befriended, and over the course of innumerable late-night study sessions and heavily armed nature hikes through the nearby jungles, their friendship soon blossomed into love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time together at university, but they both knew they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete. Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission in order to remain with her, but Raia refused to accept that choice. In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow Yaraesa&rsquo;s example and figure things out for themselves&mdash;intellectually and spiritually, as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell and promised to reunite whenever their circumstances allowed.</p>\n<p>After completing her studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund her life&rsquo;s work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn&rsquo;t hold to any unrealistic expectation of noninterference in alien cultures, but she believes strongly in doing the right thing and in always striving for honor, compassion, and justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends still on Castrovel, Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together, but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning, and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend, and study&mdash;one species at a time</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Amplified Glitch</strong> As a standard action, Raia can cause technological devices to briefly malfunction in loud, distracting ways. She can target four creatures, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart and all of which must be within 30 feet of a technological device. With a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 the CR of the highest-CR target), she can cause targets to be shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which she exceeds the check&rsquo;s DC. A creature she targets with this feat is immune to further uses of this feat for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Empowered Weapon</strong> As a move action, Raia can expend a spell slot to grant her weapon a bonus to attacks equal to the level of the spell slot, and her attacks with that weapon deal +1d6 bonus damage per level of spell slot expended. This bonus lasts until the start of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Magic</strong> Raia has the following spell-like abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daze: This spell causes a humanoid creature of CR 3 or lower to be dazed for 1 round (Will DC 11 negates).</li>\n<li>Detect Thoughts: Raia can detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures within a 60-foot cone, and if she concentrates, she can attempt to read those thoughts (Will DC 12 negates).</li>\n<li>Psychokinetic Hand: Once this spell is cast, as long as Raia concentrates (a standard action each round), she can take a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. She can&rsquo;t perform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but she can push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Raia can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with her.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Cache (Su)</strong> Raia has an arm implant that functions as her spell cache. Once per day, she can cast one of her spells known even if she has expended all her spell slots of that spell level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Raia can cast the following spells as a standard action unless the spell says otherwise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Comprehend Languages</em>: Raia can understand spoken, signed, or written languages for 40 minutes.</li>\n<li><em>Dancing Lights</em>: Raia can create up to four flashlight-sized lights in a 10-foot-radius area.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Magic</em>: This spell reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical, and with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em>Energy Ray</em>: Raia can fire a ray of energy (choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire) as a ranged attack (+5 bonus) that targets EAC and deals 1d3 damage of the chosen energy type.</li>\n<li><em>Flight (1st-Level Spell)</em>: One Medium or smaller falling creature or object per level, all within 20 feet of each other, falls at 60 feet per round and takes no damage when it lands. This spell can be cast as a reaction.</li>\n<li><em>Flight (2nd-Level Spell)</em>: One creature or object (up to 100 pounds/10 bulk per level) within 35 feet moves up or down 20 feet per round, as Kaia directs as a move action.</li>\n<li><em>Ghost Sound</em>: Raia can create an illusory sound (DC 15 to disbelieve) that can be as loud as 20 normal humans.</li>\n<li><em>Grease</em>: Raia can coat a 10-foot square or one object with slippery grease, causing creatures in the area to fall prone or drop the object (Reflex DC 16 partial).</li>\n<li><em>Invisibility</em>: The creature touched is invisible for 4 minutes or until it attacks.</li>\n<li><em>Magic Missile:</em> Raia can fire two missiles of magical energy that automatically hit and deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If she casts this spell as a full action, Raia fires three missiles.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mending</em>: This spell restores 1d4 HP to one object or construct of up to 1 bulk.</li>\n<li><em>Overheat</em>: This spell deals 2d8 fire damage to creatures in a 15-foot burst (Reflex DC 16 half).</li>\n<li><em>Transfer Charge</em>: Raia can transfer charges between two

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and humans respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Int, -2 Con<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Komena&rsquo;s proximity to the formian-inhabitedcontinent of the Colonies had made it a center of military activity for millennia, constantly besieged by the bug-people as their armies crossed the notoriously embattled chain of islands between continents, laying waste to the landscape in a total war. Yet to the Danviris, it was always a home filled with hope and promise. Raia&rsquo;s parents were diplomats, and they devoted their lives to brokering a peace between the lashuntas and the formians, a goal that spanned decades. They taught their daughter the value of all sentient life, explaining that even among creatures like the insectile formians, who were so unlike lashuntas and had been enemies for so long, one can find similarities&mdash;basic structures like culture, society, and civilization. But even more important in their minds were the differences: the details that separate one species from another not only make them interesting but also can teach the diligent observer incredible new things and inspire one to question and reexamine one&rsquo;s own assumptions and beliefs. In the eyes of the alien, they taught, one can gain new personal insight&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact that Raia&rsquo;s parents actually succeeded in helping to negotiate peace with the Colonies only reinforced their teachings in the young lashunta&rsquo;s mind. Raia became almost obsessed with alien life-forms. She devoured any texts she could find that described the myriad species that inhabited the worlds beyond Castrovel, and she dreamed of someday traveling among the stars and meeting new species. When she reached puberty, Raia chose to develop into the tall, intellectual damaya subspecies, following the example of her parents, both of whom are damaya.</p>\n<p>When she was old enough, Raia applied to and was accepted into one of Qabarat&rsquo;s famed universities. Her aptitude exams showed a talent for both technology and spellcasting, so she studied the discipline of technomancy, using experimentation to blend science and magic together. At the same time, however, she also excelled in xenobiology and xenoanthropology, applying academic rigor to her childhood passion. During this time, Raia discovered Yaraesa, the lashunta goddess of knowledge and wisdom, whose faith was more akin to the scientific method. Raia wholeheartedly embraced Yaraesa&rsquo;s teachings, seeking self-perfection through the acquisition of knowledge and the development of one&rsquo;s mind and intellect.</p>\n<p>It was also at university that Raia met Danese, an exchange student from Triaxus. Raia was immediately enthralled withthe exotic ryphorian and his silky white fur, but it was Danese&rsquo;s quick wit and keen intellect that turned the initial attraction into something more. Danese was the first &ldquo;alien&rdquo; that Raia befriended, and over the course of innumerable late-night study sessions and heavily armed nature hikes through the nearby jungles, their friendship soon blossomed into love. Raia and Danese were inseparable during their time together at university, but they both knew they would need to reassess their relationship when their studies were complete. Danese had already accepted a commission in the Skyfire Legion and had to return to Triaxus after graduation, while Raia had been accepted into a graduate program on Absalom Station. Danese offered to resign his commission in order to remain with her, but Raia refused to accept that choice. In her opinion, neither of them should have to sacrifice their own advancement and improvement for the sake of the other; instead, each of them should follow Yaraesa&rsquo;s example and figure things out for themselves&mdash;intellectually and spiritually, as well as romantically. They bid each other a tearful farewell and promised to reunite whenever their circumstances allowed.</p>\n<p>After completing her studies, Raia realized that her passion for studying alien life-forms was actually a calling, and her technomantic abilities were the currency she could use to fund her life&rsquo;s work, exchanging her skills as a scientist and technomancer for berths on ships heading out to undiscovered regions of the Vast. Raia believes there is a certain nobility in contacting an alien species for the first time and working to ensure that both they and the peoples of the Pact Worlds advance and improve from the relationship. She seeks out new technology and alternative magical techniques from the aliens she encounters, trading her own knowledge in exchange. Raia doesn&rsquo;t hold to any unrealistic expectation of noninterference in alien cultures, but she believes strongly in doing the right thing and in always striving for honor, compassion, and justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite her love of exploration, Raia remains firmly tied to the Pact Worlds. Besides her parents and friends still on Castrovel, Raia still loves Danese, and the two remain committed to one another, even across the vast distances involved in interstellar travel. They stay in regular communication and treasure the infrequent times when their paths bring them physically close to one another. Some day, they might choose to settle down and build a life together, but for now Raia is content. She knows love, her life has purpose and meaning, and the galaxy is filled with an endless number of aliens to discover, befriend, and study&mdash;one species at a time</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Amplified Glitch</strong> As a standard action, Raia can cause technological devices to briefly malfunction in loud, distracting ways. She can target four creatures, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart and all of which must be within 30 feet of a technological device.

They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens&mdash;races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they&rsquo;re ready to write all @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>120-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>25 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>Desert Stride</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>Four-Armed</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br><br>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br><br>If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2BjD4ocSE0BL5DcN]{Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.IPDN3VDLTrrMFE2g]{Injection Expert (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.

This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.<br><br>If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster’s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the off-target condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, deafened, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, shaken, or sickened.

You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast raise dead or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage. The target takes 17d10 points of damage and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned.

You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br><br>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Biohacker","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"3Ix7Qj7s2J0JAZCb","name":"Primary Field Of Study (Ex)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":400000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.PSHcGB4UFgMSiF4V]{Biohacker}</p>\n<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty.

At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>\n<h2>Fields of Study</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.8otrqaNJyyhRtDvW]{Genetics}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ZjYCdb8f2Zmshjko]{Immunology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dCrhN6EheR1G5XN1]{Neurochemistry}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.kHeZbTmU7JXi8dbX]{Pharmacology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p98vVWLYBsMgDkXU]{Toxicology}</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Biohacker","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"fxa8qOTLABJpjthA","name":"Injection Expert (Ex)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":500000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.PSHcGB4UFgMSiF4V]{Biohacker}</p>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.

Her parents maintained a household in which discussion and debate were encouraged, with most dinnertime talks focused around the dichotomy between faith and science. Even at a young age, Barsala was included, her questions and opinions treated with respect. As a result, she found herself drawn to studying scientific disciplines, but focused on how they could help her neighbors and her community. Barsala witnessed the power of community early in her life when she lost her lowleft hand due to severe nerve damage sustained in a nasty fall and many of her family&rsquo;s neighbors came together to help her adjust to her new cybernetic prosthesis.</p>\n<p>Years later, Barsala earned her doctorate from the prestigious Sui Saolus Academy and landed a job as a junior research assistant at Iratha Incorporated, a biotech firm in Trillidiem founded by a lashunta and a kasatha. Despite barathus nearly dominating the biotech field, Iratha Incorporated is a successful corporation, focusing exclusively on augmentations for humanoids. Barsala was happy with her job, but after several months, she began to worry that her research&mdash;though pivotal for reducing implant rejection rates, among other things&mdash;was far too niche. She wondered if there was something else she could do to aid the community at large.</p>\n<p>Explaining her dilemma to a friend, Barsala hit on an idea that sparked her interest: she would start a regular holovid stream in which she would explain the basic concepts of science to viewers in a way that was fun and engaging. Branding herself as &ldquo;Dr. B,&rdquo; she rented a small studio, set up a simple lab, donned a white lab coat, and began broadcasting in her off hours. Dr. B&rsquo;s first holovids featured very basic principles&mdash;gravity, magnetism, and the like&mdash;and her production values were rough around the edges, but Barsala&rsquo;s enthusiasm and easy-to-understand explanations quickly gained her a wide audience on Bretheda&rsquo;s infosphere and beyond.</p>\n<p>However, her program didn&rsquo;t reach the same popularity as reality shows and sporting events until it caught the attention of Thalus Enthremian Damru, the kasatha co-founder of Iratha Incorporated. He saw the show&rsquo;s potential as a marketing tool but also respected Barsala&rsquo;s commitment to education. One day, Thalus approached Barsala in her Iratha lab to offer her holovid stream an official sponsorship, which would include a new studio, as well as a small staff to ensure that everything looked and sounded professional. Her new role as &ldquo;scientific ambassador&rdquo; was added to her job description, and she soon became the holovid icon she is today.</p>\n<p>Dr. B&rsquo;s Science Jubilee is popular with young members of sapient species throughout the Pact Worlds and most of Near Space, thanks to Barsala&rsquo;s engaging personality and flashy experiments. With Iratha Incorporated&rsquo;s funding, Barsala has been able to travel across the galaxy to showcase interesting scientific phenomena first-hand, including such topics as the life cycles of unusual flora and fauna, the formation of bizarre minerals and crystals, and the odd interactions between certain fundamental forces of physics. Some of the program&rsquo;s most shared episodes feature Barsala being introduced to a new species of alien animal (often with hilarious results) and the kasatha putting a scientific myth to the test (usually accompanied by explosions).</p>\n<p>Between these on-location shoots, Barsala continues her research on biotech augmentations, and occasionally, topics on her show have led her to small breakthroughs in her work and research. While these advancements have garnered some praise in the scientific community, most people only recognize the kasatha through her holovid work, with some people even believing that the &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; part of &ldquo;Dr. B&rdquo; is merely an affectation. Nevertheless, Barsala presses on with both aspects of her job, hoping she can positively impact the lives of people in one way or the other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Custom Microlab (Ex) </strong>Barsala has integrated a customized kit consisting of medical supplies, testing materials, and pharmaceutical compounds onto her prosthetic hand. She can use it to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks described below.</p>\n<p>Her custom microlab counts as an advanced medkit (granting a +2 insight bonus on Medicine checks to treat drugs, diseases, and poisons) and a chemalyzer (granting a +4 bonus on Engineering, Mysticism, and Physical Science checks to identify unknown drugs, medicinals, poisons, and other chemical substances). As long as she has her custom microlab, as a move action she can target a creature within 60 feet in her line of sight and attempt a special skill check to identify it as though her die roll were a 20: Life Science for a living creature, or Physical Science for an unliving one, with the check&rsquo;s DC determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity (page 133 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Barsala can also attune her custom microlab to 8 individual creatures. This takes 10 minutes, which she can combine with the time needed to prepare her biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If she attunes her microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond her maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be reattuned. Under some circumstances, Barsala can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.</p>\n<p>If her custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, Barsala can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. She can have only one custom microlab at a time. If she creates a new one, her old microlab functions as a normal item of whatever type she made it from.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Biohacks (Ex)</strong> Barsala can use biohacks to boost her allies or inhibit her foes. Her biohacks produce their effects only when she injects a creature with them (see below), and only she knows how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves Barsala&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until she picks it up again.</p>\n<p>Barsala can deliver any biohack she creates with any attack from an injection weapon. She must decide to use a biohack prior to the attack roll and specify which effect she&rsquo;s using. She applies the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. She does not need to preload her weapon with biohacks. If she makes a ranged attack and misses, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If Barsala&rsquo;s attack with a biohack hits but deals no damage, the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, Barsala can remove or change which biohack she&rsquo;s using as part of her next attack without taking any additional action.</p>\n<p>She can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (a level 8 consumable basic melee weapon from her custom microlab) that she can wield in one hand. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, Barsala must hit the creature with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.</p>\n<p>Barsala can inject a biohack into a willing or unconscious creature (or herself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within her reach. She can also use ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally she has attuned her custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within 60 feet. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p>The materials Barsala uses to create biohacks are inert until she activates them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks she knows. Each day after she has rested for 8 hours, Barsala can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create 6 biohacks, and this is the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; Barsala doesn&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks she&rsquo;s creating until performing the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in her possession. Barsala can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost. Whenever she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, Barsala can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those she has used, up to her maximum.</p>\n<p>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. Barsala knows the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique boosters and inhibitors granted by her primary and secondary fields of study (see below).</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Booster </span></em>- A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for 5 rounds unless it states otherwise. When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Inhibitor </span></em>- A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature&rsquo;s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for 8 rounds unless it states otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s DR by 5.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s resistance to one type of energy (her choice) by 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of her basic inhibitors at a time, though it can only be affected by multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If Barsala affects a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minor Biohacks </span></em>- Barsala can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites,and catalysts, and she can add them to any attack she makes with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. She doesn&rsquo;t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor Booster: Using a minor booster biohack allows Barsala to attempt to administer first aid with a Medicine check on targets within 60 feet of her microlab. This doesn&rsquo;t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack, and it doesn&rsquo;t have the duration of normal biohacks. Alternatively, she can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, drugs, or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, drug, or poison.</li>\n<li>Minor Inhibitor: A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance; the target takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls for 8 rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Field of Study, Genetics (Ex) </strong>Barsala has selected the genetics field of study, granting her access to a unique booster and inhibitor, as well as the gene therapy ability.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Booster </span></em>- Barsala temporarily boosts a living creature (one that does not have the unliving universal creature rule) to improve the acuity of its hearing, granting the subject the benefits of blindsense (sound) with a range of 60 feet. If the creature already has blindsense, it instead gains the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. This benefit lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inhibitor </span></em>- Barsala delivers a DNA-twisting or material-altering chemical nanite compound into a creature&rsquo;s body, imparting vulnerability to one type of energy (her choice). If the creature is immune to that energy type, this inhibitor temporarily removes that immunity and gives the creature resistance 20 to that type of energy. If the creature has resistance to that energy type, this effect instead reduces its resistance by 10 (minimum 0). This biohack does not remove a creature&rsquo;s resistance or immunity to natural hazards or environments, only to damage from energy attacks, spells, and other abilities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Gene Therapy (Ex) </strong>- As a standard action, Barsala can create and deliver a medicinal formula to a living creature that suspends the effects of damage to their mind and body. When injected, the formula allows the target to ignore the effects of all ability score damage and drain for 10 minutes. This effect lasts for 1 hour. Barsala can use this ability once, and she regains the ability to use it after she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Field of Study, Neurochemistry (Ex) </strong>Barsala has selected the neurochemistry field of study, granting her access to a unique booster and inhibitor:</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Booster </span></em>- Barsala bolsters the creature&rsquo;s brain chemistry (or other cognitive system), allowing it to ignore the effects of the confused and staggered conditions for the booster&rsquo;s duration. While the creature is ignoring these effects, the duration of the condition elapses as normal.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inhibitor </span></em>- Barsala delivers a strong chemical admixture that interferes with a creature&rsquo;s neurons (or equivalent), imparting a &ndash;2 penalty to Will saving throws.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Hampering Inhibitor (Ex)</strong> Any biohack inhibitor Barsala successfully uses against a foe decreases that foe&rsquo;s speed by half (to a minimum of 5 feet) in addition to her chosen inhibitor&rsquo;s normal effects. If the target has multiple movement types, all its speeds are decreased. An individual biohack can&rsquo;t be affected by both the hampering inhibitor and powerful biohacks theorems.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Iron Will </strong>Barsala can spend 1 RP to reroll a failed Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Injection Expert (Ex) </strong>Barsala is proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property from a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Barsala hits an ally with such a weapon, she can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting theally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When she fires a weapon with the injection special property and has multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, she chooses which type of ammunition she fires when she makes the attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Barsala gains a +4 bonus to her Armor Class against attacks of opportunity that she provokes by leaving a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Painful Injection </strong>Barsala adds half her Wisdom modifier (+2) to her damage rolls with injection weapons. This is already added to her attacks above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Powerful Biohacks (Ex)</strong> Barsala can use fringe science to tweak her biohacks so that she can affect any creature with biohacks that normally don&rsquo;t affect creatures with the unliving universal creature rule. If the biohack had the poison descriptor, she can remove that descriptor each time she uses that biohack. An individual biohack can&rsquo;t be affected by both the hampering inhibitor and powerful biohacks theorems.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Shot on the Run </strong>As a full action, Barsala can move up to her speed and make a single ranged attack at any point during her movement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spark of Ingenuity (Ex) </strong>Once per day, Barsala can alter one of her biohacks to work in a different way. When using a booster biohack, she can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster&rsquo;s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. Alternatively, she can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of her inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Treat Condition (Ex) </strong>As a standard action, Barsala can treat a willing, adjacent creature to remove the shaken, sickened, or staggered condition. This doesn&rsquo;t end the effect that caused the condition, and the target can regain the condition from any source as normal. Barsala can use this ability up to 5 times per day. She regains all expended uses of this ability when she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Barsala adds her character level to damage dealt with melee weapons and half her character level to damage dealt with operative melee weapons, small arms, and weapons with the injection ability. This has already been factored into her attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Advanced Needler Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 8 times before it needs to be reloaded. Its range increment is 40 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kasatha Microcord III</strong> While wearing this armor, Barsala can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mindhaze </strong>This is a poison with the following properties: Typepoison (injury); Save Fortitude DC 17; Track Wisdom (Healthy&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Confused&mdash;Comatose&mdash;Dead); Frequency1/round for 4 rounds; Effect Upon reaching the weakened state, the victim can&rsquo;t use telepathy or limited telepathy for 1d4 hours.

Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds&mdash;for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they&rsquo;ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate &ldquo;softer&rdquo; races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails&mdash;while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony &ldquo;beards&rdquo; that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that&rsquo;s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk&rsquo;s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who&rsquo;ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn&rsquo;t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding&mdash;especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk&rsquo;s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict&mdash;often called the Silent War&mdash;might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids&rsquo; dispassionate consistency, kasathas&rsquo; sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture&rsquo;s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-8 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>200-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>16 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>Armor Savant</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology. When wearing armor, they gain a +1 racial bonus to AC. When they&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor, their armor check penalty is 1 less severe than normal.</p>\n<h2>Fearless</h2>\n<p>Vesk receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Vesk can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p>Vesk can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1&ndash;1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate racial traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>Brawny</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Cave Senses</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Vesk who grew up underground in twisted caverns have more sensitive hearing. They have low-light vision and gain blindsight (sound) 60 feet, but they take a &ndash;4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet and take a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls against targets beyond 60 feet in bright light.</p>\n<p>This replaces low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Expanded Lung Capacity</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk have extraordinary lung capacity. These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this racial trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a vacuum, or would otherwise begin suffocating or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Forceful Mind</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Frilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS<em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Observant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this racial trait select either Perception or Sense Motive. They gain a +3 racial bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Prehensile Tail</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Vesk Venom</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this racial trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong>Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk&rsquo;s level + the vesk&rsquo;s Constitution modifier)<br /><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong>1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong>1/round for 6 rounds<br /><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong>Progression track is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Healthy}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Sluggish}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Stiffened}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.<br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>1 save.

You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GvubHqBOlV1CsWvz]{Hunter}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl10_LabelName\">You’re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks.

She quickly established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo soon proved herself in several battles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connections. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit&mdash;one with family ties to high-ranking military officials&mdash;she found herself assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for combat. When it became clear that appeals to her superiors weren&rsquo;t going to get her a better assignment, a frustrated Obozaya waited for her term to end, then left to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she&rsquo;d been searching for: an endless series of battles and adventures. Rather than signing on with a mercenary company, Obozaya found herself better suited to working with small groups of adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to her vanity and showboating style. As Obozaya&rsquo;s fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and she believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard.</p>\n<p>While Obozaya appreciates wealth, her true desire is for recognition. This is best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows who&rsquo;s coming for them. Although brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya is a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she&rsquo;s not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word. In conversations with new people, she&rsquo;s direct to the point of rudeness, and she thinks most species talk too much as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong> Obozaya can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Obozaya gains a +4 bonus to her AC against&nbsp;attacks of opportunity she provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong> Obozaya&rsquo;s unarmed attacks deal lethal damage and aren&rsquo;t considered archaic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Light Reaction Cannon</strong> This two-handed ranged weapon can be fired six times before it must be reloaded.

They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition.

You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)<br><br>The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dxdsm79r49ZhYz6x]{Compound Sight (Su)- 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways.

As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.<br><br>You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.HtcqGXQZb4M1Nh69]{Unfold Existences (Su) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary.

If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can’t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn.

This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li>\n<li><strong>6th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li>\n</ul>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":""},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"none","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Witchwarper","target":{"type":"","value":""},"uses":{"max":0,"per":"","value":0}}},{"_id":"2GjHv2YmP9Njtsdj","name":"Toughness","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/feats/toughness.webp","sort":550000,"system":{"type":"","ability":"","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":null,"value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>You have enhanced physical resilience, and harsh conditions or long exertions don’t easily tire you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Benefit</strong>: For every character level you have (and whenever you gain a new level), you gain 1 Stamina Point.

Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps, and so forth.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"dismissible":true,"duration":{"units":"","value":"1 minute/level (D)"},"formula":"","isActive":null,"level":2,"materials":{"consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0,"value":""},"modifiers":[],"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"touch","value":null},"save":{"type":"will","dc":"","descriptor":"harmless"},"school":"ill","source":"CRB pg. 362","sr":true,"target":{"type":"","value":"one creature or object no more than 10 bulk/level"},"uses":{"max":null,"per":"","value":null}}},{"_id":"Pf7jt4bnvh6RDFzo","name":"Enduring Worlds","type":"spell","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/enduring_worlds.webp","sort":125000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"action","condition":"","cost":1},"allowedClasses":{"myst":false,"tech":false,"wysh":true},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":null,"value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","concentration":false,"critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You cast this spell during the duration of an ongoing environmental effect you’ve created using your infinite worlds class feature, refining your grasp on the overlapping realities around you.

The only son of miners on a remote planetoid called Pikora 317, Zemir spent his earliest days exposed to the harsh reality of life in a corporate labor colony.</p>\n<p>Even as a toddler, Zemir&rsquo;s gaiety and thirst for new experiences were readily apparent. The vivacious boy quickly became known for his curiosity and his many troublesome talents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Around Zemir&rsquo;s fifth birthday, he became gravely ill, with a mysterious condition that left him malnourished and turned his breath sweet. After countless tests failed, the specialist Dr. Corone found the cause: the boy was transforming all of his food into his favorite treats. His parents enrolled him at the Institute for Extraordinary Minds. Here, fellow witchwarpers&mdash;like Dr. Corone&mdash;could help Zemir learn control over his abilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Near Zemir&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday, the witchwarper began the early stages of his final thesis project: an ambitious attempt to create a minute-long rift into a reality adjacent to his own. The institute&rsquo;s professors approved the project only under their strict supervision. Zemir bristled at such restrictions. He convinced three of his closest friends&mdash;Alena Nidaro, Tornil Lee, and Smidge, to join him in a dry-run of the experiment. This attempt ended in disaster, losing friends beyond the rift.</p>\n<p>Panicked, Zemir fled the Institute for Extraordinary Minds, retreating to Absalom Station. Despite the institute&rsquo;s best efforts to track Zemir down and get some answers, Dr. Corone and his colleagues have always remained one step behind. Although his wits returned, Zemir&rsquo;s scars are far from healed. He now travels to all corners of this reality, as much seeking to earn a living using his strange magic and indulge his love of new experiences as attempting to run from a guilty conscience.</p>\n<p>Growing ever more powerful daily, Zemir is a mysterious and joyful&mdash;if occasionally morose&mdash;companion to those who share his goals. The wise heed the witchwarper&rsquo;s words, for Zemir has looked into infinite realities&mdash;and vowed never to lose another companion to the fray again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Alternate Outcome (Su) </strong>Zemir can use his grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in his current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, he can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that he attempts. Alternatively, he can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against himself or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Charming Curiosity</strong> Up to twice per day, Zemir can roll twice when attempting a Diplomacy check and use the better of the two results.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Compound Sight (Su)</strong> Zemir can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted a dozen different ways. He gains a +2 bonus to Perception checks. This has already been factored into his statistics.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Diversion </strong>When he successfully uses Bluff to create a distraction, Zemir can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide himself). He can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but he takes a &ndash;5 penalty to his Bluff check for every ally after the first, and on a failed check no ally can attempt to hide.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flash Teleport (Su)</strong> As a move action, Zemir can spend 1 Resolve Point to teleport up to 30 feet. He must have line of sight to his destination. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Infinite Worlds (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into his current universe. He expends a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for 8 rounds unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, Zemir can create an instantaneous effect, such as a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules. They have a range of 180 feet and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 16 + the spell level expended to create the effect. Zemir can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed in this ability.</p>\n<p>Zemir can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When he does so, select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend. For example, Zemir could expend a 3rd-level spell slot to either create a 3rd-level effect or any combination of two 1st- or 2nd-level effects.</p>\n<p>The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by expending a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental): </strong>Zemir causes the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. Zemir can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When he creates difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 8 rounds. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a &ldquo;1&rdquo;), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental): </strong>Zemir creates a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of Zemir&rsquo;s choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental): </strong>Zemir causes the area to grant concealment against one sense&mdash;vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Resist Elements (Su) As a reaction when Zemir or a creature within 100 feet would take energy damage, he can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant the target resistance 10 against that energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This resistance is applied before the damage from the triggering attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Shift Resistance (Su) As a standard action, Zemir can change the type of a single energy resistance (but not immunity) of a creature within 100 feet (from cold to fire, for example) for 1 round. The creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate this effect. Once he&rsquo;s targeted a creature with this paradigm shift, Zemir can&rsquo;t target that creature with this paradigm shift again for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spell Focus This feat increases the saving throw DCs of Zemir&rsquo;s spells by 1. This has already been factored into his statistics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spells Zemir can cast the following spells, each as a standard action (except as noted):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charm Person</span></em>: Zemir charms a humanoid creature within 45 feet unless they succeed at a DC 18 Will save. This makes the target regard him as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target&rsquo;s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by Zemir or his allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus to its saving throw. Zemir can try to give the target suggestions, but he must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions. Any act by Zemir or his apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. Zemir must speak the creature&rsquo;s language to communicate his suggestions, or else be good at pantomiming.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charming Veneer</span></em>: Zemir can cast this spell on a creature within 180 feet. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma based skill checks. Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and a creature can only be affected by this spell once per 24 hours.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Comprehend Languages</span></em>: Zemir can understand the spoken or signed words of creatures or read incomprehensible written or tactile messages. He can read and understand an unknown language but cannot speak or write it. This lasts for 80 minutes.Detect Magic: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Enduring Worlds</span></em>: After using infinite worlds to create one or more ongoing environmental effects, Zemir can use this spell to extend the duration of the environmental effects for this spell&rsquo;s duration (8 rounds).&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Explosive Blast</span></em>: This spell creates a 20-foot-radius burst within 180 feet, dealing 9d6 fire damage to anything in the area (Reflex DC 20 half).</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fear</span></em>: When Zemir casts fear as a 2nd-level spell, it targets up to two living creatures of CR 4 within 180 feet, making them frightened for 1 minute (Will DC 19 negates). When cast as a 1st-level spell, it targets one living creature within 45 feet, making that creature frightened for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 18 negates).</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ghost Sound</span></em>: Zemir can create an illusory sound (DC 17 to disbelieve) within 45 feet that can be as loud as 20 normal humans.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Haste</span></em>: Zemir targets up to 8 creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart; these creatures are hasted for 8 rounds. When making a full attack, a hasted creature can also take a separate move action in order to move. The movement can occur before, after, or between the attacks from the full attack. All movement must occur at the same time. All of the hasted creature&rsquo;s modes of movement (including base, burrow, climb, fly, and swim speeds) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the target&rsquo;s normal speed using that form of movement.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hazard</span></em>: When Zemir casts this spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell gains that descriptor. Zemir summons a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid rain, a blast of freezing air, a static electric discharge, a burst of fire, or a roar of thunder in a 5-foot-radius burst within 45 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 17) or take 1d3 damage of the chosen type.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hold Person</span></em>: Zemir paralyzes a humanoid creature within 180 feet for 8 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. The target is aware and breathes normally but can&rsquo;t take any physical actions, even speech. A held creature can&rsquo;t cast spells. Each round on its turn, the target can spend a full action to attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Invisibility</span></em>: The creature touched is invisible for 8 minutes or until it attacks.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Probability Prediction</span></em>: This spell affects Zemir for 8 rounds when cast. At any point during the duration, he can discharge the spell to reroll any one of his d20 rolls (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, etc.). This takes no action, but you must choose to do it before you learn the results of the first roll. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Psychokinetic Hand:</span></em> Zemir points his finger at an object within 45 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less (or up to 1 bulk), gaining the ability to lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, he can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Puncture Veil:</span></em> Zemir creates microscopic tears in reality that deal 1d4 piercing damage to a creature within 180 feet. The affected creature also gains the bleeding condition (1 damage) for 3 rounds. Zemir can instead cast this spell as a full action to either target two creatures within 20 feet of each other or to target one creature and deal 2d4 piercing damage, granting the bleeding condition (2 damage) for 3 rounds.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shifting Surge</span></em>: Zemir touches a willing creature and affects one of their energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of his next turn. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Slice Reality</span></em>: Zemir targets one, two, or three creatures within 180 feet. Each target takes 2d6 damage (DC 19 Fortitude for half). If Zemir targeted only one creature, that creature is also staggered for 8 rounds.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Token Spell</span></em>: Zemir can perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. He can slowly lift one item of light bulk. He can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, such as by coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. He can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they can&rsquo;t be used as tools or weapons). He can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any effects last for the duration of the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness </strong>Zemir gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Zemir adds his character level to damage dealt with basic melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with small arms. This has already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Corona Laser Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 20 times before it needs to be reloaded. Its range increment is 90 feet.Infrared Sensors This armor upgrade grants Zemir darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jetpack </strong>Zemir gains a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) when activating his jetpack. The jetpack has a capacity of 40 charges and requires 2 charges per round when used. Zemir can also use this upgrade for &ldquo;cruising flight&rdquo; at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but he&rsquo;s flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is a standard action. A jetpack can&rsquo;t lift Zemir if he&rsquo;s encumbered.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Tempweave, Advanced</strong> While wearing this armor, Zemir can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":"6","value":"6"},"spell2":{"max":"6","value":"6"},"spell3":{"max":"3","value":"3"},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["arkanen","castrovelian","common","elven","eoxian","infernal","shirren","vesk","ysoki"]},"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft.","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Zemir L8","actorId":"bqQ1V6tqxDLgUnvC","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.<br><br>If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.<br><br>You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your class level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once. The list of mechanic tricks appears on page 71.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EE8KOT5324qTuW2o]{Overload (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.lOqPFn93aueiBQst]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AiYxJza4CVXPRjFz]{Remote Hack (Ex) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JQiKFSMXkqLMW98N]{Expert Rig (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers.<br><br>You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.D5vkMjJh78XE6KkS]{Miracle Worker (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship’s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor’s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Damaged Ship</strong>: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship’s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9H5hz8bMW0i0wz2x]{Override (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UZMGMjpAwhGZNurI]{Coordinated Assault (Ex) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NtHGqPauPZauV7rc]{Advanced Rig (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br><br>In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vaV8mCJdunfbWwQL]{Control Net (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.clTAGasLWOe1pr4D]{Ghost in the Machine (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>When using your override class feature to affect an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GLFInMDKp2fLRpsG]{Superior Rig (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.<br><br>Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JSeOqPlZUkKA1KdT]{Tech Master (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JXuSLeps7hhNuSjh]{Experimental Armor Prototype}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9hIBsMSy3PmQzgus]{Experimental Weapon Prototype (Ex)}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":false,"kas":"int","levels":1,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"fast","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 68","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"will":"slow"}},{"_id":"Qfxx0c2n5Ek7xZPN","name":"Ysoki","type":"race","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"humanoid","abilityMods":{"parts":[[2,"dex"],[2,"int"],[-2,"str"]]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>Small and furtive, the ysoki are often overlooked by larger races. Yet through wit and technological prowess, they&rsquo;ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Ranging from 3 to 4 feet tall, ysoki resemble humanoid rats who walk upright, complete with fur, long incisors, constantly twitching noses, and partially prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity. Their small, dexterous hands are perfect for working on delicate electronics, and their keen noses often allow them to identify complex chemicals by smell. Male and female ysoki are difficult for other races to tell apart, as they have similar body types and favor similar fashions.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>While the term &ldquo;ysoki&rdquo; originates from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}, where the race has long been a vibrant and respected culture, populations of ratfolk (as they&rsquo;re sometimes called) existed on several worlds for millennia before spaceflight became common. Whether these different populations were examples of convergent evolution or they shared a common ancestor is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but today most of these cultures now identify as part of the overarching ysoki race. This is due partially to the wide variation in ysoki heredity, which makes ethnicity (and often even immediate family connections) almost impossible to determine by sight or genetics, but even more so to the fact that ysoki have done more than any other ratfolk group to demand and maintain the respect of larger races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Ysoki society is chaotic and freewheeling, and a typical warren is full of half-finished projects and multiple ysoki talking over each other. Regardless of their role in society, nearly all ysoki hold a deep and abiding love for technology and gadgets, whether it be an engineer&rsquo;s love of taking machines apart or a soldier&rsquo;s appreciation for her armor&rsquo;s construction. While they traditionally take on roles and societal niches other races view as unpleasant, acting as junkers or squeezing through the innards of starships, this is due not to a lack of pride, but rather an abundance thereof&mdash;ysoki are so sure of their own worth that living in subpar conditions doesn&rsquo;t shame them. Larger races&rsquo; tendency to underestimate or pick on ysoki has left them fiercely loyal to their friends and families&mdash;both ysoki and otherwise&mdash;and a ysoki presented with a gross injustice often feels the need to fling himself teeth-first at the problem, consequences be damned. As a result, the most common ysoki alignment is chaotic good, though they can easily be tugged toward the evil alignments by loyalty or a need to strike back at perceived oppression (or even simple disrespect).</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Friendly and talented, ysoki integrate easily into most civilized societies, sometimes in all-ysoki neighborhoods and other times living side by side with alien cultures. The large size of ysoki families and their tendency to travel also means that a ysoki on a Pact World is shockingly likely to have a cousin or other contact in just about any major settlement. Of the major races, ysoki get along best with lashuntas, with whom they&rsquo;ve traded for millennia, though they appreciate humanity&rsquo;s pluck and shirrens&rsquo; devotion to community, even if the latter are a little too calm for ysoki tastes. They identify with androids&rsquo; defiance in the face of prejudice, but they find kasathas too aloof and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} too obsessed with displaying dominance. Regardless of others&rsquo; races, ysoki pride themselves on being quick judges of character, and members of many other races have been surprised to find a ysoki fighting on their behalf after no more than a conversation in a crowded bar. Quick to rile and quick to forgive, fond of laughing at misfortune (both their own and others&rsquo;), ysoki can sometimes be exhausting, but they are rarely boring.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Though ysoki form strong bonds with their friends and families, these connections are as likely to take them off-world as to keep them at home. Many curious young ysoki sign on with starship crews to see the universe or find their fortunes, and soon adopt their shipmates as a second family. Their natural aptitude with machines most often leads ysoki to become mechanics and technomancers, but they also enjoy the gloriously complicated weaponry employed by operatives and soldiers, and many appreciate the quick-witted patter of envoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Str<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>3-4 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>60-100 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>10 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>60+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are Small humanoids with the ysoki subtype.</p>\n<h2>Cheek Pouches</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can see up to 60 feet in the dark. See page 263 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Moxie</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are scrappy and nimble even when the odds are against them. A ysoki can stand from prone as a swift action. Additionally, when off-kilter (see page 276), a ysoki does not take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the flat-footed condition.

Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls&mdash;a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Androids are biomechanical constructs created in technological cr&egrave;ches called foundries. While the first androids are believed to have been mostly biological, difficult to distinguish from the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} they lived among, modern designs are more varied, and many favor metal skeletons and processors that support synthetic organs and living flesh. Nearly all androids feature a humanoid body shape and tattoo-like circuits that glow through their skin when operating at full power, but beyond this commonality, variations in physical appearance reflect an android&rsquo;s design, role, and personality. Some take pains to blend into @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} society, while others deliberately display their mechanical nature. Though some androids are constructed or customize themselves to look like other races, such models are relatively rare. Due to their biological components, androids need to eat and sleep, but as constructed beings they do not reproduce in the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} fashion and have no biological need for gender&mdash;some identify strongly as male or female, while others shift fluidly or ignore it altogether, and still others actively reject it on philosophical grounds as a relic of their former slavery.</p>\n<p>Though android bodies are assembled using tiny machines called nanites, their complex nervous systems attract and integrate souls in the same way organic creatures do. Most androids are fully grown at the time of their birth, and can technically live forever through constant repair, though most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so to allow new souls to inhabit them&mdash;a process called renewal that&rsquo;s viewed more as procreation than suicide.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Android technology in the Pact Worlds is generally believed to have developed on Golarion in the time before the Gap, though there are strong indications that the first androids there were actually travelers from a distant star system. In the modern era, various corporations throughout the Pact Worlds system unraveled the secret to android creation and began massproducing androids as cheap, skilled labor perfect for hazardous work. This practice lasted until about 150 years ago, when the Thyst Rebellion and subsequent android revolts across the system, combined with the now legendary speech known as &ldquo;The Automaton&rsquo;s Polemic&rdquo; by android revolutionary Serphaeus-6, led governments system-wide to officially recognize all androids as independent citizens. This ruling, however, has not completely stopped unscrupulous corporations in less regulated parts of the system from crafting illegal android slaves or forcing newborn androids to &ldquo;work off&rdquo; the expense of their creation. Though androids can be found anywhere in the Pact Worlds, many gravitate toward cosmopolitan @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the machine cities of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}, and the freedom of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Android society tends to be insular. While androids are treated equitably in most settlements, especially @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, many androids have not forgotten their people&rsquo;s bondage and remain keenly aware of prejudice from other races based on their &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; origin or jealousy over the androids&rsquo; freedom from aging. This leads most androids to feel a sense of kinship with others of their kind and to go out of their way to help each other, though they may also bond with members of other races who treat them well. Despite popular belief, androids&rsquo; impressive deductive reasoning abilities do not preclude sentiment, and most androids feel emotions keenly&mdash;they simply don&rsquo;t always express them well, and different individuals may have trouble processing and communicating particular feelings. The average android alignment is a practical neutrality; they are focused on their own welfare and that of their friends.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Often cautious around strangers, androids have the most strained relationship with humanity, which built them in its image and remains their most frequent oppressor. They feel closest to shirrens, who also know what it is to be enslaved and misunderstood, and respect kasathas&rsquo; self-sufficiency. They generally dislike @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, whom they see as slavers, and only grudgingly tolerate ysoki&rsquo;s antics.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Androids adventure for many reasons: to earn a living, trace the origins of their race, or rescue androids and other creatures from servitude. Their quick thinking under fire makes them natural operatives and soldiers, while their affinity for machines makes them excellent mechanics and technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>&mdash;<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>See Android entry</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Androids are Medium humanoids with the android subtype.</p>\n<h2>Constructed</h2>\n<p>For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).

Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Most androids have the standard android racial traits detailed in the&nbsp;Core Rulebook, but individuals might have unique abilities, represented by the following alternate racial traits.</p>\n<h2>Easily Augmented</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />As artificial creatures, androids are compatible with a wide array of cybernetics. Androids who have this racial trait can install one additional cybernetic augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Impersonation Matrix</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />Although most androids stand out as artificial beings, some have intricate personality matrices and physical alterations that downplay their constructed nature. Androids who have this alternate racial trait don&rsquo;t take any penalty to Disguise checks to change their appearance to a creature of a different race or type if they are disguising themselves as a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}. If the android also has the xenometric android alternate racial trait (see page 17), this benefit instead applies to Disguise checks to change appearance to that of the race chosen along with the xenometric android alternate racial trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces the +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep from the constructed trait. The android retains all the other features of the constructed trait.</p>\n<h2>Infosphere Integration</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em><br />The artificial brain an android possesses can allow better compatibility with infospheres and direct downloads of information. An android with this trait has a built-in comm unit that can be accessed without needing to use their hands. Once per day, whenever the android takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, they can choose one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill. The chosen skill becomes a class skill for them, and they gain Skill Focus as a bonus feat with that skill. This decision lasts until the next time the android uses this trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces exceptional vision.</p>\n<h2>Multilingual</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />New languages are easy for some androids to learn. An android with this racial trait knows four additional languages at 1st level. In addition, whenever such an android invests a skill rank into Culture, they learn two new languages instead of one.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Nanite Upgrade</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Specialized nanites maintain an android body, but they can be upgraded to perform additional tasks. Androids who have this racial trait gain Nanite integration as a bonus feat, ignoring the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Xenometric Android</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>COM pg. 17</em><br />Although most androids are manufactured to resemble @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, those crafted in the likenesses of other species exist. Such &ldquo;xenometrics&rdquo; possess abilities that mirror those of other races, sometimes even using hybrid tech to duplicate magic abilities.</p>\n<p>An android with this trait selects one of the species detailed in the paragraphs below. This choice cannot be changed. In addition to possessing physical features resembling those of the chosen species, the android&rsquo;s size category and reach changes to match the chosen race. In addition, xenometric androids gain some of the chosen species&rsquo; racial traits, which are noted in parentheses next to the race&rsquo;s name; these count as racial traits for the purposes of prerequisites. If a gained racial trait determines land speed, the android uses the speed as defined by that racial trait instead of that of the android. If the chosen species has a different type than humanoid, the xenometric android&rsquo;s type changes to match.</p>\n<p>Starfinder Core Rulebook options are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf} (darkvision, slow but steady), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf} (elven immunities, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} (@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} magic, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf} (adaptability, low-light vision), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} (darkvision, intimidating, self-sufficient), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling} (keen senses, sneaky, sure-footed), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} (four-armed, natural grace), lashunta (lashunta magic, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} (blindsense, limited telepathy), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} (low-light vision, natural weapons), and ysoki (cheek pouches, darkvision).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive options are dragonkin (draconic immunities, flight), formian (limited telepathy, natural weapons), haan (firespray, slow fall), kalo (kalo movement, kalo vision), maraquoi (blindsense, prehensile tail), nuar (natural weapons, swift), verthani (skill focus, skin mimic), and wrikreechee (snag, wrikreechee movement).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive 2 options are hobgoblin (fearsome, sneaky), @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} (fierce survivalist, orc ferocity), pahtra (nimble, talented), and vlaka (cold resistance, perceptive).</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Pact Worlds option is the strix (nightborn, strix mobility).</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot and exceptional vision.</p>"},"hp":{"min":1,"value":4},"modifiers":[{"_id":"3e41133e-52af-41f8-bc3c-43a97e2f98e2","name":"Constructed","type":"racial","condition":"","effectType":"saves","enabled":false,"max":2,"modifier":"2","modifierType":"formula","notes":"For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).

Around them, the dingy warehouse was completely empty, save for a pen and a note in the center of the concrete floor. Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read only: Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark. Next to the words was a drawing of a symbol&mdash;the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph&rsquo;s chest. Yet the biggest shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note&rsquo;s writer had clearly intended&mdash;for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Confused and disoriented, Iseph did as the note instructed, doing their best to disappear into Aballon&rsquo;s bustling android population. Yet the questions raised by the note continued to plague them. Who had worn their body before them? Who were they running from, and why? Eventually, Iseph began making inquiries. All of these searches failed, yet in curious ways, as if the information was being actively redacted. Worse, Iseph began to get the sense of being watched. After a month of forays into they city&rsquo;s underworld, Iseph at last tracked down someone who claimed to recognize the mark, but who insisted on meeting in person at a nearby virus bar.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Iseph was almost to the tavern when it exploded in a massive fireball, the blast consuming an entire city block.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thoroughly spooked, Iseph fled Aballon, taking passage on a ship to the Diaspora. Yet as they worked there, piloting rock-hopper shuttles and mining tugs, Iseph&rsquo;s fear turned to anger. They met android escapees from illegal colonies in the Vast, bearing blatant symbols of corporate ownership and scars from cruel disciplinary implants, and began to suspect what their own mark might say about their origins. Incensed, Iseph made contact with the Android Abolitionist Front, and under their guidance became a black ops expert. Eventually a disagreement with their handler over a messy job led Iseph to go independent. Today, Iseph hires on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport or exploratory missions&mdash;and if those jobs sometimes require a little infiltration or a bullet from the shadows, well, that costs extra.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Though paranoia often makes Iseph a loner, the android craves companionship, and is fiercely loyal to those who prove themselves trustworthy. Iseph questions or rejects many aspects of mainstream Pact Worlds culture, and enjoys exploring the countercultures on different worlds. Iseph believes the ends often justify the means, yet strives to only take on jobs that fit their sense of morality, and an initial focus on android rights has broadened into a tendency to identify with oppressed people everywhere. While Iseph finds the most joy in flying vehicles&mdash;usually fast and recklessly&mdash;their infiltration abilities remain sharp, and the former assassin has no objections to pulling out their sniper rifle when a cause is just.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloaking Field (Ex)</strong> As a move action, Iseph can activate their cloaking field, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks even when being directly observed and with no place to hide. If Iseph remains perfectly still, they gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which does not stack with invisibility) until they move. This cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, it recharges 1 round of use per minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Constructed</strong> For effects targeting creatures by type, Iseph counts as both a construct and a humanoid (whichever is worse for Iseph).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision Iseph</strong> can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Debilitating Trick (Ex) </strong>When Iseph hits an enemy with his trick attack, Iseph can choose to make that enemy either flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of Iseph&rsquo;s next turn. Iseph can instead apply the effect of interfering shot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dive for Cover</strong> When Iseph attempts a Reflex save against an area attack or area effect, they can choose to fall prone in an adjacent space in order to roll the saving throw twice, taking the better of the two results.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Evasion (Ex) </strong>If Iseph succeeds at a Reflex save against an effect that has a partial effect on a successful save, they instead suffer no effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flat Affect</strong> The DC of a Sense Motive check attempted against Iseph increases by 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Interfering Shot (Ex) </strong>Iseph adds being able to prevent a target from using reactions until the end of Iseph&rsquo;s next turn to the list of effects they can apply with the debilitating trick ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kip&nbsp;Up</strong> Iseph can stand from prone as a swift action, rather than a move action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Multi-Weapon</strong> Fighting When Iseph makes a full attack with two or more operative melee weapons or small arms, reduce the penalty to each attack from &ndash;4 to &ndash;3.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lone Wolf</strong> When attempting a check using a skill they have no ranks in as part of a role in starship combat, or to directly repair their own ship, Iseph can act as if they had 4 ranks in that skill (gaining the ability to attempt the check if the skill requires training, the +3 bonus from being trained, and the +4 bonus to the check for having 4 ranks).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong> Iseph can see in dim light as if it was normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sky Jockey</strong> When Iseph uses a device to fly, their fly speed is increased by 10 feet (this is already incorporated into the stat block). If Iseph operates a flying vehicle, its fly speed increases by 10. When they are in the pilot role of a starship, the starship&rsquo;s speed increases by 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Specialization Skill Mastery</strong> When Iseph attempts an Acrobatics or Stealth check, they can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent them from doing so.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trick Attack</strong> As a full action, Iseph can move up to 40 feet and make a single attack with a small arm (or a melee weapon with the operative special property) as a trick attack. Just before making the attack, Iseph attempts a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (whichever is better for Iseph) with a DC equal to 20 + the target&rsquo;s CR. If the skill check is successful, the attack deals 4d8 additional damage and the target is flat-footed against this attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Triple Attack</strong> When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, Iseph can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Agility (Ex)</strong> Iseph is immune to the flat-footed condition, opponents do not gain any bonuses to attack rolls for flanking Iseph or attacking when Iseph is prone, and covering fire and harrying fire to not provide any bonuses against Iseph.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Pilot (Ex) </strong>When Iseph attacks while driving a vehicle, they take only half the vehicle&rsquo;s normal penalty to their attack roll. When in a chase, Iseph gains a +2 bonus to skill checks when attempting the evade or trick pilot actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Shooter (Ex)</strong> Iseph doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with small arms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Upgrade Slot</strong> Iseph has an internal quick-release sheath normally installed in armor as an upgrade. This can store a single one-handed weapon, which Iseph can draw as a swift action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Advanced Lashunta Tempweave</strong> While wearing this armor, Iseph can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (and other harsh environments) for up to 8 days. The armor has jump jets as an upgrade, allowing Iseph to fly up to 40 feet as part of a move action. At the end of this flight, Iseph must land or they fall. Iseph can do this 10 times before the jump jets&rsquo; battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Advanced Semi-Auto Pistol</strong> This weapon fires physical bullets and can be fired 12 times before it must be reloaded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Advanced Shirren-Eye Rifle</strong> This sniper rifle fires physical projectiles and can be fired four times before it must be reloaded. It can be used to make only a single attack each round. If it is aimed as a move action and then fired as a standard action, it has a 500-foot range increment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ghost Killer Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This weapon creates damaging waves of sonic energy and can be fired 10 times before its battery must be recharged or replaced. It has been given the ghost killer infusion, which allows it to damage ethereal and incorporeal targets normally and allows incorporeal creatures to pick it up and use it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch </strong>Iseph can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Ampule of Lesser Restoration</strong> Iseph can inject this magic liquid into themselves or an unconscious or willing creature as a standard action. The subject is affected by lesser restoration, healing 1d4 temporary ability damage and eliminating the fatigued condition (or lessening the exhausted condition to fatigued).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Titanium Alloy Cable</strong> This 50-foot-long cable is designed for climbing or securing loose cargo.&nbsp;</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":3,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":3,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["common","shirren"]},"senses":"Darkvision 60 ft., Low-light vision","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Iseph L8","actorId":"jrPItmdAKakfneHO","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/iconics/Operative - Iseph.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about entertainment combat, fighting styles, and gladiatorial traditions by 5. Intimidate is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate checks.

You're famous enough that others require only a DC 15 Culture check to recognize your name and a DC 25 Culture check to recognize you out of context from your appearance alone. Because you're famous for your brutal stage presence, you can spend twice the normal amount of time when using Intimidate to bully a creature whose attitude is indifferent or better. If you do and succeed at the check, when the effect wears off, the creature's attitude toward you is worsened only to indifferent, not unfriendly.

As long as your gear is in good condition, you don't take any circumstantial penalties for wearing light armor or heavy armor in social situations (such as wearing golemforged plate to a formal event). You can use Intimidate or Profession (gladiator; Charisma) to \"hide\" up to two smaller weapons (such as a small arm or one-handed melee weapon with light bulk) or one larger melee weapon on your body, though you do not conceal the weapon so much as convince others to accept your carrying it without any objections. You can draw these weapons as normal; you do not need to spend a standard action as you would to draw a hidden weapon. Otherwise, this functions as the hide object task of Sleight of Hand.

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Str, -2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table below). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 141px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\"><strong>Entropic Strike Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":""},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"none","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":"","descriptor":"negate"},"source":"Vanguard","target":{"type":"","value":""},"uses":{"max":0,"per":"","value":0}}},{"_id":"vLNpyYpbLhwH6Ziw","name":"First Vanguard Aspect","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":424219,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.WDvGdJ5mMpAD9cWQ]{Vanguard}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics.

Members of his family worshipped Iomedae, goddess of justice and honorable battle&mdash;virtues the young lashunta gladly embraced.</p>\n<p>When Velloro reached adolescence, he became a gladiator in the VitariTech Coliseum, a venue for nonlethal combats. As Velloro moved up through the ranks, he became close with a fellow gladiator, a shobhad named Dhareen. She invited the lashunta to take the Test of the Mountain, climbing the towering moutain Ka. It was on this climb that Velloro learned to exert control over his surroundings, rebuilding the molecular lattice around him.</p>\n<p>Upon his return to the coliseum, Velloro&rsquo;s new powers earned him the nickname the Castrovel Crusher. But when his manager demanded he use these powers in lethal combat with Dhareen, he refused. Instead, Velloro turned an eye to the stars, where he knew there were others like his family&mdash;others who needed protection and assistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Aspect Embodiment (Ex)</strong> Once per combat, when Velloro hits multiple creatures in a single round with an attack or attacks (or effects that require an attack roll), he can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking an additional action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bodyguard </strong>As a reaction when an adjacent ally is attacked, Velloro can grant that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against that attack. If he does so, Velloro takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his own Armor Class until the beginning of his next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cleave </strong>Velloro can choose to take a &ndash;2 penalty to his AC until his next turn in order to make a melee attack against a foe adjacent to him as a standard action. If he hits, he can make a second melee attack against a different foe that is adjacent to both him and the first foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Draw Fire (Su)</strong> As a reaction when Velloro is in the area of an attack or effect that requires an attack roll, he can spend 1 Entropy Point to grant all allies in the area cover against that attack or effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Attunement (Su) </strong>As long as Velloro has at least 1 Entropy Point, his entropic strike ignores 8 hardness and, when his attack is a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Charge (Su)</strong> When Velloro charges, he can attempt any combat maneuver for which he has the Improved Combat Maneuver feat in place of the normal melee attack. In addition, he can forgo gaining an Entropy Point for charging to ignore the normal charge penalties to his attack and AC, and to gain the ability to charge through difficult terrain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Pool (Su)</strong> Velloro has a pool of Entropy Points (EP) that he can spend to fuel different abilities. He can have up to 6 EP in his entropic pool at a time, and he can gain EP only when involved in a combat encounter. When combat begins, Velloro gains 1 EP at the beginning of his first action; at the end of combat, he loses any Entropy Points he has remaining. He can gain EP in the following ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While he has no Entropy Points, Velloro can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>Each time he takes 16 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any effects that reduce that damage, such as energy resistance or mitigate), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If Velloro takes damage from a critical hit, he gains 1 EP, in addition to any he would gain from the attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</li>\n<li>If Velloro scores a critical hit on a significant enemy, he gains 1 EP.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If he takes a full action to charge, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If he takes two move actions on the same turn to move his speed each time, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of Velloro&rsquo;s next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to him or he designates a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If Velloro&rsquo;s entropic focus takes 16 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Velloro can expend Entropy Points in various ways, some of which come from his vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as he has at least 1 EP in his entropic pool, he gains a +1 enhancement bonus to his Armor Class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move his speed, Velloro can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it any movement type he has).</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can expend 1 EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack he makes before the start of his next turn.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He must decide how many EP to expend when he takes this move action, and he can&rsquo;t expend more than 6 EP. If the boosted entropic strike hits, he deals +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Strike (Su) </strong>This is a one-handed magical advanced melee attack with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC. Velloro does not need a free hand to make this attack. The damage dealt by this attack is acid, bludgeoning, or both. He can deliver the attack with his body or through his shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropy Shield (Su) </strong>As part of any move action or full action he takes, Velloro can create a field of condensed,entropy that forms in place on one of his limbs to protect him as a field riot shield or tactical shield (he chooses which each time he creates the shield). The shield has no bulk, but it otherwise functions in all regards as a physical shield of the selected type. Velloro can dismiss the shield as part of any move or full action he takes, and it disappears at the end of his turn if he&rsquo;s not holding it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Field Riot Shield&mdash;Velloro gains a +1 shield bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to any bull rush combat maneuvers he attempts. As a move action, he can align the shield to give himself greater protection against one opponent, increasing his shield bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent to +2 until the beginning of his next turn. He also takes a &ndash;2 penalty to skill checks affected by armor check penalties.</li>\n<li>Field Tactical Shield&mdash;This shield gives Velloro a +1 bonus to AC when wielded.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flatten Bullets (Su)</strong> When he would be hit by a ranged attack with a weapon that deals kinetic damage, Velloro can spend 1 Entropy Point as a reaction to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 the CR or level of the attacker) to take half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Great Cleave</strong> If he strikes a second target with the Cleave feat, Velloro can spend 1 Resolve Point to make a melee attack against each subsequent foe that is both adjacent to the last target and within his reach, as long as he hit the previous foe. He can&rsquo;t attack the same foe more than once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Magic</strong> Velloro has the following spell-like abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Daze</em>: This spell causes a humanoid creature of CR 3 or lower within 35 feet to be dazed for 1 round (Will DC 11 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Detect Thoughts</em>: Velloro can detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures within a 60-foot cone, and if he concentrates, he can attempt to read those thoughts (Will DC 12 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Psychokinetic Hand</em>: Once cast, as long as he concentrates (a standard action each round) Velloro can use a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. He can&rsquo;t perform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but can push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su) </strong>Velloro can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mitigate (Su)</strong> As a reaction when he takes damage, Velloro can spend 1 EP to reduce the damage he takes by 8. If he does, he can&rsquo;t gain any EP from that attack. Additionally, as a swift action, Velloro can remove any DR or energy resistance he has, or end the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases his AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for him. If he ends an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, he suspends the listed benefits until the beginning of his next turn. Additionally, whenever Velloro is first affected by an ability or spell that grants him DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, he can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Reactive (Ex)</strong> Once per day, Velloro can take up to two reactions in a single round. He can still only take one reaction per triggering event.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rugged </strong>This alternative racial trait grants the Toughness feat.Toughness Velloro gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny </strong>Agility Velloro is immune to the flat-footed condition, opponents do not gain any bonuses to attack rolls for flanking Velloro or attacking when Velloro is prone, and covering fire and harrying fire to not provide any bonuses against Velloro.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Velloro adds his character level to damage dealt with melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with operative melee weapons and small arms (though he adds his full level to his entropic strike damage rolls). This is already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Wounding Advanced Semi-Auto Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 12 times before it needs to be reloaded. It has a range increment of 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jetpack</strong> Velloro gains a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) when activating his jetpack. The jetpack has a capacity of 40 charges and requires 2 charges per round when used. He can also use this upgrade for &ldquo;cruising flight&rdquo; at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but he is flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is a standard action. A jetpack can&rsquo;t lift Velloro if he&rsquo;s encumbered.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Ringwear III</strong> While wearing this armor, Velloro can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 3 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 6d8 HP</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":8},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[{"cold":5},{"fire":5}]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"limited telepathy 30ft","value":["akiton","castrovelian","common","dwarven","elven","kasatha","shirren","shobhad","vercite","vesk","ysoki"]},"senses":"","size":"medium","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Velloro L8","actorId":"k4DWDJSxhmgRapct","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition.

As she befriended more stationers of less privilege, Navasi&rsquo;s irritation with her plutocratic parents turned to disgust. She began to dream of a fairy-tale life in which she could steal the affluent&rsquo;s unearned wealth and give it to those in need.</p>\n<p>On her eighteenth birthday, she stowed away on a ship bound for the Diaspora. Navasi arrived on Broken Rock and quickly signed up as a &ldquo;procurement specialist&rdquo; with a contracting firm called the Sixth Finger&mdash;little more than a starfaring thieves&rsquo; guild&mdash;ready to use her new position to steal from exploitative corporations and be a hero to those in need. The reality of life in a pirate enclave hit her like a meteorite. Out of money, too stubborn to return home, Navasi found she no longer had a choice in which jobs she took. Under the guildrunners&rsquo; threats, she roughed up innocents, stole from the poor, and worse. Though she never lost her egalitarian beliefs, she hardly recognized the naive idealist she&rsquo;d once been. She quickly gained a reputation as the best fast-talker around.</p>\n<p>Navasi found that the wealth from her scores brought little joy without friends to share it with, and she recruited secretly softhearted rogues to her crews. Yet it was in one particular woman that Navasi truly found herself again. Purple-haired and tattooed, the newcomer bucked the pirates&rsquo; authority and operated alone, pulling the sorts of righteous jobs Navasi had dreamed of. She was the most exciting woman Navasi had ever met, and the two became inseparable.</p>\n<p>That all came crashing down the day the Sixth Finger arranged to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. To the gang&rsquo;s leaders, the ship&rsquo;s mission&mdash;aiding refugees of a war-torn star system&mdash;was inconsequential. Navasi&rsquo;s objections were overruled.</p>\n<p>It was the final straw. Together, Navasi and her partner formulated a plan, alerting the medship to the heist and sabotaging the gang&rsquo;s starfighters. It did not go unnoticed. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi and her partner were pinned down, their backs to the sole spaceworthy ship&mdash;a single-seat fighter with only enough life support for one of them. Navasi prepared to go out in a blaze of glory&mdash;only to have her partner shove her into the cockpit and slam the canopy. As Navasi scrabbled with the latch, the other woman pulled the pins on her grenades and sprinted straight at their ambushers.</p>\n<p>The wealthy scion of Absalom Station died that day, as did the pirate she&rsquo;d become. As she made her way back to Absalom Station, knowing that neither the Sixth Finger nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook her previous incarnations. Abandoning her old identity, she took the name of her fallen love&mdash;Navasi&mdash;and swore that she&rsquo;d carry on the fight they&rsquo;d started together, stealing only from those who deserved it. Knowing she&rsquo;d need a new appearance as well, she borrowed from her partner, dyeing her jet-black hair purple and adding a single blue contact lens.</p>\n<p>Today, Navasi is a talented freelance captain, putting together crews for planetary scouting, private security, and more. Navasi still believes in freedom for all, spreading the wealth, and taking plutocrats down a peg&mdash;but she also knows the value of earning credits, and takes pride in the ability to take care of herself and her crew. As a scoundrel, a fast-talker, and a brilliant negotiator, Navasi is happiest when the chips are down and lives hang in the balance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Convincing Liar (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;When Navasi attempts a Bluff check, she can choose to not add her expertise die until after she sees the result of her d20. Once she sees the result of her d20, she can either roll and add her expertise die normally or reroll the d20 and take the better of the two d20 results (but not add her expertise die).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cultural Savant (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As long as time permits, Navasi can take 20 on Culture checks to recall knowledge even if she doesn&rsquo;t have access to a means of research.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision&nbsp;</strong>Navasi can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Diversion&nbsp;</strong>When Navasi successfully uses Bluff to create a distraction, she can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide herself). She can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but she takes a &ndash;5 penalty to her Bluff check for every ally after the first, and on a failed check, no ally can attempt to hide.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Expertise (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;If Navasi has at least 1 Resolve Point remaining when she attempts a Bluff or Sense Motive check, she can roll 1d6 and add it to the result as an insight bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Fast Talk</strong>&nbsp;If Navasi is conversing with a creature prior to the beginning of combat, and she is aware of the beginning of combat and does not begin the combat herself, she can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a Bluff check (DC = either 15 + target&rsquo;s Perception skill bonus or 20 + 1-1/2 &times; the target&rsquo;s CR, whichever is higher). On a success, the creature is considered unaware at the beginning of the combat (allowing Navasi and other aware creatures to act in a surprise round before the first full round of combat).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heads Up (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;When Navasi succeeds at a Perception check, she can signal an ally within 60 feet as a reaction so that ally can act as if he also succeeded at the Perception check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Get &rsquo;Em (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As a standard action, Navasi can make an attack against a foe, or as a move action she can select one foe within 60 feet. She must be able to see or hear the foe, and the foe must be able to see or hear her. Navasi and her allies gain a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls against that foe until the end of her next turn. She can spend 1 Resolve Point to instead add this bonus to attacks against all foes within 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Feint&nbsp;</strong>As a move action, Navasi can attempt a Bluff check against a single opponent (DC = either 10 + her opponent&rsquo;s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the opponent&rsquo;s CR, whichever is greater) to cause that opponent to be flat-footed for the next attack she makes against it before the end of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Inspiring Boost (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, Navasi can signal an ally who has taken damage since Navasi&rsquo;s last turn. The ally must be able to see and hear her and be within 30 feet. The ally gains 19 Stamina Points, up to the ally&rsquo;s normal maximum. She cannot target that ally with this ability again until the ally takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Legal Corruption</strong>&nbsp;Navasi needs to pay only 2 Fame when using the Basic Purchasing Plan boon to reduce her Infamy score (down from 4).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Unfriendly Fire</strong>&nbsp;When a foe misses Navasi with a ranged attack and she is adjacent to a different target, she can attempt a Bluff check (DC = either 10 + her attacker&rsquo;s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the attacker&rsquo;s CR, whichever is greater) as a reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack against the adjacent target. This feat can&rsquo;t be used on any creature that has seen her use it previously.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Watch Out (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;When a foe makes a ranged attack against an ally within 60 feet of Navasi, she can warn the ally as a reaction. The ally can use a reaction to gain a +4 bonus to AC against that single attack and then falls prone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Anarchic Frostbite-Class Zero Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This chaos-aligned magic weapon can be fired 20 times before its battery needs to be recharged or replaced.

Navasi can do this 10 times before the jump jets&rsquo; battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashlight&nbsp;</strong>Navasi&rsquo;s flashlight increases the light level by one step in a 20-foot cone.

This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium.

If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase.

While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below.

These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point.

Yet through wit and technological prowess, they&rsquo;ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Ranging from 3 to 4 feet tall, ysoki resemble humanoid rats who walk upright, complete with fur, long incisors, constantly twitching noses, and partially prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity. Their small, dexterous hands are perfect for working on delicate electronics, and their keen noses often allow them to identify complex chemicals by smell. Male and female ysoki are difficult for other races to tell apart, as they have similar body types and favor similar fashions.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>While the term &ldquo;ysoki&rdquo; originates from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}, where the race has long been a vibrant and respected culture, populations of ratfolk (as they&rsquo;re sometimes called) existed on several worlds for millennia before spaceflight became common. Whether these different populations were examples of convergent evolution or they shared a common ancestor is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but today most of these cultures now identify as part of the overarching ysoki race. This is due partially to the wide variation in ysoki heredity, which makes ethnicity (and often even immediate family connections) almost impossible to determine by sight or genetics, but even more so to the fact that ysoki have done more than any other ratfolk group to demand and maintain the respect of larger races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Ysoki society is chaotic and freewheeling, and a typical warren is full of half-finished projects and multiple ysoki talking over each other. Regardless of their role in society, nearly all ysoki hold a deep and abiding love for technology and gadgets, whether it be an engineer&rsquo;s love of taking machines apart or a soldier&rsquo;s appreciation for her armor&rsquo;s construction. While they traditionally take on roles and societal niches other races view as unpleasant, acting as junkers or squeezing through the innards of starships, this is due not to a lack of pride, but rather an abundance thereof&mdash;ysoki are so sure of their own worth that living in subpar conditions doesn&rsquo;t shame them. Larger races&rsquo; tendency to underestimate or pick on ysoki has left them fiercely loyal to their friends and families&mdash;both ysoki and otherwise&mdash;and a ysoki presented with a gross injustice often feels the need to fling himself teeth-first at the problem, consequences be damned. As a result, the most common ysoki alignment is chaotic good, though they can easily be tugged toward the evil alignments by loyalty or a need to strike back at perceived oppression (or even simple disrespect).</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Friendly and talented, ysoki integrate easily into most civilized societies, sometimes in all-ysoki neighborhoods and other times living side by side with alien cultures. The large size of ysoki families and their tendency to travel also means that a ysoki on a Pact World is shockingly likely to have a cousin or other contact in just about any major settlement. Of the major races, ysoki get along best with lashuntas, with whom they&rsquo;ve traded for millennia, though they appreciate humanity&rsquo;s pluck and shirrens&rsquo; devotion to community, even if the latter are a little too calm for ysoki tastes. They identify with androids&rsquo; defiance in the face of prejudice, but they find kasathas too aloof and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} too obsessed with displaying dominance. Regardless of others&rsquo; races, ysoki pride themselves on being quick judges of character, and members of many other races have been surprised to find a ysoki fighting on their behalf after no more than a conversation in a crowded bar. Quick to rile and quick to forgive, fond of laughing at misfortune (both their own and others&rsquo;), ysoki can sometimes be exhausting, but they are rarely boring.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Though ysoki form strong bonds with their friends and families, these connections are as likely to take them off-world as to keep them at home. Many curious young ysoki sign on with starship crews to see the universe or find their fortunes, and soon adopt their shipmates as a second family. Their natural aptitude with machines most often leads ysoki to become mechanics and technomancers, but they also enjoy the gloriously complicated weaponry employed by operatives and soldiers, and many appreciate the quick-witted patter of envoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Str<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>3-4 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>60-100 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>10 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>60+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are Small humanoids with the ysoki subtype.</p>\n<h2>Cheek Pouches</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action.

A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136).<br /><br />You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that&rsquo;s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object&rsquo;s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it&rsquo;s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it.<br /><br />You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler&rsquo;s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple.<br /><br />A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.</p>"},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"hands":0,"identified":false,"level":2,"modifiers":[],"price":700,"quantity":1,"source":"CRB pg. 219","usage":{"per":"","value":0}}},{"_id":"9xuE4QCErPOCQWZA","name":"Cable Line, Adamantine Alloy 50ft.","type":"technological","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/technological%20items/cable-line-adamantine-alloy.webp","sort":250000,"system":{"type":"","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"attributes":{"ac":{"value":""},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":""},"hp":{"max":"","value":6},"size":"medium","sturdy":false},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","capacity":{"max":null,"value":null},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTechItems_ctl00_LabelName\">Industrial-strength cabling is typically woven from hundreds of cords of high-durability plastic that are often coated in metal for added strength, usually adamantine or titanium alloy.&nbsp;</span></p>"},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"hands":null,"identified":true,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":500,"quantity":1,"source":"Core Rulebook","usage":{"per":"","value":null}}},{"_id":"6nebwnBp5D1OIRoj","name":"Mk 1 Ability  Crystalion (Dexterity)","type":"augmentation","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":1000000,"system":{"type":"personal","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"attributes":{"ac":{"value":""},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":""},"hp":{"max":"","value":6},"size":"medium","sturdy":false},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"identified":true,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":0,"quantity":1,"source":"","system":"none"}},{"_id":"tzm3zlwI3VHYMVEU","name":"Boost Shield (Ex)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/boost_shield.webp","sort":225000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl25_LabelName\">Your energy shield grants you a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier + double your mechanic level.

It acts after Quig&rsquo;s turn each round. If Quig takes no actions to control the drone, it can take only a standard action to attack or a move action to move up to its speed. If Quig takes a move action to control it, the drone can take a standard and move action. If Quig takes a move and swift action to control his drone, it can take a standard, move, and swift action, or a full action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Barricade&nbsp;</strong>As a move action, Quig can stack and reinforce objects too small to provide cover normally into a single adjacent square of partial cover. (The GM can rule that particularly barren areas lack the material needed to create a barricade.) If built in a square that already provided partial cover, the barricade instead provides cover. The barricade has hardness 13 and 13 Hit Points. If the barricade or a creature adjacent to it is hit by an attack, the barricade collapses 1d4 rounds later even if it has not yet been destroyed by damage. Normally there is not enough spare material to build a second barricade in the same square.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Boost Shield, Energy Shield</strong>&nbsp;As a standard action, Quig can use his expert rig to grant himself an energy shield. It gives him 20 temporary Hit Points and lasts for 8 minutes or until its Hit Points are depleted. Once he has used it, he can&rsquo;t activate it again until he takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. However, at any time he can spend 1 Resolve Point to restore all the shield&rsquo;s HP (even if it has been reduced to 0).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bypass&nbsp;</strong>Quig gains a +2 bonus to Computers and Engineering checks. This has been added to his skill bonuses above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cheek Pouches</strong>&nbsp;Quig can keep up to 1 cubic foot of items, weighing up to 1 bulk, in his cheek pouches. He can transfer a single item between his hand and a cheek pouch as a swift action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision&nbsp;</strong>Quig can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Distracting Hack</strong>&nbsp;Quig can hack a computer within 30 feet of a foe (either through normal access or using his remote hack) to cause the computer to make a loud distracting sound or visual display. This works as the feint action, but uses Quig&rsquo;s Computer skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Expert Rig</strong>&nbsp;Quig has a customized handheld toolkit he uses to hack systems and items. It functions as the appropriate tool for any Computers or Engineering checks he attempts. If it&rsquo;s destroyed, he can build a new expert rig from any technological toolkit with 1 hour of work. If Quig successfully hacks a computer with his expert rig, he can automatically disable any one security feature other than firewalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It also acts as a tier 4 computer with an artificial personality (named &ldquo;Little Scout&rdquo;). It has an audio/video recording, and can communicate with Quig&rsquo;s ship (or communicate with and give orders to Scout) at a range of 5 miles.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Combat Maneuver (Disarm, Grapple)&nbsp;</strong>When Quig attempts a disarm or grapple combat maneuver, he gains a +4 bonus to his attack roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Miracle Worker</strong>&nbsp;Once per day as a move action, Quig can perform an amazing feat of engineering for a starship, armor, or weapon he can access. For a suit of armor, this increases its AC by 2 for 1 minute. A weapon gains a +2 bonus to its attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. For a starship, Quig restores a number of Hull Points equal to the starship&rsquo;s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship&rsquo;s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, he can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Moxie&nbsp;</strong>Quig can stand from prone as a swift action. When off-kilter, he does not take the normal penalties for that condition and is not flat-footed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overcharge&nbsp;</strong>As a standard action, Quig can use his expert rig to overcharge and fire an energy weapon (or melee weapon with the powered special property) in his possession, or as a move action he can overcharge a touched weapon (which is then overcharged for its next attack made before the end of Quig&rsquo;s next turn). An overcharged weapon&rsquo;s attack deals an additional 2d6 damage and uses three times as many charges as a typical attack with the weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overload&nbsp;</strong>As a standard action, Quig can overload an adjacent technological item, such as a powered weapon or armor upgrade (though not a creature, or an object larger than Medium size). The item does not function for 1 round. If the item is in a foe&rsquo;s possession, that creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to negate this effect. Once a device is overloaded, a static charge prevents the object from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Remote Hack</strong>&nbsp;Quig can use his expert rig to attempt Computers and Engineering checks at a range of 30 feet. A target of this ability (or someone observing the target) can attempt a DC 26 Perception or Sense Motive check to know Quig is the source of the remote hack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Swift Hunter</strong>&nbsp;Quig can use Diplomacy to gather information about a single creature in half the normal time, and he takes no penalty to Survival checks to follow tracks when moving at full speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Theme Knowledge</strong>&nbsp;Quig can select a specific sentient creature that he can identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be his mark. He reduces the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks to recall knowledge about his mark, as well as about law-enforcement individuals and practices. If he knows his mark by an alias, he can recall only knowledge associated with that alias.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong>&nbsp;Quig gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Corona Laser Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This pistol can be fired 20 times before its battery must be recharged or replaced. Quig has two extra batteries, which can be used in this or Scout&rsquo;s weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Detonator&nbsp;</strong>A detonator can be wired to an explosive in 1 minute, and set to detonate the explosive within 500 feet with the push of a button (no action if done on Quig&rsquo;s turn, or a reaction), a command code (a move action) or a complex action such as a retinal scan (a full action). The detonator can be used 5 times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Explosives&nbsp;</strong>Quig has a number of explosives designed to work with his detonator. These have the same cost, weight, and effect as grenades, but must be activated with a detonator rather than thrown. He has one frag III (explode [15 ft., 4d6 P, DC 18]), two stickybomb II explosives (explode [15 ft., entangled 2d4 rounds, DC 15]), and two flash I explosives (explode [5 ft., blinded 1d4 rounds, DC 15]).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Grappler&nbsp;</strong>The grappler is attached to 50 feet of adamantine alloy cable line, and can be climbed as easily as a knotted rope. It can also be attached to an immobile object at least 5 feet wide with a ranged attack (+10) against AC 5. Against a smaller or moving object, attaching it requires a ranged attack against KAC + 8. If it&rsquo;s attached to a creature, this is a grapple combat maneuver, but the creature can still use all its limbs and is only prevented from moving farther away than the length of the cable. The grappler can be pried loose with a successful Athletics check with a DC equal to Quig&rsquo;s attack roll to attach it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kasatha Microcord III&nbsp;</strong>While wearing this armor, Quig can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days. Its jetpack allows him to fly with a speed of 30 feet. It has a capacity of 40, and Quig can use 1 charge per minute to fly in cruising mode (causing him to be flat-footed and off-target), or expend 2 charges per round to fly without those conditions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong>&nbsp;Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Ampoule of Make Whole</strong>&nbsp;Quig can inject this spell ampoule into Scout (or another construct) to restore 5d6 Hit Points to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","weight":""},"cl":{"value":null},"class":"","deity":"","environment":"","level":{"max":20,"min":1,"value":1},"organization":"","race":"","theme":"","xp":{"max":1300,"min":0,"value":0}},"modifiers":[],"resources":{"primary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"secondary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0},"tertiary":{"lr":0,"max":0,"sr":0,"value":0}},"skillpoints":{"max":0,"tooltip":[],"used":0},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"blu":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":null,"value":0},"com":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"cul":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"dis":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"eng":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"int":{"ability":"cha","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"lsc":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"mys":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"per":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"phs":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"pil":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"pro":{"ability":"int","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"subname":"","value":3},"sen":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"sle":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":8,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","enabled":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"min":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"ranks":41,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell1":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell2":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell3":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell4":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell5":{"max":0,"value":0},"spell6":{"max":0,"value":0}},"traits":{"armorProf":{"custom":"","value":[]},"ci":{"custom":"","value":[]},"damageReduction":{"negatedBy":"","value":0},"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dv":{"custom":"","value":[]},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["akiton","brethedan","common","kasatha","shirren","ysoki"]},"senses":"Darkvision 60ft","size":"small","sr":0,"weaponProf":{"custom":"","value":[]}}},"token":{"name":"Quig L8","actorId":"mqCHHZCAPO2vkbej","actorLink":false,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":0,"displayName":0,"disposition":1,"flags":{},"height":1,"img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/iconics/Mechanic - Quig.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":360,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":360,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1}}

Given your propensity for trying new things, you’ve also found it prudent to understand the distinction between delightful experiences and those that are ill-advised, permanently injurious, or even fatal. Reduce the DC of Life Science checks by 5 when identifying consumables such as drugs, medicinals, poisons, food, and drink.<br>Perception is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Perception checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CHARMING CURIOSITY (6TH)</h2>\n<p>Your broad awareness provides you with insight when you try to influence people. This talent is valuable when you try to talk others into allowing you access to new experiences. Strangers might not understand your motivations, but your passion is contagious, and your ardent quest endears you to those who share your curiosity. Up to twice per day, you can roll twice when attempting a Diplomacy check and use the better of the two results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>FLASH OF COURAGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">12TH)</span></h2>\n<p>Though you want to have as many new experiences as you can, some encounters are so intimidating or dangerous that even you hesitate. After all, if a thrill resulted in serious injury or even death, it’s possible you could never feel a new sensation again! Despite the risk, you refuse to let fear stop you from seeing as much of the galaxy as your limits allow. You’ve successfully survived each moment of your life so far, haven’t you? With such an optimistic outlook toward the future, you gain a +1 morale bonus to Will saving throws against fear effects. In addition, once per day when you are affected by a fear effect, as a reaction, you can delay the onset of that effect for 1 round. Once the fear starts to affect you, it then has its normal duration from that point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SENSATION JUNKY (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>New experiences fulfill and exhilarate you, stoking your enthusiasm for the wondrous galaxy you inhabit, the opportunities it presents, and all it has to offer. Twice per day, you can enjoy a new experience that takes 10 minutes or longer. As an alternative, you can spend 10 minutes or longer processing a recent new experience in some way. You might make a digital record or write in a physical journal, discuss the experience, debate whether you’d repeat it, bask in the satisfaction of fulfilling your curiosity, or engage in similar reflection. If you do so, you regain 1 Resolve Point. The time spent reflecting on your experience doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina.</p>"},"modifiers":[],"skill":"per","source":"COM page 14"}},{"_id":"msQlgS1bTMxeqoCt","name":"Human","type":"race","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"humanoid","abilityMods":{"parts":[[2,"any"]]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond than any of their neighbor races&mdash;for better and for worse. They&rsquo;ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans&rsquo; tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion&rsquo;s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward&mdash;who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it&rsquo;s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there&rsquo;s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves&mdash;a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment&mdash;though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans&mdash;if only because humans&rsquo; tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own&mdash;and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments&nbsp;</strong>+2 to any one ability score<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feat</h2>\n<p>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Skilled</h2>\n<p>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />The cultural, genetic, and mystical influences that some humans are subjected to can produce racial traits different from the norm.</p>\n<h2>Adopted</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em><br />Many humans thrive in racially diverse metropolitan areas, and some individuals are adopted by members of a different species.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place.

You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot.

You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe.

You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level.

This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

He gains a +1 bonus to Perception checks. This has already been factored into his statistics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Infinite Worlds (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into his current universe. He expends a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for 4 rounds unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, Zemir can create an instantaneous effect, such as a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules. They have a range of 140 feet and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + the spell level expended to create the effect. Zemir can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.</p>\n<p>Zemir can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When he does so, select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend. For example, Zemir could expend a 2nd-level spell slot to either create a 2nd-level effect or any two 1st-level effects.The environmental and instantaneous effects he can create by expending a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental): </strong>Zemir causes the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. Zemir can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When he creates difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 4 rounds. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a &ldquo;1&rdquo;), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental): </strong>Zemir creates a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. Zemir selects the damage type each time he uses this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous): </strong>Zemir causes a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of Zemir&rsquo;s choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Shift Resistance (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can change the type of a single energy resistance (but not immunity) of a creature within 100 feet (from cold to fire, for example) for 1 round. The creature can attempt a DC 17 Will save to negate this effect. Once he&rsquo;s targeted a creature with this paradigm shift, Zemir can&rsquo;t target that creature with this paradigm shift again for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Focus</strong> This feat increases the saving throw DCs of Zemir&rsquo;s spells by 1. This has already been factored into his statistics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Zemir can cast the following spells, each as a standard action (except as noted):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charm Person</span></em>: Zemir charms a humanoid creature within 35 feet unless they succeed at a DC 17 Will save. This makes the target regard him as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target&rsquo;s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by Zemir or his allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus to its saving throw. Zemir can try to give the target suggestions, but he must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions. Any act by Zemir or his apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. Zemir must speak the creature&rsquo;s language to communicate his suggestions, or else be good at pantomiming.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charming Veneer</span></em>: Zemir can cast this spell on a creature within 140 feet. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and a creature can only be affected by this spell once per 24 hours.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Comprehend Languages</span></em>: Zemir can understand the spoken or signed words of creatures or read incomprehensible written or tactile messages. He can read and understand an unknown language but cannot speak or write it. This lasts for 40 minutes.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Detect Magic</span></em>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fear</span></em>: When Zemir casts fear as a 2nd-level spell, it targets one living creature of CR 4 within 140 feet, making that creature frightened for 1 minute (Will DC 18 negates). When cast as a 1st-level spell, it targets one living creature within 35 feet, making that creature frightened for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 17 negates).Ghost Sound: Zemir can create an illusory sound (DC 16 to disbelieve) within 35 feet that can be as loud as 20 normal humans.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hazard</span></em>: When Zemir casts this spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell gains that descriptor. Zemir summons a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid rain, a blast of freezing air, a static electric discharge, a burst of fire, or a roar of thunder in a 5-foot-radius burst within 35 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 16) or take 1d3 damage of the chosen type.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Psychokinetic Hand</span></em>: Zemir points his finger at an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less (or up to 1 bulk), gaining the ability to lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, he can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Puncture Veil</span></em>: Zemir creates microscopic tears in reality that deal 1d4 piercing damage to a creature within 140 feet. The affected creature also gains the bleeding condition (1 damage) for 3 rounds. Zemir can instead cast this spell as a full action to either target two creatures within 20 feet of each other or to target one creature and deal 2d4 piercing damage, granting the bleeding condition (2 damage) for 3 rounds.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shifting Surge</span></em>: Zemir touches a willing creature and affects one of their energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of his next turn. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Slice Reality</span></em>: Zemir targets either one or two creatures within 140 feet. Each target takes 2d6 damage (DC 18 Fortitude for half). If Zemir targeted only one creature, that creature is also staggered for 4 rounds.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Token Spell</span></em>: Zemir can perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. He can slowly lift one item of light bulk. He can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, such as by coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. He can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they can&rsquo;t be used as tools or weapons). He can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any effects last for the duration of the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness </strong>Zemir gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Zemir adds his character level to damage dealt with basic melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with small arms. This has already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic Lashunta Tempweave</strong> While wearing this armor, Zemir can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.Infrared Sensors This armor upgrade grants Zemir darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Static Arc Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 10 times before it needs to be reloaded (each shot uses 2 battery charges).

Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds&mdash;for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they&rsquo;ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate &ldquo;softer&rdquo; races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails&mdash;while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony &ldquo;beards&rdquo; that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that&rsquo;s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk&rsquo;s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who&rsquo;ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn&rsquo;t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding&mdash;especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk&rsquo;s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict&mdash;often called the Silent War&mdash;might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids&rsquo; dispassionate consistency, kasathas&rsquo; sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture&rsquo;s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-8 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>200-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>16 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>Armor Savant</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology. When wearing armor, they gain a +1 racial bonus to AC. When they&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor, their armor check penalty is 1 less severe than normal.</p>\n<h2>Fearless</h2>\n<p>Vesk receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Vesk can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p>Vesk can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1&ndash;1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate racial traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>Brawny</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Cave Senses</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Vesk who grew up underground in twisted caverns have more sensitive hearing. They have low-light vision and gain blindsight (sound) 60 feet, but they take a &ndash;4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet and take a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls against targets beyond 60 feet in bright light.</p>\n<p>This replaces low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Expanded Lung Capacity</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk have extraordinary lung capacity. These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this racial trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a vacuum, or would otherwise begin suffocating or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Forceful Mind</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Frilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS<em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Observant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this racial trait select either Perception or Sense Motive. They gain a +3 racial bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Prehensile Tail</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Vesk Venom</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this racial trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong>Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk&rsquo;s level + the vesk&rsquo;s Constitution modifier)<br /><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong>1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong>1/round for 6 rounds<br /><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong>Progression track is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Healthy}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Sluggish}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Stiffened}&mdash;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.<br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>1 save.

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br><br>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br><br>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.<br><br><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)<br><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.XEZ8TnivxFRh1ooE]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency.

When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UVNOjH2ERlQjcGnU]{Zenith Revelation - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br><br>Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a –5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br><br>In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":7},"isCaster":false,"kas":"cha","levels":4,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":true,"bmelee":true,"gren":false,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"CRB, p. 100","sp":{"min":1,"value":7},"will":"fast"}},{"_id":"jYIBJkZgVgx6mJT9","name":"Kasatha","type":"race","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":100000,"system":{"type":"humanoid","abilityMods":{"parts":[[2,"str"],[2,"wis"],[-2,"int"]]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>Originally from a planet orbiting a dying star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed kasathas maintain a reputation as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others.

The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides.

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level. <br><br>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon’s damage. <br><br>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat).

A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"

The solarian can place the crystal inside his mote as a standard action. While within a mote, a crystal applies its effects any time that mote is in a solar weapon form. A crystal within a mote can&rsquo;t be interacted with in any way other than via abilities that specifically target a mote. The solarian can remove the crystal from his mote as a standard action, and the crystal falls loose if the mote is deactivated in any way. A solarian can&rsquo;t have more than one crystal in his mote at a given time.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal doesn&rsquo;t give a solarian the option to create a solar weapon if he did not choose that option for his solar manifestation. Most weapon crystals increase the amount of damage attacks with the solar weapon deal. This increased damage is normally the same type of damage the solarian weapon deals (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). If a solarian crystal&rsquo;s damage entry lists an abbreviation after the damage, however, the additional damage the solar weapon deals is of the indicated type.</p>\n<p>Even if a solarian weapon crystal&rsquo;s extra damage is a type of energy damage, attacks with the solar weapon still target KAC, not EAC. If a solarian crystal lists a critical effect, that critical effect applies to any critical hit the solar weapon makes while the solarian crystal is within the solarian&rsquo;s mote. For example, a solarian with a minor photon crystal and a base solar weapon damage of 2d6 deals 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, plus 1d6 fire damage, on a hit with his solar weapon.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal is a hybrid item that blends magic and technology. When a weapon crystal is within a mote and the solarian uses the mote in solar weapon form, the solar weapon is considered magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broken Solarian Crystals</strong>: If a solarian weapon crystal with the broken condition is inside a solarian&rsquo;s solar mote, the solarian takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack and damage rolls with the solar weapon, and the solar weapon can&rsquo;t deal extra critical effects. Both effects last until the crystal is repaired. As hybrid items, solarian crystals can be repaired using the make whole or mending spells, or with the Engineering or Mysticism skills, as described in the Skills chapter.</li>\n</ul>"},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"hands":0,"identified":true,"level":5,"modifiers":[{"_id":"0e1d8c67-c8eb-45c2-8644-3d6ba5521aff","name":"Graviton Crystal,

respected family on the kasatha generation-ship-turned-homeland Idari, and he trained to be an adata&mdash;one of the scholar-priests who oversee the removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasathas. Yet while Altronus was an excellent scholar, he had trouble focusing on a single topic for long. Inevitably, some interesting fact in his studies would pique his interest and draw his research off into unrelated sidetracks. This broad, self-directed education made him adept at making connections between disparate fields, yet earned him little love from traditionalist teachers.</p>\n<p>One of Altronus&rsquo;s more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, the guiding philosophy of the solarians. Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery and taught to draw strength and focus from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and soon was among the most advanced students. Yet Altronus was still slated for a career as an adata, and relished being allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship&rsquo;s famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms of stasis pods where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasathan brains could be experienced.</p>\n<p>During one of his shifts, Altronus was assigned to an inactive Sensorium access node. Though most such shifts were uneventful, on that night Altronus was surprised by the appearance of a senior adata, Remura Esolla Kaiban of Clan Senthen, flashing a warrant to allow unscheduled access to the memory of a recently deceased citizen. Thanks to his tendency to collect trivia, Altronus knew Kaiban was scheduled to be giving a lecture at the far end of the Idari. What, he wondered, could be so important that the revered adata would end the lecture early?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Altronus knew he should mind his own business, but instead contacted a friend at the far end of the ship, who informed him that not only had Adata Kaiban not left the lecture early&mdash;she was still on the stage.</p>\n<p>Immediately Altronus sounded an intruder alert, and rushed to confront the false adata. To his surprise, Altronus discovered not a kasatha, but a small, sickly, gray humanoid with long wires latched onto the Sensorium feed. Altronus leapt to activate the Sensorium emergency disconnect, but the creature attacked. Through the resulting haze of pain, Altronus managed to seal the access node&rsquo;s security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside.</p>\n<p>Unarmed, Altronus had little chance of holding the intruder at bay and no way to heal his wounds. For the first time in his life, Altronus confronted the fact that he was going to die. Like the stars themselves, he too would be extinguished, his body breaking down and being reincorporated over millennia into new worlds and stars. At last, he truly understood the&nbsp; Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it. And the universe answered.</p>\n<p>Altronus was as surprised as the strange alien to find a long, shining golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm. Yet he had seen enough solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy, and leapt to place himself between the creature and the node&rsquo;s access panels. The two fought in grim silence. Outmatched, Altronus knew he didn&rsquo;t need to win&mdash;only to buy time, keeping the creature from finishing its infiltration until help arrived.</p>\n<p>At last, ship security arrived, dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien toggled a device on its arm&mdash;and detonated its own head like a bomb.</p>\n<p>The security team questioned Altronus. When several true adata arrived, they immediately attempted to pull meaning from the alien brain-splatter, recovering two ideas: that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds, and that something important called &ldquo;Phase Three&rdquo; was approaching.</p>\n<p>The Doyenate of the Idari was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes. While the matter was officially left open to investigation, official attention quickly turned elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But Altronus couldn&rsquo;t let the issue lie. As it came time for Altronus to begin his Tempering, he realized he could never accept a role as an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him. He left the Idari, vowing to chase down every strange occurrence until he unraveled the alien conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now an adult, Altronus has remained on his Tempering for much longer than the traditional year. He often signs on with adventuring companies as a guard, researcher, or scout in order to support himself, yet his primary goal always remains researching the shadowy web of plots he first glimpsed that night in the access node. Ironically, while he comes across to many kasathas as impetuous and offbeat, his natural kasathan love of traditions, devotion to the Cycle, and scholar&rsquo;s desire to monologue about his research often causes members of other races to see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist. Any skepticism as to his usefulness, however, disappears in the first firefight, as Altronus launches himself into the fray and &ldquo;lets the cosmos take control,&rdquo; slicing through hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Black Hole (Su)</strong> When fully attuned to graviton mode, as a standard action Altronus can pull any number of creatures he targets that are within 20 feet of him toward him. Each target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or move 5 feet closer. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. After using this power, he becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blind-Fight</strong> When Altronus misses a melee attack because of concealment, he can reroll his miss chance once to see if he actually hit. He is not flat-footed against melee attacks from creatures he cannot see, can withdraw from creatures he cannot see, and doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt an Acrobatics check to move at full speed while blinded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong> As a move action, Altronus can gain DR 1/&mdash; for 1 round. When Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, he can instead gain DR 2/&mdash;, and the DR lasts as long as he remains graviton-attuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision</strong> Altronus can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Desert Stride</strong> Altronus can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at his normal rate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Four-Armed</strong> Altronus has four arms, all of which can wield and carry items normally, though this does not affect how many attacks he can make each round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Plasma Sheath</strong> As a move action, Altronus can cause all his solar weapon damage to become fire damage (though attacks still target KAC) for 1 round. If he is attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, he also increases the damage dealt by 2, and the effect lasts as long as he maintains stellar attunement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sidereal Influence</strong> Outside of combat, Altronus can tap into stellar influences to assist in him various tasks. He must meditate for 1 minute and then chooses either Diplomacy or Stealth. He adds a +1d6 insight bonus to checks with the selected skill until he enters combat, falls unconscious, sleeps, or meditates to choose another skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Solar Manifestation (Solar Weapon) </strong>Altronus has a mote of yellow light that orbits him. He can grab this and turn it into a solar weapon with the same ease as drawing a weapon. It is considered a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals 1d6 slashing damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Stellar Mode</strong> At the beginning of Altronus&rsquo;s first round in a combat, he must choose one of three modes, graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. If graviton- or photon-attuned, he gains 1 attunement point for the appropriate mode. Each round, he either maintains that mode (gaining another point of attunement, to a maximum of 3), or becomes unattuned (losing all attunement points, and he can then enter a new mode on the following turn). If Altronus has 1 or 2 points in a mode, he is attuned to that mode. If he has 3 points in a mode, he is fully attuned to that mode. Some of his abilities function only when he is attuned or fully attuned to the graviton or photon mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When attuned in graviton mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to his Reflex saves.</li>\n<li>When attuned in photon mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Supernova (Su) </strong>When Altronus is fully attuned to photon mode, as a standard action he can deal 5d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex DC 13 half). After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Beacon </strong>This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 50-foot radius. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Defrex Hide</strong> While wearing this armor, Altronus can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.

They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens&mdash;races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they&rsquo;re ready to write all @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>120-200 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>25 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>Desert Stride</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>Four-Armed</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br><br>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br><br>If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2BjD4ocSE0BL5DcN]{Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study.

At 9th level, that bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3.<br><br>When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon.

You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast raise dead or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage. The target takes 17d10 points of damage and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier), the damage is halved, and the target is instead only fatigued for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Relieve the target of debilitating conditions. Choose one set of ability scores: mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) or physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The target is healed of all ability damage to the chosen set of ability scores, and all ability drain from these ability scores is removed. Regardless of which set of scores you choose, the superserum also eliminates any ongoing confusion, fear, and insanity effects; any mental afflictions that could be removed with dispel magic; and any diseases that use the mental disease track. It removes any effects magically altering the target’s memory—even instantaneous effects—and can restore the target’s memory to perfect clarity.</li>\n</ul>"},"fort":"fast","hp":{"min":1,"value":6},"isCaster":false,"kas":"int","levels":4,"modifiers":[],"proficiencies":{"armor":{"hvy":false,"lgt":true,"pwr":false,"shl":false},"weapon":{"amelee":false,"bmelee":true,"gren":true,"hweap":false,"larms":false,"sarms":true,"snipe":false,"spec":false}},"ref":"slow","skillRanks":{"min":4,"value":4},"source":"COM, p. 40","sp":{"min":1,"value":6},"will":"slow"}},{"_id":"tg9udPSW50RkvN5S","name":"Baton, tactical","type":"weapon","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-simple.webp","sort":200000,"system":{"type":"","ability":"str","abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"mwak","activation":{"type":"none","condition":"","cost":null},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"none","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"attributes":{"ac":{"value":"5"},"customBuilt":false,"dex":{"mod":""},"hardness":{"value":"7"},"hp":{"max":"18","value":18},"size":"medium","sturdy":true},"attuned":false,"bulk":"L","capacity":{"max":null,"value":null},"chatFlavor":"","container":{"contents":[],"isOpen":true,"storage":[]},"critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[{"formula":"1d4 + @abilities.str.mod","operator":"","types":{"bludgeoning":true}}]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>A baton is a thin, solid metal shaft, usually with a textured rubber grip.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br><br>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit.

You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br><br>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Biohacker","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}},{"_id":"3Ix7Qj7s2J0JAZCb","name":"Primary Field Of Study (Ex)","type":"feat","effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","sort":400000,"system":{"type":"","ability":null,"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"actionType":"","activation":{"type":"","condition":"","cost":0},"area":{"effect":"","shape":"","units":"","value":null},"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"effect":"","parts":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.PSHcGB4UFgMSiF4V]{Biohacker}</p>\n<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty.

She can use it to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks described below.</p>\n<p>Her custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer (granting a +4 bonus on Engineering, Mysticism, and Physical Science checks to identify unknown drugs, medicinals, poisons, and other chemical substances). As long as she has her custom microlab, as a move action she can target a creature within 60 feet in her line of sight and attempt a special skill check to identify it as though her die roll were a 20, using Life Science for a living creature or Physical Science for an unliving one, with the check&rsquo;s DC determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity (page 133 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Barsala can also attune her custom microlab to 7 individual creatures. This takes 10 minutes, which she can combine with the time needed to prepare her biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If she attunes her microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond her maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be reattuned. Under some circumstances, Barsala can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.</p>\n<p>If her custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, Barsala can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. She can have only one custom microlab at a time. If she creates a new one, her old microlab functions as a normal item of whatever type she made it from.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Biohacks (Ex) </strong>Barsala can use biohacks to boost her allies or inhibit her foes. Her biohacks produce their effects only when she injects a creature with them (see below), and only she knows how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves Barsala&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until she picks it up again.</p>\n<p>Barsala can deliver any biohack she creates with any attack from an injection weapon. She must decide to use a biohack prior to the attack roll and specify which effect she&rsquo;s using. She applies the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. She does not need to preload her weapon with biohacks. If she makes a ranged attack and misses, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If Barsala&rsquo;s attack with a biohack hits but deals no damage, the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, Barsala can remove or change which biohack she&rsquo;s using as part of her next attack without taking any additional action.She can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (a level 4 consumable basic melee weapon from her custom microlab) that she can wield in one hand. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, Barsala must hit the creature with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.</p>\n<p>Barsala can inject a biohack into a willing or unconscious creature (or herself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within her reach. She can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally she has attuned her custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within 60 feet. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p>The materials Barsala uses to create biohacks are inert until she activates them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks she knows. Each day after she has rested for 8 hours, Barsala can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create 5 biohacks, and this is the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; Barsala doesn&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks she&rsquo;s creating until performing the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in her possession. Barsala can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost. Whenever she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, Barsala can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those she has used, up to her maximum.</p>\n<p>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. Barsala knows the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by her primary field of study (see below).</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Booster </span></em>- A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for 4 rounds unless it states otherwise. When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basic Inhibitor </span></em>- A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature&rsquo;s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for 6 rounds unless it states otherwise. When Barsala uses it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s DR by 5.</li>\n<li>Barsala reduces the target&rsquo;s resistance to one type of energy (her choice) by 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of her basic inhibitors at a time, though it can be affected by multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If Barsala affects a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minor Biohacks </span></em>- Barsala can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and she can add them to any attack she makes with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. She doesn&rsquo;t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks she can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minor Booster:</span></em> Using a minor booster biohack allows Barsala to attempt to administer first aid with a Medicine check on targets within 60 feet of her microlab. This doesn&rsquo;t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack, and it doesn&rsquo;t have the duration of normal biohacks. Alternatively, she can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minor Inhibitor</span></em>: A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance; the target takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls for 7 rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Field of Study, Genetics (Ex) </strong>Barsala has selected the genetics field of study, granting her access to a unique booster and inhibitor:</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Booster </span></em>- Barsala temporarily boosts a living creature to improve the acuity of its hearing, granting the subject the benefits of blindsense (sound) with a range of 60 feet. If the creature already has blindsense, it instead gains the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. This benefit lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inhibitor </span></em>- Barsala delivers a DNA-twisting or material-altering chemical nanite compound into a creature&rsquo;s body, imparting vulnerability to one type of energy (her choice). If the creature is immune to that energy type, this inhibitor temporarily removes that immunity and gives the creature resistance 20 to that type of energy. If the creature has resistance to that energy type, this effect instead reduces its resistance by 10 (minimum 0). This biohack does not remove a creature&rsquo;s resistance or immunity to natural hazards or environments, only to damage from energy attacks, spells, and other abilities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Injection Expert (Ex) </strong>Barsala is proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property from a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Barsala hits an ally with such a weapon, she can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When she fires a weapon with the injection special property and has multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, she chooses which type of ammunition she fires when she makes the attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility</strong> Barsala gains a +4 bonus to her Armor Class against attacks of opportunity that she provokes by leaving a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Painful Injection</strong> Barsala adds half her Wisdom modifier (+2) to her damage rolls with injection weapons. This has already been factored into her attacks above.Spark of Ingenuity (Ex) Once per day, Barsala can alter one of her biohacks to work in a different way. When using a booster biohack, she can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster&rsquo;s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. Alternatively, she can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of her inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Treat Condition (Ex)</strong> As a standard action, Barsala can treat a willing, adjacent creature to remove the shaken, sickened, or staggered condition. This doesn&rsquo;t end the effect that caused the condition, and the target can regain the condition from any source as normal. Barsala can use this ability up to 4 times per day. She regains all expended uses of this ability when she takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Barsala adds her character level to damage dealt with melee weapons and half her character level to damage dealt with operative melee weapons, small arms, and weapons with the injection ability. This is already added to her attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Amblaree </strong>This is a poison with the following properties: Type poison (injury); Save Fortitude DC 13; Track Wisdom (special); Frequency 1/round for 3 rounds; Effect progression track is Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Blinded; no end state.

You're famous enough that others require only a DC 15 Culture check to recognize your name and a DC 25 Culture check to recognize you out of context from your appearance alone. Because you're famous for your brutal stage presence, you can spend twice the normal amount of time when using Intimidate to bully a creature whose attitude is indifferent or better. If you do and succeed at the check, when the effect wears off, the creature's attitude toward you is worsened only to indifferent, not unfriendly. At the GM's discretion, a die-hard fan's attitude might be worsened to friendly instead, or you might be able to use this ability against an unfriendly target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PART OF THE OUTFIT (12TH)</h2>\n<p>Your name is synonymous with your gladiatorial persona and outfit. As long as your gear is in good condition, you don't take any circumstantial penalties for wearing light armor or heavy armor in social situations (such as wearing golemforged plate to a formal event). You can use Intimidate or Profession (gladiator; Charisma) to \"hide\" up to two smaller weapons (such as a small arm or one-handed melee weapon with light bulk) or one larger melee weapon on your body, though you do not conceal the weapon so much as convince others to accept your carrying it without any objections. You can draw these weapons as normal; you do not need to spend a standard action as you would to draw a hidden weapon. Otherwise, this functions as the hide object task of Sleight of Hand.

Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Str, -2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Time and again, Velloro proved a fierce protector of his family, putting himself between them and the many dangers of their dying world.</p>\n<p>When Velloro reached adolescence, he developed into the korasha clade of his species, packing on muscle and becoming rather headstrong. His years of junkyard scrapping pointed him toward one obvious direction in Akiton&rsquo;s limited job market: he became a gladiator in the VitariTech Coliseum, a new sporting venue that hosted nonlethal gladiatorial combats.</p>\n<p>As Velloro moved up through the ranks of other local combatants, he also became close with a fellow gladiator, a shobhad named Dhareen. She saw potential in the young competitor, and after defeating Velloro in a particularly important match, Dhareen invited the dejected lashunta to take the Test of the Mountain. In this shobhad tradition, travelers climb to the summit of Ka, the tallest mountain in the Pact Worlds. Velloro accepted the challenge.</p>\n<p>While climbing Ka, the charismatic and sociable Velloro experienced something entirely new and, at first, unpleasant: loneliness. Yet as his isolation grew, so too did his connection to the mountain. One night, while taking shelter from a violent storm, Velloro felt a strange acceptance and calm wash over him. As he did, he noticed the whirling mixture of ashy sleet around him turn to a gentle eddy. With sudden clarity, Velloro remembered dozens of instances earlier in his life when he had subtly affected the state of matter around him&mdash;events he had dismissed as coincidence or figments of his imagination. Invigorated, the lashunta began to intentionally exert control over his surroundings, structuring and deconstructing the molecular lattice all around him</p>\n<p>Upon his return to the Coliseum, Velloro exhibited new purpose, using his newfound skills to great effect in his gladiatorial matches. His tendency to crumple the armor and weapons of his opponents as he sent them flying across the arena quickly earned him the nickname the Castrovel Crusher. But as Akiton&rsquo;s gladiatorial combats continued to gain in popularity, the demand for blood sport also grew. The Coliseum&rsquo;s management began to pressure Velloro to mortally wound his opponents. Velloro adamantly refused; he saw no honor in needless blood sport.</p>\n<p>One day, just before a match against Dhareen, Velloro&rsquo;s manager told him, &ldquo;finish her&mdash;or you&rsquo;re finished.&rdquo; Velloro walked into the arena, embraced his mentor, and left the coliseum, the crowd bursting into an uproar mixed with cheers and mockery. Knowing he could never return to his beloved profession, Velloro turned an eye to the stars, where he knew there were others like his family&mdash;others who needed protection and assistance.</p>\n<p>Velloro is quick to laugh and make new friends. Despite the sour end to his gladiatorial career, his love of games and sport have not waned, and he is always happy to strike his famous Castrovel Crusher pose at a fan&rsquo;s request</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Aspect Embodiment (Ex)</strong> Once per combat, when Velloro hits multiple creatures in a single round with an attack or attacks (or effects that require an attack roll), he can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking an additional action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bodyguard </strong>As a reaction when an adjacent ally is attacked, Velloro can grant that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against that attack. If he does so, Velloro takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his own Armor Class until the beginning of his next turn.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cleave</strong> Velloro can choose to take a &ndash;2 penalty to his AC until his next turn in order to make a melee attack against a foe adjacent to him as a standard action. If he hits, he can make a second melee attack against a different foe adjacent to both him and the first foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Pool (Su)</strong> Velloro has a pool of Entropy Points (EP) that he can spend to fuel different abilities. He can have up to 3 EP in his entropic pool at a time, and he can gain EP only when involved in a combat encounter. When combat begins, Velloro gains 1 EP at the beginning of his first action; at the end of combat, he loses any Entropy Points he has remaining. He can gain EP in the following ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While he has no Entropy Points, Velloro can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>Each time he takes 8 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any effects that reduce that damage, such as mitigate), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If Velloro takes damage from a critical hit, he gains 1 EP, in addition to any he would gain from the attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</li>\n<li>If Velloro scores a critical hit on a significant enemy, he gains 1 EP.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If he takes a full action to charge, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If he takes two move actions on the same turn to move his speed each time, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of Velloro&rsquo;s next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to him or he designates a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If Velloro&rsquo;s entropic focus takes 8 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Velloro can expend Entropy Points in the ways listed below or for his flatten bullets ability. As long as he has at least 1 EP in his entropic pool, he gains a +1 enhancement bonus to his Armor Class.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move his speed, Velloro can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type he has).</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can expend 1 EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack he makes before the start of his next turn. He must decide how many EP to expend when he takes this move action, and he can&rsquo;t expend more than 3 EP. If the boosted entropic strike hits, he deals +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Strike (Su) </strong>This is a one-handed magical advanced melee attack with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC. Velloro does not need a free hand to make this attack. The damage dealt by this attack is acid, bludgeoning, or both. He can deliver the attack with his body or through his shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropy Shield (Su)</strong> As part of any move action or full action he takes, Velloro can create a field of compressed entropy that forms in place on one of his limbs to protect him as a basic riot shield or basic tactical shield (he chooses which each time he creates the shield). The shield has no bulk, but it otherwise functions as a physical shield of the selected type.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Velloro can dismiss the shield as part of any move or full action he takes, and it disappears at the end of his turn if he&rsquo;s not holding it.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Basic Riot Shield </em>Velloro gains a +1 shield bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to any bull rush combat maneuvers he attempts. He also takes a &ndash;2 penalty to skill checks affected by armor check penalties.</li>\n<li><em>Basic Tactical Shield</em><strong> </strong>As a move action, Velloro can align the shield to give himself greater protection against one opponent, granting him a +1 shield bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent until the beginning of his next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flatten Bullets (Su)</strong> When he would be hit by a ranged attack with a weapon that deals kinetic damage, Velloro can spend 1 Entropy Point as a reaction to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 the CR or level of the attacker) to take half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Magic</strong> Velloro has the following spell-like abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Daze</em>: This spell causes a humanoid creature of CR 3 or lower within 35 feet to be dazed for 1 round (Will DC 11 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Detect Thoughts</em>: Velloro can detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures within a 60-foot cone, and if he concentrates, he can attempt to read those thoughts (Will DC 12 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Psychokinetic Hand</em>: Once cast, as long as he concentrates (a standard action each round) Velloro can use a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. He can&rsquo;t perform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but can push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Velloro can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mitigate (Su) </strong>As a reaction when he takes damage, Velloro can spend 1 EP to reduce the damage he takes by 4. If he does, he can&rsquo;t gain any EP from that attack. Additionally, as a swift action, Velloro can remove any DR or energy resistance he has, or end the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases his AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for him. If he ends an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, he suspends the listed benefits until the beginning of his next turn. Additionally, whenever Velloro is first affected by an ability or spell that grants him DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, he can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Reactive (Ex) </strong>Once per day, Velloro can take up to two reactions in a single round. He can still only take one reaction per triggering event.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rugged </strong>This alternative racial trait grants the Toughness feat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness </strong>Velloro gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Velloro adds his character level to damage dealt with melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with operative melee weapons and small arms (though he adds his full level to his entropic strike damage rolls). This is already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Lashunta Ringwear II</strong> While wearing this armor, Velloro can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 5 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 10 times before it needs to be reloaded or recharged (each shot uses 2 battery charges).

Additionally, whenever you are directly controlling your drone, it can use any of your skill ranks if you wish, assuming it has the appropriate tools to do so (a drone without manipulator arms cannot use Engineering to disable a device, for example).&nbsp;</span></p>\n        <p><em>On Details page, select one of the skills listed above as the Bonus Skill</em></p>"},"isArmorSlot":false,"isFree":false,"maxInstalls":1,"modifiers":[],"shieldProficiency":"","source":"","weaponProficiency":"sarms"}}],"system":{"abilities":{"cha":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"con":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"dex":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"int":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"str":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"wis":{"base":10,"min":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"value":10}},"attributes":{"armorSlots":{"current":0,"max":0},"arms":2,"bab":0,"baseAttackBonus":{"rolledMods":[],"tooltip":[],"value":0},"cmd":{"min":0,"tooltip":[],"value":10},"eac":{"min":0,"tooltip":[],"value":10},"fort":{"bonus":0,"misc":0,"tooltip":[],"value":0},"hp":{"max":10,"min":0,"temp":null,"tempmax":null,"tooltip":[],"value":10},"init":{"bonus":0,"tooltip":[],"total":0,"value":0},"kac":{"min":0,"tooltip":[],"value":10},"keyability":"","reach":"","reflex":{"bonus":0,"misc":0,"tooltip":[],"value":0},"rp":{"max":10,"min":0,"tooltip":[],"value":0},"sp":{"max":10,"min":0,"tooltip":[],"value":0},"space":"","speed":{"burrowing":{"base":0},"climbing":{"base":0},"flying":{"base":0},"land":{"base":30},"mainMovement":"land","special":"","swimming":{"base":0}},"weaponMounts":{"melee":{"current":0,"max":0},"ranged":{"current":0,"max":0}},"will":{"bonus":0,"misc":0,"tooltip":[],"value":0}},"conditions":{"asleep":false,"bleeding":false,"blinded":false,"broken":false,"burning":false,"confused":false,"cowering":false,"dazed":false,"dazzled":false,"dead":false,"deafened":false,"dying":false,"encumbered":false,"entangled":false,"exhausted":false,"fascinated":false,"fatigued":false,"flat-footed":false,"frightened":false,"grappled":false,"helpless":false,"nauseated":false,"off-kilter":false,"off-target":false,"overburdened":false,"panicked":false,"paralyzed":false,"pinned":false,"prone":false,"shaken":false,"sickened":false,"stable":false,"staggered":false,"stunned":false,"unconscious":false},"counterClasses":{"values":{}},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"details":{"alignment":"","biography":{"age":0,"dateOfBirth":"","fullBodyImage":"","gmNotes":null,"height":"","otherVisuals":"","public":"","value":"<h2>DRONE MODS</h2>\n<p><strong>Camera&nbsp;</strong>As long as Scout is within range of Quig&rsquo;s custom rig (2,500 feet), Quig can see through Scout&rsquo;s senses (seeing whatever a typical human could see).&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flight System&nbsp;</strong>Scout has a flight system included in its chassis.
