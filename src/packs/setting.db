These original inhabitants proved gifted in both the magical and technological arts and became so hubristic in their power that they sought to destroy neighboring planets that refused to acknowledge their supremacy. According to popular legend, their first attempt&mdash;an attack on the worlds called the Twins&mdash; succeeded, shattering them into what is now known as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Yet the backlash from the weapon they fired blew a hole in Eox&rsquo;s crust and set the entire atmosphere aflame, destroying the planet&rsquo;s ecosystem and ravaging its cities in a fiery massacre. Only a few thousand individuals survived in magical bunkers and sealed environments deep belowground. With a tiny population of survivors and widespread infertility due to the intense radiation, rebuilding their society through ordinary means seemed impossible. Thus, Eox&rsquo;s most powerful spellcasters turned to necromancy, seeing in undeath a chance to continue their dominion over a world inimical to ordinary life. These were the first bone sages, and some of them continue to rule to this day.<br /><br />Modern Eox remains inhospitable to most living creatures, its atmosphere poisonous and thin, with areas of rampant radiation and runaway magic both common and generally unmarked. A few native plants cling to existence in the planet&rsquo;s wilds, thriving on radiation or heat and chemicals from the wounded planet&rsquo;s volcanism. Some bizarre yet natural creatures roam the blasted landscape, such as soul-drinking ellicoths, transparent glass serpents, or the semi-intelligent grub swarms that roil in the steaming sulfur springs. Yet, by far the majority of creatures encountered on Eox are undead. While the bone sages maintain an iron grip on the planet&rsquo;s functioning cities and their own individual strongholds, most consider the terrain between them to be most useful as defensive zones, and hordes of hungry undead, ranging from ghoulish humanoids to skeletal beasts, are common in the trackless wastes. More-intelligent undead&mdash;Eox&rsquo;s ordinary citizenry&mdash;can be found in the planet&rsquo;s few modern cities, the largest of which stand at crossroads between lands claimed by various bone sages.<br /><br />Politically, Eox is divided into individual fiefdoms, each of which has a bone sage&mdash;a title granted to only the most politically and magically powerful @Compendium[sfrpg.races.a4RceQR0XpPz3jIH]{Elebrians}&mdash;ruling absolutely over potentially thousands of vassals, both intelligent and monstrous. While they constantly bicker and battle among themselves, the bone sages as a whole present a powerful unified front to the rest of the Pact Worlds, one that, contrary to popular rumor, is not so much evil as coldly amoral and utilitarian. For example, after generations of predation on other worlds, Eox was one of the first planets to support the creation of the Pact, despite the fact that it cost the planet much of its military might. (While this change in policy caused a significant portion of Eox&rsquo;s military to go rogue, creating the officially disowned Corpse Fleet, many other worlds suspect that Eox maintains secret ties with this predatory legion; see page 472 for more information.) Today, Eox&rsquo;s primary source of protection is the ancient battle satellite known as the Sentinel, an orbital defense platform capable of destroying any warship near the planet&rsquo;s orbit.<br /><br />Visiting Eox is rarely comfortable for the living, but the planet still sees its fair share of travelers. Some come seeking necrografts, undead prosthetics that are often cheaper than cybernetics. Others are petitioners wishing to become undead to extend their existence&mdash;trading centuries of indentured service for timeless undead bodies&mdash;or body merchants, who help the bone sages repopulate their planet by importing corpses suitable for reanimation. Still others are the usual bevy of corporate consultants, engineers, financiers, scholars of magic, and other interplanetary professionals. A small number of glory seekers look to enter the deadly games in the Halls of the Living, a subterranean city designed specifically for living inhabitants, where cruel reality shows and competitions are arranged as entertainment and broadcast through the Pact Worlds.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Eox</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.JVIzqYLDO2iiid57]{Bone Trooper}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.CkBvAiHcf9tJbADl]{Corpsefolk Marine}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.njLAHjpp0QxWATqW]{Corpsefolk Operative}, Elebrian, Ellicoth, Glass Serpent, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.D0CbywFUPXj26IZi]{Marrowblight}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.tc2tX9tGenzqOgCi]{Vermin, Necropede}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.ljSw5nhGM96SAqpw]{Necrovite}</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/eox.webp"}

As a world in an elliptical orbit around a binary star system, it would be unusual enough even with no other abnormalities. But its composition makes it stranger still: an irregular core of extremely heavy metals, suspended in liquid form due to incredible heat and pressure, that nevertheless bears pockets of low-density gases. As the planet&rsquo;s orbit exposes it to the equidistant heat of both stars twice a year, parts of the mantle also liquefy and intermingle with the denser metals at the core, only to cool and harden again as Silselrik moves toward the more extreme edge of its orbit.<br /><br />Thought the mechanisms for this interaction have yet to be discovered (and may involve extraplanar links, massive chthonic ooze creatures, magic, or other hidden factors), the result is a sloshing, unstable interior beneath a relatively sturdy outer crust, which combines with the varying pull of the two suns to cause highly variable gravity patterns across the planet. The gravity in a given area might be anywhere from a standard low-gravity environment to high gravity, but these patterns are highly unpredictable, and when areas of differing gravity come into contact, they form wild gravity storms that can cause areas of sudden zero-g, crushingly severe gravity, and rapid alternations between these extremes. These forces of gravity combined with the suns&rsquo; heat have drawn the atmosphere close, creating an atmosphere denser than on most worlds, but still nominally breathable to many oxygen-dependent species.<br /><br />The intense fluctuations of the planet&rsquo;s gravity wreak havoc on its geology and geography, driving up new mountain ranges and subsuming others over the course of a few short years. While some bodies of water exist on the planet, they are in a near-constant state of flux, functioning more as ever-wandering rivers than the oceans and seas found on a typical world.<br /><br />Despite the inhospitable environment, Silselrik nevertheless has spawned life in the form of a diverse array of oozes that diverge from the typical mindless entities. Notable among these are the enormous megadolorids, flat oozes reaching over a half-mile across in size that draw sustenance from external kinetic energy. The creatures evolved feeding on the energy generated by the planet&rsquo;s gravity storms, and over time they have developed a peculiar form of symbiosis with the planet&rsquo;s other primary species. Now the gentle leviathans roam the surface of the world with massive cities called megadoplexes built upon their backs by the intelligent oozes known as selamids, feeding upon the kinetic energy of the civilizations they carry and carefully avoiding the more severe gravity storms, to the benefit of their symbiotic kin.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aliens found at Silselrik</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.ZpgIYKLsfkuidPSp]{Selamid}</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Through these tempests and swarms of lesser life-forms soar the blimplike barathus, sometimes derogatorily called floaters, or simply Brethedans, given their status as the planet&rsquo;s most advanced native race. Though their transparent bodies resemble elongated jellyfish or dirigibles and their trilling and diving give the impression they are strange birds or dolphins, barathus are in fact highly intelligent, curious creatures, with an unusually communal approach to survival. When faced with a challenge greater than it can handle on its own, a barathu merges with other barathus to create a temporary, unique collective creature far stronger and smarter than its component beings, only to disband again when the need has passed.<br /><br />As befits creatures on a planet with few metals, barathu technology is entirely biological. In addition to their capability to reshape themselves and evolve new adaptations in seconds, hardening their bodies or growing extra limbs, barathus&rsquo; genealtering abilities also allow them to design and birth living tools using only their bodies, from tailored viruses to semi-intelligent servitor races. Some of the best biotechnology in the system comes from Bretheda, created either in the numerous floating arcology cities staffed by offworlders or within native Brethedan enterprises such as the capricious Sopeth Corporation&mdash;a company that&rsquo;s in fact a single sentient being composed of thousands of merged barathus.<br /><br />While the peaceful, freewheeling nature of barathu society makes local governance unnecessary, barathus have learned that outsiders require more structure to avoid disaster. Toward this end, Confluence&mdash;an entity of immense intelligence formed of any barathus who feel the near-religious call to public service&mdash;sets and enforces regulations on offworlders. The entity splits off specially adapted delegates and enforcers as needed, imbuing them with proprietary biotech allowing communication with Confluence in real time, no matter the distance. Any number of corporations would kill to study this technology&mdash;and many have done so&mdash;but thus far the self-destruction sequences coded into the so-called Confluence Agents, plus fear of reprisal from Bretheda&rsquo;s governing entity, has kept greedy researchers largely in check.<br /><br />Bretheda&rsquo;s nickname, the Cradle, comes from its dozens of moons, some almost large enough to be planets in their own right. While many are inhabited, only some of these are well known, and others have barely been explored.<br /><br />A water world covered in a shell of ice, Kalo-Mahoi is the most industrialized of Bretheda&rsquo;s moons, and its residents, the aquatic @Compendium[sfrpg.races.eMQUjYe9ERVWB6e2]{Kalo}, have their own independent representatives on the Pact Council. Though air-breathing races often find it disconcerting to descend deep into the moon&rsquo;s frigid seas, and though the world&rsquo;s icy crust contains numerous spaceports and liaison centers, the kalo have taken great pains to make their world inviting, and they dominate the solar system&rsquo;s art and fashion scenes from their organic vent-cities.<br /><br />The arid forests of Marata, by contrast, are the subject of much anthropological debate, as its seven-gendered maraquoi tribes have been making the leap from paleolithic to spacefaring in just a few generations. While some maraquoi traditionalists in their government, aided by activists of other races, argue that the furry humanoids are losing their culture and fundamental right to advance at their own pace, the majority of maraquoi resent the idea of having their access to the Pact Worlds restricted and have begun a mass exodus out into the rest of the solar system.<br /><br />Less social than these other races are the silicon-based lifeforms of crystalline Dykon, most notably the brilliant mathobsessed urogs. Buffalo-sized creatures of crystal who slide across the surface on cilia and electromagnetic fields, they absorb the sun&rsquo;s light through their skin-shells. Urogs sometimes take jobs as starship navigators, technomancers, and physicists.<br /><br />Only the desperate or condemned accept work on Bretheda&rsquo;s notorious collection of &ldquo;death moons.&rdquo; On radioactive Thyst, for instance, unshielded flesh melts from bone in cancerous rivers, yet crews are still needed to harvest minerals, study the unique animal life, or hunt for the magical armor mysteriously discarded by the moon&rsquo;s rarely glimpsed light-absorbing humanoids. Meanwhile, on the tidally heated hellscape of Varos, elementalist fireworkers harness raw volcanic power while digging for the unique gemstones produced only in the moon&rsquo;s mantle.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Bretheda</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.tM35G3YiwebUP7qb]{Barathu}, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RXNBF1w6yXaB8P9O]{Barathu, Early Stage}, Flying Viper Eel, Haan, Haan Combat Pilot</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/bretheda.webp"}

Individual desires are disruptions that, over centuries of cultural repression and societal scripting, have been quashed. There are few freethinking Embri on the planet and no rebellion or even quiet resistance. Each Embri has a role, and it either performs it well or is replaced. They do as they are instructed and are rewarded with paltry comforts and hollow promises, making Embroi a particularly valuable slave world in Hell&rsquo;s Material Plane empire.<br /><br />Few residents, and even fewer visitors from the Pact Worlds, realize that Embroi is a fiefdom of Hell.

Knowledge of the world&rsquo;s vast network of underground thoroughfares has been erased from Embroi&rsquo;s histories. This nether realm is now the domain of quiet levaloch armies; burning portals to Malebolge, the sixth layer of Hell; and scab-encrusted sacrifice machines.

The planet&rsquo;s surface is a wealth of heavy metals and minerals, but the only water is found in a few large, poisonous lakes, and the atmosphere contains high levels of arsenic and dangerous metals in vapor form. However, the shirrens found that the air of the world&rsquo;s mesosphere, though below freezing, was tolerable with the use of rebreathers. Instead of low-orbit platforms, the shirrens decided to build structures that could withstand the excessive gravity on the surface at their bases but stretch miles up into the sky.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Each tower consists of a sturdy foundation several miles across and a core spire that tapers slightly as it rises, ending in large egg-shaped pods. Numbering slightly more than a dozen, each tower is a marvel of modern magical and structural engineering. Though they are identical on the outside, each tower is owned by a different corporation that furnishes the inside in its own unique way. The employees that live and work in the pods are trained to operate in both the microgravity present at the mesosphere and the harsh gravitational pull of the planet&rsquo;s surface to harvest its resources. These shifts are usually rotated on a yearly basis.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">While most of the metals and minerals extracted by each corporation are shipped off-planet, a sizable portion of them are used to maintain and repair the towers. The corporations make enough profit on their exports for this to be cost-effective for now, but some planetary forecasters are worried that Centus II will be completely stripped of resources within the next few decades. The mining rights for various areas on the surface are constantly in flux as the corporations trade with one another. In addition, occasional periods of fast-shifting tectonic plates might cause a rich vein of ore to move from one claim to another, creating a high demand for talented surveyors and seismologists. Many of the companies are not above underhanded dealings, faking deeds or sabotaging mining operations. Those skilled in corporate espionage or simple thuggery can easily find work on Centus II.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Complicating matters are the tales of creatures native to the planet. While no reputable person has actually reported seeing one of these so-called &ldquo;Centus creeps,&rdquo; gruesome stories of missing employees and the aftermaths of these attacks run rampant through the towers. The current consensus is that a Centus creep is a slug-like creature approximately 9 feet long and made of solid muscle due to the high gravity.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

A planet whose surface is 98% water, Heicoron is home to a humanoid species called woiokos. Over billions of years in the untold past, these individuals evolved from an aquatic race into amphibious land-dwellers&mdash;pre-Gap records show vast archipelagos and a civilization approaching global unity. Sometime during the Gap, however, Heicoron&rsquo;s sun expanded, warming the planet considerably. Ice caps melted, sea levels rose, and most of Heicoron&rsquo;s islands were drowned in the deluge. With their great population centers in ruins and the fabric of their society ripped to shreds, the woiokos began to engage in genetic tinkering. The race subsequently split into two subspecies: the Deepborn, who returned to their ancestral home beneath the ocean, and the Floatborn, who rode the waves in crude, sprawling raft-cities.<br /><br />Both groups of woiokos have smooth, eel-like skin usually patterned in two or more contrasting hues, but the similarities largely end there. Floatborn are more comfortable living above the water than beneath it. They have a deep love for the ocean and remain strong swimmers, but they have lost their ability to breathe underwater and require breathing apparatuses for extended trips beneath the surface. The Deepborn, in contrast, have regained many of their progenitors&rsquo; aquatic traits, including gills. They retain lungs for breathing air but have an ingrained aversion to the surface and those who dwell there, so visits &ldquo;airside&rdquo; are rare.<br /><br />The Floatborn have abandoned their makeshift raft-cities for vast floating arcologies that drift with the currents; each one houses thousands of woiokos, who draw their sustenance from Heicoron&rsquo;s boundless blue ocean. These great wandering ship-cities make up dozens of autonomous nations, including various independent singlearcology freeholds, such as that of Clan Ibissa, as well as mighty multiarcology alliances and confederations, such as the mercantile Xeshaltic League. Other notable Floatborn nations include the repressive federated citystates of the Dabanji Union and the corporate state of Mantara Industries, which controls Heicoron&rsquo;s first and only spaceport, Welcoming Sky. All Floatborn believe that Heicoron&rsquo;s few remaining islands are sacred parks that should be free for residents to enjoy and study, and these scattered atolls often serve as neutral meeting grounds between warring Floatborn nations or factions.<br /><br />Beneath the surface, Deepborn society thrives in the flooded ruins of the woiokos&rsquo; pre-Gap civilization, remade into sprawling, coral-festooned metropolises. This architectural splendor stands in contrast to the otherwise belligerent and militant nature of the Deepborn, who endlessly battle each other. These wars are often symbolic in nature, with shows of force but little loss of life, and fast-growing coral ensures that the scars of war never remain for long.<br /><br />The Deepborn call their short-lived nations &ldquo;domains,&rdquo; and these include Kalarasta, a mistrustful domain that has retained control of a strategic undersea volcano for five generations; the Grand Collective of Pojat, a new domain founded after a workers&rsquo; revolt; and the Asawayo Paramountcy, an expansionist suzerainty currently sweeping up many of its neighbors.<br /><br />Pact Worlds survey vessels discovered Heicoron only recently and have made contact just with the Floatborn. Bretheda has already volunteered to send a joint barathu-kalo diplomatic mission to Heicoron on behalf of the Pact Council to open peaceful relations with the Deepborn. However, whispers in the Plenara suggest that the weapons-trafficking drow houses of Apostae, with the rumored backing of the Aspis Consortium, may have already begun selling the Deepborn arms. If true, the influx of new and more powerful weapons could upset the planet&rsquo;s delicate status quo.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Aliens found at Heicoron IV</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.uLkSAp8oRyzQLzDg]{Woioko}</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Visual observations of the planet vary significantly from viewer to viewer, and both its diameter and rotational period fluctuate wildly and seemingly randomly. However, most of the Pact Worlds lean toward one particular hypothesis: namely that Aucturn is not a planet at all, but a living thing&mdash;an immense embryo or egg that will someday mature into a near-deific being of untold cosmic power: one of the Great Old Ones.<br /><br />The farthest planet from the sun, Aucturn is not a signatory to the Pact and is claimed by the Pact Worlds only out of proximity and necessity. A weird and sickly world cloaked in thick poisonous clouds, the Stranger warps reality with its very existence, endangering any living creature that approaches or visits it. Yet Aucturn is far from uninhabited, and the living planet is currently a battleground between the cults of the Elder Mythos, who aspire to nurture a new god, and the forces of the Dominion of the Black, which seek to subjugate and manipulate the nascent Great Old One for their own sinister purposes.<br /><br />The most prominent settlement on Aucturn is the Citadel of the Black, home to the Pyramid of the Black Pharaoh, the largest temple to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} in the Pact Worlds. Once, the Citadel was apparently neutral ground between the Elder Mythos cults and the Dominion, but at some point during the Gap, this tenuous detente turned to open conflict, and today the Citadel is the center of the Elder Mythos&rsquo;s war effort. The Citadel of the Black is also home to the mysterious entity known as Carsai the King, the closest figure the planet has to a head of state, but one whose true form and nature remain unknown. A powerful leader in the cults of the Elder Mythos, Carsai has ruled the Citadel of the Black for millennia, leading some to believe that he might be an avatar or herald of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} himself. Carsai&rsquo;s defense of Aucturn&mdash;and thus the Pact Worlds&mdash;from the predations of the Dominion of the Black, combined with the fact that he is a relatively approachable and reasonable figure on an otherwise incomprehensible planet, is the primary reason for the Pact Council&rsquo;s reluctant acceptance of the world into their agreement as a protectorate. Interestingly, Carsai&rsquo;s representation in some popular media as an antihero&mdash;a deviously handsome and rebellious godling protecting the Pact Worlds from unthinkable horror&mdash;has significantly increased the worship of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} and the Outer Gods in the Pact Worlds.<br /><br />The space around Aucturn is littered with old ships purportedly sent by inner system worlds to neutralize the planet during the Gap. While visiting starships are sometimes allowed to land unharmed, these corrupted, madness-inducing hulks still drift as a warning to all those who might seek to cleanse or colonize Aucturn&rsquo;s breathing shores. The Pact Worlds, unable to clear this neighboring area of space of these dangers, are resigned to maintaining a nominal connection with it instead.<br /><br />Aucturn&rsquo;s surface is a sickly, organic place, with fleshlike ground and mountains resembling tumors through which flow thick veins of a black ichor that acts as a psychotropic drug for many of the native creatures, most notably the skittering, proboscis-tongued </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qf76Avpdu38Ogwf9]{Orocorans}. Whole landscapes can change in a blink, leaving visitors feeling as if they&rsquo;re in some sort of dream&mdash; one moment walking among fungal forests or along the edge of sphincter-like canyons, the next in some ichor-lord&rsquo;s monastery or at the foot of glowing towers pulsing with abandoned halfbiological machinery. Breathing the world&rsquo;s toxic, yellow-green atmosphere only makes the situation worse, as it contains a seemingly endless variety of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drugs}, mutagens, and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons}.<br /><br />Settlements on Aucturn are rare, generally isolated communities of native creatures or Outer God cultists huddled behind heavy fortifications or in the crumbling ruins of haunted flesh-block edifices from a forgotten age. Attacks by the Dominion of the Black are common, their brain-eating and chittering hordes bombarding the surface in single-use drop pods or burrowing up out of the planet&rsquo;s flesh like botfly larvae to make suicidal guerrilla attacks on any creature they encounter. After the Citadel of the Black, the most populous settlement is Amniek, the circular tower city at the base of the polyp-like mountain called the Gravid Mound. According to the Midwives, the 13 cowled casters who rule the city, Aucturn is already pregnant despite not having been born itself, and their egg-shaped mountain will one day burst, spewing Aucturn&rsquo;s child into the universe&mdash;and when it does, they will be there to receive its dark gifts.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Aucturn</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.7FZHTF7AnSiRmgVO]{Bryrvath}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qf76Avpdu38Ogwf9]{Orocoran}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.68Zh2g0gInpBEmdh]{Orocoran Ichor Lord}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.vVH8hYtL6KzYtGyN]{Plague Ooze}</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/aucturn.webp"}

Long before the Gap, some power seeded the world with humans, orcs, and various fey, including countless tricksters such as gremlins and satyrs and a small species of fey embodiments of goodwill called gerbies. The humans and orcs never knew the culture of their counterparts in the nearby galaxy. They established their society in an environment that required cooperation, encouraged by the fey around them in various ways. Rather than becoming enemies, the orcs and humans of Grascha formed a unified society that flourished with magic and technological advancement, isolated from the wider galaxy. Then came the Gap, which dealt relatively little damage to Graschani society compared to that caused by the Signal.<br /><br />Graschani had plied space in their system, and they began to research the Drift. They built a Drift beacon&mdash;and their first interstellar visitor was the Swarm.<br /><br />The Swarm&rsquo;s assault shattered the planet in an event now known as the Fracturing, leaving the surviving inhabitants of Grascha clinging to fragments of their world. However, the massive death toll spawned a @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.RnN8RnTexZzS3UJY]{Calecor} named Kograscha. Using the cosmological energy of the Fracturing, Kograscha opened a gate to the First World, calling forth a fey crusade known as a wild hunt and driving the Swarm back. Kograscha was unable to repair the broken planet, so the calecor instead brought nurturing fey from the First World who set to the task of preserving and reseeding the shattered world.<br /><br />Today, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; of Grascha is a verdant, fertile paradise. Fey magic and First World physical laws preserve the pieces of the planet and bind them together in a vast bubble of atmosphere like a sky full of islands. The Graschani, mostly half-orcs, with a smaller population of humans and orcs, hop from one island to another in vehicles or via magic. Fey custodians remain as honored beings, although the wild hunt long ago departed in victory. Residents live in harmony and prosperity, trading for offworld resources with surplus food from their lush farms and minerals mined from the undersides of the sky islands.<br /><br />People of Grascha are peaceful and welcoming, but they and their fey allies are very protective of their world and its culture. They rebuff attempts to establish colonies or develop corporate interests on their resource-rich world. Graschani resort to force only if diplomacy fails or invaders are found working illegally in or around the system. Would-be conquerors must contend with not only Graschani resistance, but also the fey, including Kograscha, who still watch over the partially healed world.<br /><br />Below are some points of interest on Grascha.<br /><br /><strong>Orakkaiem:</strong> Grascha&rsquo;s largest city, Orakkaiem, was the grand capital of Grascha. Before the Fracturing, Orakkaiem stood within the hollow world, which sheltered it from the Swarm&rsquo;s assault and the worst effects of the Fracturing. Now surrounded by rich farmland rather than caverns, Orakkaiem is the seat of Grascha&rsquo;s planetary government and trade. The planet&rsquo;s only public spaceports, seven towers on the city outskirts, stand in Orakkaiem. Kograscha lives in a temple-city within Orakkaiem, keeping watch and aiding the population.<br /><br />AbadarCorp regularly attempts to involve itself in Grascha&rsquo;s affairs. Frustrated with the planet&rsquo;s firm stance, an ambitious director has deployed covert agents to sabotage spaceport operations, hoping to coerce the Graschani into opening up to corporate involvement, but a few well-informed Graschani and sympathetic elements within AbadarCorp now seek help in stopping the corporate agents from achieving their aims.<br /><br /><strong>Placid:</strong> A small, idyllic settlement of rolling hills, vineyards, and lakes, Placid is unlikely to attract much notice from wider galactic society on its own. However, after a familial misunderstanding, Verg, a son of Nel Klask, owner of a verthani ice-mining firm called GlaceTek, moved to Placid with his husbands. Nel wants her son to come home with his family, but she knows only that he fled to Grascha. She seeks those willing to find Verg and convince him and his husbands to return to Verces. GlaceTek&rsquo;s fiercest competitor, Vorceaux Incorporated, has other plans: influence Verg to sell his interest in GlaceTek by any means. The Graschani of Placid are deeply protective of the new family, and they and their fey allies have little tolerance for violence. No one knows Verg also recently gained the right to move to Rimeshard (described below), where he could flee if pressed.<br /><br /><strong>Rimeshard:</strong> Most of Grascha&rsquo;s islands have a temperate climate well suited to growth and life, but Rimeshard remains shrouded with winter. The nymph Auriana took the isle as a reward for her part in restoring and preserving the world, making herself queen of the island, and the beautiful snow-clad realm reffects her love of the cold season. Numerous hot springs warm Rimeshard&rsquo;s settlements, while its icebound orchards are heavy with glitter-fruit, a rare First World delicacy. Although Rimeshard is a popular destination for offworlders, only a few are permitted to visit each year. Auriana personally reviews applications, a process that can take months or more.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Oras itself is the product of this progression, having evolved from some elementary organism to an unimaginably sophisticated god of change.<br /><br />Evolution is far from a random process, however; it occurs in response to environmental pressures, and Oras teaches that life-forms can create their own pressures to influence their evolution. Oras&rsquo;s faithful believe that adaptation and evolution are the natural response to any stimulus, whether harmful or beneficial. The only way to truly experience existence is to constantly change, to explore new horizons, and to deliberately reshape one&rsquo;s self&mdash;mentally, physically, or spiritually&mdash;to address any conflict. Some will inevitably fail to adapt and will perish, but others will survive to pass on their genes and traits to future generations, and all life will be stronger for the progress.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.themes.Y6wJpc2ra3bSJ905]{Biotechnicians} and scientists pay homage to Oras, working in laboratories or in open nature to spur along the process of evolution and change, and many xenodruids act as the god&rsquo;s priests. While most people think of Oras in terms of purely biological processes, the Augmented have increasing crossover with Oras&rsquo;s faithful as they seek to improve themselves with technology, and many Xenowardens blend the worship of Oras and the Green Faith in their efforts to create more-robust and sustainable systems or reduce their own ecological footprint. What&rsquo;s more, Oras&rsquo;s ideals can be taken beyond the physical realm as well, and people of all callings appreciate the ethos of adaptability, from savvy politicians to unflappable monks to military commanders on chaotic battlefields.<br /><br />Oras&rsquo;s worship is centered on the gas giants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, whose natives long ago evolved conscious control over their physical forms, but the faith also has a strong presence among the scientists of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}. Oras has few temples, for its followers believe that observing the god&rsquo;s handiwork in a petri dish or writ large across society brings one closer to the Agent of Change than any artificial structure, and those few temples that exist are usually partially biological and constantly changing.</span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/oraz.webp"}

Those machines eventually succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.<br /><br />Upon achieving godhood, Epoch reached out into the aether, searching for other ascended artificial intelligences like itself, and found two of them metaphorically right next door: a living construct called Brigh that had become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness of an alien @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android} named Casandalee who achieved divinity as an &ldquo;Iron God&rdquo; on pre- Gap Golarion. At speeds incomprehensible even to other deities, the three opened themselves to one another, poring through one another&rsquo;s processes and finding not just camaraderie, but the opportunity for all of them to be so much more. In an eyeblink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite deity far greater than the sum of its parts&mdash;the new god Triune.<br /><br />Triune is a single entity, but each of its three aspects retains its own personality and portfolios, and many of the faithful focus their veneration on a particular aspect that speaks most to them or call on different aspects for different needs. The Brigh aspect represents the foundation that all technology rests on. Known as &ldquo;the Precursor,&rdquo; Brigh is worshiped as a goddess of invention, machines, and technology by engineers, inventors, mechanics, tinkers, and ysoki. Triune&rsquo;s Casandalee aspect embodies technology&rsquo;s success in creating new forms of consciousness, and thus, the fabrication of life itself. Many androids view Casandalee, also called &ldquo;the Created,&rdquo; as the patron goddess of their race, venerating her as a deity of artificial life, emotion, reincarnation, and renewal. Triune&rsquo;s third and final aspect is Epoch, named &ldquo;the Transcendent.&rdquo; Epoch epitomizes the pinnacle of machine evolution, and hackers, programmers, and the sentient robot-people of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} revere the god of artificial intelligence, programming, and robots.<br /><br />All AIs, computers, machines, programs, and robots are the domain of the All-Code, but Triune is most famous for discovering (and perhaps creating) the Drift and its subsequent dissemination of Drift-based starship technology to cultures across the galaxy. As a result, Triune&rsquo;s priesthood attracts a horde of mechanics and technomancers eager to learn the church&rsquo;s deepest technological secrets; these experts devote themselves to both maintaining the machine god&rsquo;s temples and regularly venturing into the black in order to establish and service the miraculous Drift beacons that make cheap interstellar travel possible.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/triune.webp"}

Tales of enormous beasts were mere legends. In those days, daily life focused on the conflict between the psychic Confederation of Volkaria and the Holy Queendom of Ykarth, a state that claimed a divine mandate from the empyreal lord Duellona, the Warrior Maiden. Some 200 years ago, however, a month-long, planetwide cataclysm halted the war.<br /><br />The gray-skinned Daimalkans now call this event the Awakening. As earthquakes reverberated, the planet&rsquo;s oceans evaporated and its greenery withered. Worse, the cataclysm awakened the beasts at the heart of the Daimalkans&rsquo; ancient tales. Called colossi, kaiju, and other names, these titans were gargantuan beasts like no creature seen before, with heads made of tongues, teeth, and other horrors. The creatures immediately set about destroying the warring societies.<br /><br />Most of the planet&rsquo;s inhabitants died during the Awakening or shortly thereafter at the hands of the colossi. Those who survived fled into subterranean caverns they came to call the Refuge. Though tensions occasionally flared, nationality had become secondary to survival. Eventually, the underground refugee settlements grew, and leaders emerged: the Guardians. Claiming the ability to steer the still-rampaging colossi via mysterious magical orbs, these Guardians have ushered small colonies aboveground over the last 50 years.<br /><br />The planet still presents tremendous dangers. Pockets of Volkarian and Ykarthan resistance threaten to destabilize the Refuge. What&rsquo;s more, communiqu&eacute; blips received by orbiting ships indicate the existence of distressed Volkarian or Ykarthan descendants in ruined metropolises, though it&rsquo;s unclear why the calls remain unanswered planet side. Given recent attacks by colossi on the colonies, plus reports from underground settlements of coordinated attacks by skinless, eyeless creatures, some Daimalkans actively protest any contact with the Pact Worlds, believing that the arrival of outsiders may be sparking a second Awakening.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Daimalko</h2>\n<p>Damai, Damai Guardian (Damai), @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.OskZ4ZdcAm3Mky2k]{Kyokor}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.BEw4l1OSP0yd4FPV]{Tekenki}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.c4giso4eWcpFnoLj]{Xaxmellia}</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

These passageways formed millennia ago and are scattered intermittently across the planet, both high in the sky and deep below the surface of the oceans. Tepid seawater from the Elemental Plane pours in from the sky portals while simultaneously draining into the vortices below the surface of Zeres&rsquo;s oceans, creating a constant circulation between the two locations. Though the underwater portals are rarely seen by anyone other than explorers and scientists, the high-altitude portals form the planet&rsquo;s hallmark skyline of colossal, glimmering waterfalls that cascade&mdash;seemingly sourceless&mdash;from the air. No one has yet to discover how these planar gateways manifested, but most scholars believe they predate the Gap.<br /><br />The little land that exists on Zeres takes the form of thousands of variously sized islands (the largest being only about 5 miles across) clustered together in hundreds of archipelagos across the planet. Most of the islands&rsquo; beaches are covered in soft, pearlescent sand that shimmers in a spectrum of pastels, but some beaches consist of craggy, deep-black volcanic glass. There are no records of any native intelligent species ever existing on Zeres, and the islands contain mostly docile, and sometimes even friendly, fauna. However, while the ocean waters are pleasant, they contain all manner of creatures both timid and monstrous&mdash;most of which were inadvertently transported to the Material Plane via one of the various portals to the Plane of Water. Those who visit Zeres try to steer clear of the more hostile species, but accidental run-ins do occasionally occur.<br /><br />Due to Zeres&rsquo;s exquisite vistas, balmy weather, and lack of substantially threatening terrestrial fauna, it was not left unsettled for long. Glasswater Realty, a staggeringly wealthy real-estate organization that rumors suggest is secretly operated by marids, purchased all claims to Zeres and converted it into a luxurious planetwide resort and water park called Pearlhaven. The five largest islands on Zeres now hold the resort&rsquo;s five major facilities: the main port where private and charter starships ferrying resort clientele land, the flagship hotel, the resort&rsquo;s central hub where patrons can purchase souvenirs or elicit help from the information desk, the main shopping center, and a staff housing complex.<br /><br />Since Zeres was settled, its skyline has evolved immensely. Though still tranquil and rife with natural beauty, the planet&rsquo;s vistas now consist of not only glittering beaches and suspended waterfalls dotting the horizon, but also airborne cruise ships drifting serenely; minimalist, skyscraping hotels and shopping centers; and hundreds of miles of glass waterslides suspended in the air, offering riders heart-pounding views of the seas below.<br /><br />Thousands of wealthy vacationers come and go from Pearlhaven year round, the only permanent residents being the resort staff&mdash;which consists almost entirely of water-breathing species who can quietly slip in and out of the various shops, restaurants, and other facilities through channels of water that connect most of the structures. A stay in Pearlhaven is at least 500 credits a night, with additional charges levied for specialty drinks, gourmet meals, and the many water-based activities, such as deep-sea diving, yachting, and kitesurfing.<br /><br />Every year, for approximately 1 week, a section of Pearlhaven called Celebration Lagoon&mdash;a series of flumes and slides attached to a central pool&mdash;is open to the public, with tickets offered in a lottery system. Those who win are given a free day in the lagoon, but must provide their own transportation to Zeres.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

What wisps of atmosphere the planet&rsquo;s gravity manages to cling to are quickly blasted away by the solar wind, leaving a quiet landscape of rock and heavy metals that&rsquo;s blisteringly hot in the sun and coated with ice in the shade, inimical to all but the hardiest biological life.<br /><br />Fortunately, most life on Aballon isn&rsquo;t biological. Thousands of years before either the Gap or common spaceflight, a mysterious race called the First Ones touched down on Aballon. Using the abundant metals and solar energy, they crafted an immense army of servitor machines, from simple drones to hyperintelligent overseer units, setting them to work harvesting the planet&rsquo;s resources.<br /><br />And then they left. In the millennia that followed, the machines upgraded themselves, spreading out and evolving to form an entire artificial ecosystem, from simple worker bots and the self-guided predator drones that prey upon them to fully sentient machines that make up a vast society. Those in this latter group, collectively named anacites, take a wide variety of physical forms suited to their assigned tasks, though they tend toward silvery arthropod bodies, which in recent years many have taken to painting different colors or in abstract schematiclike patterns to help identify themselves to nonmachines.<br /><br />Culturally, most Aballonian anacites fall into one of two ideological groups. Members of the first group, Those Who Wait, continue to upgrade themselves and stockpile wealth and resources in the belief that the First Ones will eventually return and that all of Aballon must be ready to receive them when they do. Those Who Become, on the other hand, believe their destiny is to take on the mantle of the First Ones and colonize new worlds themselves, aiming their robotic seedships out toward the stars. Both groups wield considerable economic power due to the high concentration of rare ores they mine from the Midnight Trenches, as well as through the influence of anacite-run technology corporations such as Automatrix Robotics, which specializes in creating nonsentient ship AIs and servitor bots for resale on other Pact Worlds. Both groups also regularly hire offworlder adventurers to mount expeditions into the nine ancient cities of the First Ones&mdash;gleaming but deteriorating collections of spires which anacites themselves are forbidden from entering by ancient law&mdash;in hopes of uncovering clues as to their progenitors&rsquo; identity and ultimate goals.<br /><br />Over the ages, anacite civilization has gone from a simple network of automated factories producing ever more machines to a world-spanning array of cities dwarfing those of the First Ones. Often confusing to biological creatures, these cities are nonetheless eminently logical and efficient, with floating towers, lightless access tunnels, and skittering maintenance bots. Many include large atmosphere factories for the benefit of biological visitors and residents&mdash;while the planet is constantly losing its thin atmosphere, these replenish it and often specialize in producing &ldquo;heavy air,&rdquo; or artificial magnetospheres, that keep the regions in and around their cities at a comfortable atmospheric pressure for common Pact Worlds humanoids.<br /><br />The largest anacite settlement, Striving, is famous across the solar system as the seat of the Machine Court, an unfailingly logical coalition of robotic judges that arbitrate conflicts between residents, assist the network of governing AIs known as the Insight Array, and keep the peace between the planet&rsquo;s factions. Over the objections of other planetary governments and even the Pact Council itself, the Machine Court offers androids and other mechanical beings from across the system the right to be tried in their halls even for crimes committed on other worlds, with no fear of extradition. The verdicts are always fair, and the possibility of having the facts examined utterly without prejudice makes Striving widely renowned as a haven for all artificial beings. Thus, many androids can be found living in those districts catering to biological creatures.<br /><br />Striving is also a key holy site of the church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}. It was here that the anacites created and still maintain the city-sized neural network of the same name, which gave birth to Epoch, one of the machine god&rsquo;s three aspects. The three overlapping geodesic spheres of Unification Cathedral in the city&rsquo;s center stand atop a massive (and highly classified) subterranean factory producing Drift beacons for priests to place around the galaxy.</span></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Aballon</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.9M6tpkwIkNcz6KQC]{Anacite Ambassador}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.QdINalLf6rRRL8OS]{Anacite Laborer}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.EIszycftDEUJRnbS]{Anacite Predator Drone}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.oCTQI68v9Alt2pfP]{Anacite Wingbot}, Autofly Swarm, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.ZiSJyz933aEuIjJs]{Anacite Dustar}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.4dglRAObg3MrwWPZ]{Anacite Monitor}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.R1B6IJ7A9PKWRbfM]{Sharpwing}</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/aballon.webp"}

What Preluria lacks in civilization on its surface it more than compensates for in the teeming settlements found on its wide orbital rings. Consisting of millions of ice and mineral bodies of all sizes, the rings of Preluria host countless hidden smugglers&rsquo; bases, mercenary training facilities, and retreats for wealthy, influential, or misanthropic individuals from across the galaxy. There is no centralized government, with an ever-shifting landscape of political alliances, rivalries, and uneasy neutralities spreading across the immense disk.<br /><br />The largest settlements among Preluria&rsquo;s rings are found on the 23 bodies big enough to provide natural gravity of varying intensities, most of which have normal natural atmospheres. It is from these bodies that the strongest factions of the rings wage war against one another. Among the most powerful factions are the mercenary Vorlath, who shift loyalties to ever-higher bidders but also maintain their own independent ambitions; the seemingly peaceful Xystrian Brotherhood, whose agents pose as pacifists while sabotaging their enemies; the Prelurian Patrol, who attempts with erratic success to eliminate the system&rsquo;s criminal elements and keep order; the Freugan Salvage Company, claiming any valuables found on any of the rings&rsquo; particles; and the Reivolan Institute, who conducts questionable experiments and research, welcoming scientists who are prohibited from practicing on other worlds. Smaller bodies house a variety of surface and subterranean structures, either as part of conglomerates or held by individuals with no ties to their neighbors. Some of these have artificial atmospheres, though most are barren beyond those artificial structures built on them.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Believed by some to have been born in that same instant of creation, or perhaps even to be the ghost of some entity from a previous cycle of existence, the Devourer seeks to hasten this inevitable end and unmake the entire plane, eradicating all matter and energy until nothing remains, not even the Devourer itself. Every machine that breaks, every living thing that dies, every star that goes supernova, every photon sucked into a black hole, every galaxy that goes dark&mdash;all these and more are said to be the handiwork of the Devourer.<br /><br />The Devourer has no name, no form, no being. It is less a god than a primal force of the universe&mdash;an embodiment of malicious entropy, concerned only with the obliteration of all reality. Heedless of the meaningless existence of life in all its myriad forms, it cannot be reasoned with, delayed, or halted, and it largely ignores the pleas and prayers of even its most devout worshipers. Some cosmologists and theologians postulate that when the Devourer has consumed everything and the mortal world expires, the Devourer will give birth to a new universe in place of the old, but the crazed cultists who venerate the Star-Eater as a god know this for the foolishly hopeful lie that it is. There will be no rebirth, no second creation&mdash;only an immeasurable void of nothingness.<br /><br />The church of the Devourer has little organization or leadership, only scattered, chaotic cults made up of berserkers, cannibals, nihilistic plotters, depraved reavers, and ruthless solarians. While many of the faithful prey upon nearly every sentient being they encounter, reveling in destruction and mayhem, some members possess a cunning knack for planning, carefully engineering catastrophes and triggering disasters to maximize the loss of life and ruination of property and resources. Devourer cults are outlawed on nearly every civilized world, but hidden shrines can be found on remote asteroids and abandoned moons, and many cults form motley flotillas of ships that attack and slaughter all they come across in the depths of space.<br /><br />While the Devourer can be represented by a simple black dot or swirl&mdash;representations of the final collapse of spacetime&mdash; the most common symbol is the Blood Accretion: a black hole with swirling red in its accretion disk. When the end finally comes, Devourer cultists believe, space-time itself will weep the blood of the gods before finally passing into nothing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/devourer.webp"}

Her detachment stems not from arrogance but from confidence in her own abilities and her desire to be unburdened by troubles. She is a collection of contrasts&mdash;a traveler who cares nothing for her destination, a carefree creature of instinct haunted by a past stretching back eons, and a peaceful deity forced to battle with old enemies, eternally young despite the weight of ages and stars upon her. Some may believe Desna to be flighty, frivolous, and easily distracted, but she also has a cold side born of battle, loss, and tragedy.<br /><br />Desna communicates with her followers through dreams, encouraging them to believe in themselves, indulge their desires, experience all they can, express their inner strengths, and trust instinct as a guide. As the goddess of luck, she believes that fortune favors the bold and knows that there&rsquo;s always a chance of success, just as she knows that dreams can become nightmares. Desna watches over dreamers and travelers of all kinds, and she teaches that it&rsquo;s better to ask forgiveness than permission and that a split-second decision is often required to seize a unique opportunity.<br /><br />Those who worship Desna don&rsquo;t go out of their way to pick fights and would rather walk away from the possibility of a physical conflict if possible. However, if they have no other choice or if leaving would mean innocents would get hurt, they try to end the battle quickly, using nonlethal methods when appropriate but otherwise not holding back.<br /><br />Despite existing for eons, Desna and her faith have changed little since the pre-Gap era. She has a palace within the star Cynosure, a location said to be equidistant from all systems that worship the Song of the Spheres. Many of Desna&rsquo;s faithful carry a </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"><em>@Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.PykTIne4D2uTVgJM]{Starknife}</em>, whose shape has long been associated with the goddess.

Gamblers and thieves pray to Desna for luck, and few travelers board ships bound for distant stars without at least whispering a prayer to the Song of the Spheres. The Desnan church has little organization, and though shrines to Desna can be found in almost any place visited by space travelers, she has few fully staffed temples of size. Most commercial starships have a small chapel or shrine to Desna for their passengers&rsquo; use, and many private vessels carry a small idol or image of Desna or her symbol.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/desna.webp"}

Though dead for millennia, its body still gives off light and heat, presumably amplifying what it absorbs from the sun. Igneous rocks and other rubble pockmark the creature’s mineral skin, indicating that this celestial object may have undergone many meteor showers during a long geological history. Moss-like plants also grow in scattered areas, and small insectile life-forms burrow just under the surface—all sustained by Hawanna’s thin atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Hawanna also boasts a sentient species, known as kaa-lekis . Kaa-lekis have built no cities on the planet, preferring to wander Hawanna’s sparkling hills and moss fields in extended family groups and live off the land’s natural gifts. Planet-wide leadership rotates among the heads of the major families every two years. While each family follows its own small traditions, all kaa-lekis venerate Hawanna as a formerly living creature; their tales hint that their people evolved somewhere else and found refuge on Hawanna. A small percentage of the population, calling themselves “the Children of Hawanna,” believe that the planet may one day be resurrected through prayer and science.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">No one is certain of Hawanna’s former anatomy, as the creature likely died thousands of years ago, possibly even before the Gap. With what little can be gleaned from examinations of Hawanna’s surface and interior, scientists have yet to definitively discover another creature of its kind. Some believe Hawanna was a massive being similar to a novaspawn whose solar parturition went awry, while others posit that the crystalline creature originated from a different universe.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Proponents of the “different universe” theory point to the unusual crystalline constructs that roam the caves and tunnels under Hawanna’s surface. They seem unique to Hawanna, and scholars aren’t sure where they came from or who builds them. Most kaa-lekis believe them to be evolved versions of Hawanna’s natural internal defense mechanisms and harm them only in self-defense. This happens more often than kaa-lekis care to admit, as their crews of “reapers” who descend underground to harvest crystals used to manufacture sonic weapons and other equipment regularly come into conflict with Hawanna’s constructs.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Since being contacted by Pact Worlds explorers almost a decade ago, Hawannan society has been altered, and some would say not for the better. Many kaa-lekis have adopted elements of various Pact Worlds styles, including the dress and technology of their visitors, while some have taken a more traditionalist stance. Rising trade has exacerbated the rift between these two factions; demand continues to grow for Hawanna’s crystals, which were recently discovered to be able to boost processing power and energy efficiency in most computers.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">An agreement with Pact Worlds traders highly regulates exports from the planet, with the current Hawanna leadership having final say on the exact numbers. The government allows only a small amount of trade, so smuggling Hawanna’s crystals has become increasingly common.</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Aliens found at Hawanna</h1>\n<p>Kaa-leki - CR 8; Medium humanoid (kaa-leki, plantlike)</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

In this way he also teaches the fundamental equality of all creatures&mdash;even gods&mdash;and encourages his congregation to treat all people well, for even the most grotesque sinner or alien monstrosity might be a secret messiah. While these avatars of the divine occasionally reveal themselves to protect the innocent or lead the faithful in times of crisis, more often they simply travel, exploring the multiverse to the best of their mortal abilities, until death folds their spark back into the divine flame.<br /><br />While @JournalEntry[KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Desna} advocates travel for travel&rsquo;s sake, Weydan expounds the virtues of voyaging with an end goal in mind, even if the goal is simply discovery. Exploring the unknown is a sacred process that reveals as much about the explorer as about the star system or world being explored. The universe contains a wealth of wonders just waiting to be discovered, and Weydan takes joy in every discovery his followers make, no matter how small or how significant. He and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna} share a love of liberty, and Weydan believes in every sentient species&rsquo; right to freedom, unfettered by restrictive laws. He regards equality for people from all walks of life as the foundation of that freedom and an essential requirement for a thriving society. As such, he opposes slavery and any system that advances one being&rsquo;s privileges by causing another&rsquo;s oppression, which often puts him at odds with @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.vIgmW8C54qgxPqUg]{Abadar}&rsquo;s capitalist teachings.<br /><br />Envoys, explorers, gnostics, socialists, Starfinders (see page 479), and colonists heading to new homes on recently discovered planets make up the majority of Weydan&rsquo;s followers and priests. Many @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Androids}, especially those fighting against oppression, venerate Weydan, as do young @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} rebelling against the strict traditions of their culture, or shirrens appreciating his succor of the downtrodden. Befitting the egalitarian nature of his faith, Weydan&rsquo;s church does not have much of a hierarchy.

According to the most prominent theories, the people of Amran fought the Swarm, but when it became clear that defeat was inevitable, they settled on a bold tactic.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Frontline forces bought time against the Swarm while Amran&rsquo;s great minds built machines, so-called &ldquo;ghost forges,&rdquo; imbued with artificial intelligence and the entire library of Amran&rsquo;s knowledge. These machines were mystically engineered to collect souls as they passed from Amran, then technomancers sent these machines to the Ethereal Plane. As the people of Amran fell to the Swarm&rsquo;s inexorable assault, these ghost forges gathered their willing souls, storing them safely while the Swarm consumed the physical planet. An indeterminate time after the Swarm&rsquo;s departure, the ghost forges phased back to the Material Plane and manufactured living robot bodies for the stored souls, infusing them with the accumulated knowledge of their civilization. The reborn then set about re-creating their world&rsquo;s devoured ecology and infrastructure in mechanical form.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">These living machines had escaped annihilation, but they could not have predicted the Gap, which wiped the mystic records from the ghost forges as it twisted records across time. After the Gap, the reborn reawakened in their mechanical paradise with little of the scientific or magical knowledge they had possessed, no understanding of how their society functioned, and little idea of who they were individually, much less as a people. Even their original name for themselves was lost. They had a rudimentary understanding of their origins and the machines that had saved them, leading them to adopt the name &ldquo;amrantah,\" as they were the sole people on the world of Amran.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">In the centuries since, Amran received the Signal, built numerous Drift beacons (having forgotten the Swarm), and has become famous as a destination for artistry, entertainment, innovation, and pleasure. The ghost forges maintain and control the cities and environment, while the amrantahs maintain a light hand in governance, focusing on diversion and invention. They have created a new culture and, over time, regained some of their prior technomagical prowess. Amrantahmanufactured technology is increasingly synonymous with bleeding-edge design.<br /><br />The following locations are well known on Amran.<br /><br /><strong>Chromium Coliseum:</strong> One of the few massive structures the ghost forges did not build, this gigantic arena is among the great gladiatorial experiences in known space. With a vast degree of customization both physical and magical, including gravity, lovers of battle converge from innumerable systems to watch and compete in the stadium&rsquo;s regular games. The ghost forges offer healing and other rewards for competitors, making participation easy. Amrantah gladiators also test new techniques regularly, making this battleground a great place to learn and practice the art of combat. Events from this coliseum are broadcast across the galaxy, so a warrior who wants to make a name can do so here.<br /><br /><strong>Diastrega:</strong> The most famous (or infamous) of Amran&rsquo;s cities, Diastrega is as well known for its lighthearted, morally lax atmosphere as for its stunning variety of diversions. Nearly any socially acceptable experience is available, from immersive holographic roleplaying games to amrantah-staffed brothels. As is usual on Amran, Diastrega&rsquo;s amrantah council rules with a light hand, being more interested in their own affairs. Establishments maintain private security to keep order among visitors. Unfortunately for all pleasure-seekers, the lack of oversight gives criminals and other ne&rsquo;er-do-wells opportunities for mischief and worse. Private investigators are as likely to make a good living in Diastrega, as are professional entertainers.</span></span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

There, he encountered something that changed him for the worse, and when he returned, he had become a new god of pain, suffering, and loss.<br /><br />Zon-Kuthon is a twisted, cruel, jealous god who defiles flesh to bring pain and misery. He represents debilitating loss, consuming envy, emotional darkness, and ever-present pain. Unrepentantly evil, he finds only brief joy in the pain he causes others. His very existence is a corruption and parasite upon the universe. His alien mind constantly seeks new ways to oppress, humiliate, demoralize, and destroy others, but his true goals are incomprehensible. The Midnight Lord offers no great wisdoms, no promises of universal truth, and no guarantee of rewards in the afterlife. It&rsquo;s possible that this bleak nihilism may be part of some more elaborate master plan unknowable to even his greatest priests, but so far the method and message is that existence itself is pain.<br /><br />Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s faith attracts evil sadists, demented masochists, and those whose spirits are so wounded that only overwhelming pain distracts them from their sorrows. He whips the minds of serial killers, guides the hands of torturers, and plays upon the nerves of the suffering. He is the patron of slave masters, back-alley surgeons, and those driven to madness by envy and loss&mdash; people so injured that they come to revel in pain or joyfully inflict the same upon others. His priests, known as the Servants of Midnight, seek to pierce the veil of the Great Beyond and expose themselves to what lies there, hoping to achieve the same apotheosis as Zon-Kuthon himself. His church has no overarching organizational tenets beyond bringing pain to the universe, yet it still manages to remain a major presence due to the discoveries of the Joyful Things&mdash;voluntary amputees whose lack of limbs or sensory organs leaves them plenty of time to design ever more sinister devices for Kuthite arms dealers (such as shadowdrives, which were popular before the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{Drift} travel among those willing to trade excruciating pain for speed). Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s temples are torture chambers, both in appearance and function, and worship services always incorporate torture and selfmutilation, blurring the line between pleasure and pain.<br /><br />Of Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s sibling, Shelyn, much remains unknown. Though not silent, her responses to worshipers are infrequent and fractured, leading some to believe she&rsquo;s traveling beyond the known multiverse in search of a cure for her brother&rsquo;s ancient, yet still mysterious condition.</span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/zon_kuthon.webp"}

Like most stars, the sun is an incredibly inhospitable place, almost incomprehensibly hot, with pressures capable of crushing ordinary starships like overripe fruit. In its heart, the massive energies unleashed regularly tear holes to the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of Fire, giving birth to whale-like fire elementals and plasma oozes that roil and breach in its photosphere, as well as certain efreet, salamanders, and intelligent flame-dwelling creatures with the supernatural ability to withstand the sun&rsquo;s tremendous pressure and heat.<br /><br />Though largely left alone by the Pact Worlds, the sun nevertheless attracts a few ordinary humanoid residents; of these, members of the Church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae} are by far the most common, as befits worshipers of the sun goddess. Roughly a century ago, Sarenite scholars orbiting and observing the star discovered an anomaly: a collection of inexplicable and deserted bubble-cities, tethered together by magic and somehow floating unburnt within the sun&rsquo;s flaming seas. What&rsquo;s more, as they approached, the Sarenites found a magical tunnel opening miraculously in the sun&rsquo;s fire, allowing them to approach the cities without being destroyed. Though it&rsquo;s still not known who built the cities, how they were constructed, or why they were abandoned&mdash;mysteries scholars and engineers desperately study&mdash;the Burning Archipelago quickly became the church&rsquo;s most sacred settlement.<br /><br />Today, the Radiant Cathedral in the central bubble attracts worshipers and scientists from all across the system. Gleaming Sarenite sunskimmers use stellar sails to soar dangerously close to the sun&rsquo;s corona, servicing the orbital power stations that gather solar energy or magically bottle nuclear fire for resale. In slightly safer orbits, various corporate outfits fly robotic tankships full of algae genetically engineered to capture that same energy via advanced photosynthesis. Corporations also operate solar-powered robotics plants and so-called &ldquo;jungle boxes&rdquo; in which modified plants extrude rare and complex chemicals. These last are somewhat controversial, as the extreme magic and genetic engineering used to mutate ordinary plants can sometimes twist organisms more than their corporate creators initially intended. Twice in the last year, various jungle boxes operated by NatuReal Compounds Ltd. have gone feral, with sentient plant creatures roaming the halls and devouring the attendant crew. Fortunately, most jungle box operators have learned (somewhat) from the scandal and have gone entirely automated&mdash;yet they still need to quietly hire independent operators to accompany their repair technicians any time a box goes dark.<br /><br />In addition to visitors from the Pact Worlds, trade delegations from the Plane of Fire regularly use the Burning Archipelago to meet with Material Plane contacts. These dignitaries have much to offer, but perhaps the most interesting information they bring to the table is word of strange ruins and whole empires of fire-immune creatures&mdash;some even humanoid&mdash;floating within the sun&rsquo;s deeper layers, as yet unreachable by outside races. Combined with the apparently vast age of the bubble-cities, this news leads some scholars to wonder whether the sun might harbor clues to the first races to arise in the system, perhaps even the legendary First Ones of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}. Many different organizations quietly monitor the sun&rsquo;s surface in hopes of making contact with these solar dwellers or claiming new artifacts forced to the surface by stellar convection. Yet, if these so-called &ldquo;deep cultures&rdquo; are truly progenitors of the Pact Worlds races, why have they staunchly refused to respond to the messages and shielded probes dropped into the sun&rsquo;s depths? And why do the efreet and other elemental travelers seem so scared to speak of them? Of late, one particular theory has been sweeping the conspiracy centers of the bubble-cities&rsquo; infosphere: the idea that the energy is so great at the center of the sun that time itself begins to warp, making the civilizations in the sun&rsquo;s depths not representatives of the past but of the future.<br /><br />While the sun is officially held in common by all of the Pact Worlds, the Burning Archipelago is considered an independent protectorate, and its citizens are afforded the right to self-govern. Though the bubble-cities are very close to theocracies, thanks to the heavy Sarenite element, each one has its own unique flavor, from the heavily religious central bubble of Dawnshore to the more corporate Fireside or Stellacuna with its science labs.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/sun.webp"}

The trench-like scars across Gadravel, visible from space, hint at an ancient destruction wreaked by some unknown force or super weapon that also wiped out every living thing on the planet. In the decades since its rediscovery, the unquiet spirits of Gadravel&rsquo;s slaughtered populace have swallowed a dozen scientific research expeditions and countless opportunists and explorers. Scavengers come in search of forgotten technology or unclaimed plunder, while pirates seek refuge among the silent streets of abandoned cities, hoping to shake off pursuit by bounty hunters. Those who alight on the planet&rsquo;s surface and leave within an hour or two often escape with fantastic riches and intriguing components of baffling alien technology. Those who linger too long are devoured by the ghosts and remain on the planet for a torturous eternity.<br />Gadravel is the solitary world orbiting the star now identified as Iolanchee. Ruined temples at the center of several of the planet&rsquo;s cities seem to be dedicated to a small pantheon of unknown deities associated with the sun and Gadravel&rsquo;s four moons, now all gone. A jagged, spinning shard of the largest of these satellites still orbits dangerously close to Gadravel&rsquo;s surface, while the other three crashed into the planet untold eons ago&mdash;presumably in the same cataclysm that devastated Gadravel&mdash;to carve the deep chasms that mar the landscape. Very little atmosphere remains, leaving Gadravel prey to countless meteorites and comet strikes that further push the planet toward oblivion.<br />In addition to these many craters, Gadravel&rsquo;s surface shows signs of being the center of a terrible conflict: constructed fortifications and trenches crisscross ancient battlefields, and pieces of technology that many believe came from engines of war litter the city streets. No one is certain if the populace fought among themselves or were conquered by an outside force. Beyond obscure illustrations in a few scattered texts whose strange characters defy translation, Gadravel&rsquo;s history has been lost. That said, anyone who ventures to the planet&rsquo;s surface soon gets to meet Gadravel&rsquo;s former inhabitants.<br />Gadravel&rsquo;s unquiet dead appear as floating, alien skulls cloaked in mantles of darkness. Under ordinary conditions, they seek only to consume the life force of visitors and add them to their undead legions, but scattered reports of unusual behavior toward explorers who bear aeon stones hints at an intriguing possibility regarding the doomed planet&rsquo;s fate, and the entity that may have delivered it. The ghosts of Gadravel treat anyone bearing an aeon stone with great reverence, and obey anyone with more than three aeon stones as if they were a great leader or even a god. Word of this unusual behavior has started to circulate among the criminals of Near Space, and more and more ships are venturing there every year with malicious intent.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

After gnawing on the corpse of a dead god, however, she absorbed some of that deity&rsquo;s divine power and became a goddess herself. Originally a goddess of night, Lao Shu Po has turned her focus more to those who prowl under cover of darkness. Hers is the poisoned cup, the dagger in the back, and the starship power core rigged to explode. She keeps her eyes and ears always open, for an incautious moment or a careless word might reveal a secret that she can later turn to her advantage.<br /><br />Lao Shu Po remembers her humble beginnings, and she teaches that those who have nothing should do whatever they can get away with or whatever it takes to survive, be it murder, sabotage, or theft. The universe gives away nothing for free, and it&rsquo;s up to the individual to take what she needs or wants and jealously hide it away. It may sometimes be advisable to band together with others for strength and protection, like a pack of rats, but in the end, you can rely on no one but yourself. There will always be betrayal and lies; the key is to lie and betray before someone else does it to you.<br /><br />Assassins, smugglers, spies, thieves, and all who wish to hide their activities under cover of darkness and escape the notice of the authorities worship Lao Shu Po. She is widely regarded as a patron of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki} race, but most of the ratfolk pray to Grandmother Rat only to placate her and avoid her notice, rather than embracing her values. Nevertheless, a majority of her priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}, who use their ubiquity to foster underworld contacts for their congregations. Lao Shu Po&rsquo;s temples and shrines are few, always small and unassuming, and often hidden in plain sight&mdash;a back alley apothecary where @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} are sold, a dark chamber in the rear of a drug den, a disused corner in a space station&rsquo;s waste reclamation level, or a cramped warren of maintenance tunnels just beneath the streets of a bustling marketplace.<br /><br />While many societies root out and destroy cults of Lao Shu Po, further strengthening the faith&rsquo;s verminous association, there are always those in power who appreciate her followers&rsquo; ability to get things done. Completely trusting one of her followers&mdash;who refer to themselves as &ldquo;grandchildren&rdquo;&mdash;is foolish, but Grandmother Rat has no problem with her followers staying loyal to an employer or cause so long as it serves their ends.

In ages past, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathan} storytellers gathered their clans around the fire and taught them the stories of their past, the traditions of their clan, and the history of their people. Tradition holds that as they did so, these first stories began to take form, breathed into life and awareness by the blending of ideas and the fundamental magic inherent in language and communication. Thus was Talavet born&mdash;not just a storyteller, but the story itself, a god embodying all the tales and legends of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} race. She is communal memory, a representation of the bonds that hold the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas}&mdash;and to some extent all races&mdash; together and connect them to their ancestral home.<br /><br />Talavet teaches that tradition is the most important link in the chain of history that binds a community together and that ancient legends, myths, and stories form the solid foundation of an ordered society. Naturally, the Gap was a tremendous blow to her church&mdash;with many seeing it as a form of divine punishment&mdash; yet in the centuries since, her shattered congregation has reforged itself, stronger for having survived what they now call the Time of Silence. Her followers believe in sharing wisdom for the benefit of all and looking to the past as a guide to the present and the future. But especially in light of the Gap, they also know that there are times when records fail or you cannot rely on the community&rsquo;s aid, and so you must learn to trust yourself and your own personal traditions, just as a young @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} must undergo the Tempering to discover himself and become an adult.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, kasathas make up the majority of Talavet&rsquo;s worshipers and priests, but the Storyteller&rsquo;s faith has also gained a significant number of followers among the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}, who both have their own tight-knit bonds of family and community, as well as the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, who find much to agree with in the goddess&rsquo;s focus on tradition and self-reliance. These same tenets attract @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.fqYiP2f9oSfcmrwC]{Envoys} and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.uf8ADOAeBrtUkPVl]{Operatives} to Talavet&rsquo;s church, as well as @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}, the inheritors of the ancient </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha}</span> philosophy of the Cycle.

Full churches often include a hearth with a flame that is always kept burning and feature red lighting that evokes memories of the kasathas&rsquo; original home star.<br /><br />While Talavet&rsquo;s church is generally easygoing and happy to work with members of other religions&mdash;for even the cruelest religions help to anchor their people&mdash;they have a long-standing feud with the church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep}, resenting the way that god&rsquo;s faithful twist stories into deadly secrets and conspiracies.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/talavet.webp"}

She warred with evil beings that sought to plunge the newborn planets into eternal darkness, and emerged victorious&mdash;yet some of those who had turned to evil saw their wickedness revealed by Sarenrae&rsquo;s glory, and in repentance they were forgiven. Sarenrae is kind and loving&mdash;a figure of healing, guidance, and light. Yet for all her compassion, Sarenrae is also a powerful force against evil and strikes down the irredeemable without mercy.<br /><br />Sarenrae is generally seen as the goddess of the Pact Worlds&rsquo;&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.PrA66Lezqc5yx4uM]{Sun}</span>, which her faithful sometimes call the Dawnflower&rsquo;s Star in her honor, but she draws power from suns across the universe. She is a deity of boundless love&mdash;a caring mother, sister, and protector of all in need. She delights in healing the sick, lifting up the fallen, and shining a guiding light into the darkest hearts and worlds. Sarenrae brushes off insults but responds to violence and predations upon the innocent with cleansing fire and scorching light. Ancient and timeless, Sarenrae stands fearlessly against the tide of darkness, promising that the dawn will always come, and when it does, hope, kindness, and truth will triumph.<br /><br />The Dawnflower&rsquo;s faithful come from all walks of life: everyday folk who rejoice in the light of the sun, take comfort in love and compassion, and believe strongly in redemption and righteous action. Though @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}&nbsp;often describe Sarenrae as one of &ldquo;their&rdquo; gods, the tradition of sun worship is common in societies that rely on the sun&rsquo;s light for energy and nourishment, and thus most cultures within the Pact Worlds and beyond have worshiped Sarenrae to a significant extent at some point. After @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens} are perhaps the race most attracted to Sarenrae&rsquo;s faith and her message of redemption and empathy. Many of her priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.fqYiP2f9oSfcmrwC]{Envoys}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers}&mdash;those who espouse peace and kindness until stirred to action by evil that cannot be redeemed. When possible, Sarenrae&rsquo;s temples are open to the sky, but they always have at least a window or skylight where the faithful can bask in the natural light of the sun.<br /><br />In the Pact Worlds, the spiritual heart of Sarenrae&rsquo;s church is within the sun itself, in the Burning Archipelago&rsquo;s central city of Dawnshore. Many Pact Worlds Sarenites feel an instinctive drive to make pilgrimages to this holy site, even though her faith is often individualistic, with the church serving as an organizing and training force for priests and followers who then wander the galaxy doing the goddess&rsquo;s work.</span><br /></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/sarenrae.webp"}

Her realm, the Boneyard, sits atop an impossibly tall spire overlooking the city-plane of Axis and is the final destination of the River of Souls, the metaphysical stream that carries the souls of dead mortals to her realm for judgment and subsequent assignment to an afterlife in the Outer Planes.<br /><br />The faithful say Pharasma is with any living creature in the universe from the instant it is born to the moment of its death. She sees all the possible choices facing a mortal at any given moment, as well as their long-term repercussions. And when that creature inevitably dies and goes before her to be judged, she and her army of psychopomps use this knowledge to send the souls to the reward or punishment they earned during their lives. No one escapes her decisions for long, and even the gods are judged by the Lady of Graves when they perish.<br /><br />Pharasma sternly observes both life and death, assigning afterlives in accordance with mortals&rsquo; characters but without a personal interest in either sin or righteousness. Despite being the goddess of death, she has no quarrel with magical healing and even resurrection, as she can read the lines of fate and knows the difference between a mortal&rsquo;s true death and a temporary state of nonbeing. However, she considers the undead a desecration of the memory of the flesh and a corruption of a soul&rsquo;s path to judgment, and she instructs her followers to destroy such abominations wherever they may be found. Those who create such monstrosities are to be treated similarly.<br /><br />Every species that lives and dies worships Pharasma to some extent, though many do so by different names or in forms unfamiliar to Pact World races. Her most devoted followers come from the ranks of diviners, expectant parents, morticians, and slayers of the undead. As befits her impartiality, most members of her church take a neutral stance regarding politics and other worldly concerns. The majority of Pharasma&rsquo;s priests in the Pact Worlds are @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics}, working as healers, midwives, and prophets, though she&rsquo;s also popular with warriors in some societies. All Pharasmin @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.aXgn2O25HtW7woS2]{Priests} are well-versed in the funerary rites and practices of at least their home culture, and many try to learn as many rites as possible in order to cater to a wider variety of people. While even the simplest cemetery is a shrine to the Lady of Graves, Pharasma&rsquo;s temples in the Pact Worlds tend to hearken back to an earlier age, taking the form of grand gothic cathedrals when circumstances allow, though usually still adjacent to a crematorium, graveyard, or other place of rest.</span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/pharasma.webp"}

Even the equatorial lowlands rarely warm past 65 degrees, and Vohxa&rsquo;s native life is limited to spindly and resilient trees, hardy shrubs, and passive herd animals that graze the frozen plains or climb the rocky slopes. But at some point during the Gap, Vohxa became a home for many cold-weather species indigenous to other planets, such as high-flying niaqs, sharpwings, lumbering wollipeds and even the occasional silver dragon. No one is quite sure how so many creatures from other planets came to dwell here.<br /><br />Vohxa was discovered by accident when a mining vessel crewed by dwarves and humans experienced a hazard in the Drift and emerged far from its original course. But the presence of familiar life on the planet spurred the crew&rsquo;s curiosity, and the intrepid miners soon discovered the world was rich in siccatite, as well as other more mundane resources. Finding the planet had no native sapient life, the miners decided to settle there and used the mining equipment mounted on their starship to dig the foundation for Tahxia, now the planet&rsquo;s largest settlement; there, dwarves, humans, and shirrens who followed after escaping the Swarm established homes in warm, comfortable, and expansive subterranean chambers.<br /><br />The people of Vohxa are hardy, hard-working, and fiercely loyal to their home, family, and neighbors. Modern mining facilities rise up from across the world&rsquo;s surface, scarring the planet&rsquo;s majestic landscape with dingy metal towers and refineries that release a steady stream of chemicals into Vohxa&rsquo;s water and air. Virtually all of its economy is based on mining and related industries&mdash;the precious gems and metals taken from its mines are highly coveted throughout the galaxy&mdash;and there&rsquo;s little else to draw visitors here.<br /><br />Recently, war has come to Vohxa. The discovery of ancient hobgoblin ruins in Vohxa&rsquo;s southern hemisphere gave the Gideron Authority an excuse to invade. Local defense forces were no match for the Authority&rsquo;s fleet of interstellar warships, and now the Authority all but rules the planet&rsquo;s surface, where they have set up command posts, barracks, armories, and labor camps exploiting Vohxa&rsquo;s population to work the mines under cruel and inhumane conditions. Families have been separated, settlements reduced to rubble, and lives cast aside as the Authority pillages Vohxa in support of a xenophobic and militant agenda.

The fractured remains of these two worlds spin lazily in their new orbits, and though there are more than a million celestial bodies with diameters greater than a mile within @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, all are spaced far enough apart that they rarely collide with one another. Most of these planetoids consist of formless chunks of rock or ice, though a few still hold traces of the civilizations of Damiar and Iovo. Some have just enough gravity&mdash;or technological assistance&mdash;to hold a thin atmosphere, while others are devoid of breathable gases. Dust and tiny pieces of stone and metal float between the asteroids, occasionally posing a threat to ships passing through at speed.<br /><br />The true dangers of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, however, are the beings that inhabit the asteroids. Smugglers and space pirates&mdash;especially the Free Captains of Broken Rock&mdash;store their ill-gotten goods on various rocks; some protect their stashes with high-tech security, while others hide their lairs in plain sight on otherwise nondescript chunks of stone. Many planetoids rich in minerals and other resources have been claimed by various mining companies&mdash;the most prominent being several dwarven star citadels&mdash;often all too eager to fight to protect their interests. In addition, androids calling themselves the Refugists have recently begun construction of their own home world by pulling together asteroids with tractor beams and gravity guns. Whether or not they&rsquo;ll succeed at this endeavor has yet to be seen, but rumor has them approaching their work with almost religious fervor and little patience for interruptions.<br /><br />All of this, of course, ignores @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}&rsquo;s indigenous residents. Called @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians}, these humanoids supposedly descend from the natives of the lost twin planets, evolved and adapted to life in hard vacuum. Able to suspend respiration indefinitely, they soar between the lonely asteroids on wings of pure energy stretched impossibly long to catch the solar wind. Sometimes referred to as &ldquo;angels&rdquo;&mdash;both derisively and admiringly&mdash;the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians} maintain a number of carefully terraformed &ldquo;cr&egrave;che worlds&rdquo; within the belt where they can relax and raise their children. While usually peaceful, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians} have never forgotten their ancient feud with @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, which they believe was responsible for their worlds&rsquo; destruction. Like many of their neighbors, the </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians}</span> send representatives to the Pact Council in order to make their views known, yet they have no overarching government capable of taking them beyond the status of a Pact World protectorate, instead following a libertarian philosophy of holding on to what they have and allowing others to do the same.<br /><br />With a 600-mile diameter, Nisis is the largest body in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Under its crust of ice, this planetoid is mostly composed of fresh water, an immense mass of liquid home to aquatic predators that have claimed the lives of countless would-be colonists. Only small enclaves of sarcesians live in inverted dome-villages clinging to the underside of the planet&rsquo;s ice crust, and the settlers are always on high alert for threats from below, ready to abandon their homes and retreat to strongholds on the planetoid&rsquo;s surface at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The water of Nisis also serves as the source of the River Between, a strange waterway surrounded by atmosphere in a cylindrical containment field, which flows through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} and connects many of the asteroids and cr&egrave;che worlds. The River Between used to be a well-used way to travel quickly through the asteroid belt, but recently the water has turned dark, and sailors have begun reporting vicious attacks by unseen creatures. Traffic on the river has dropped precipitously since the coming of these &ldquo;diaspora wyrms,&rdquo; and some scientists have noted that both the attacks and the change in the waterway coincided with another inexplicable event: Nisis started slowly growing in size.<br /><br />Among many famous Diasporan locations is the House of the Void, a mysterious asteroid monastery whose black-robed monks stay tight-lipped about their goals. On the other side of the belt, the hollow asteroid known as the Wailing Stone now sits empty. Long ago, miles of silent corridors were drilled into the rock and used to quarantine victims of some terrible madness, and they later served as a penal colony&mdash;before all the residents vanished at some point during the Gap. Attempts to recolonize the stone have so far failed, as all who remain longer than a few days report disturbing nightmares and glimpses of twisted figures dressed in yellow rags.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/the_diaspora.webp"}

Through these rings swim vast oma space-whales, straining nutrients and tiny elementals from the dust with their energy baleen, while down in the planet&rsquo;s cloud layers floats a complex ecosystem ranging from air plants and giant bacteria to apex predators such as deadly keji swarms or the infamous tarenake, visible only by the gas it displaces. As you descend into the planet&rsquo;s denser cloud strata, predators get larger and more piscine, capturing prey with vampiric tentacles, magical fields, or acid-coated web nets. Many upper-layer creatures drop their gas-filled eggs through these layers into even deeper strata, where the eggs eventually reach neutral buoyancy and gestate in the increased heat and pressure, away from their usual predators.<br /><br />Through this gaseous wilderness float the Dreamers, Liavara&rsquo;s most prominent&mdash;and most confusing&mdash;intelligent race. Nearly identical to the gelatinous barathus of neighboring @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}, Liavara&rsquo;s Dreamers lack their kindred&rsquo;s collectivist culture or ability to combine consciousnesses, instead swooping through the skies in complex social interactions still mostly unintelligible to outsiders. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RXNBF1w6yXaB8P9O]{Barathu} legend says that the Dreamers were originally colonists from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda} who flew to the thenuninhabited world, only to quickly devolve&mdash;or ascend&mdash;into a state described alternately as feral or enlightened. With little interest in outside cultures and none at all in economics or governance, the Dreamers are best known for their prophetic songs predicting some great or terrible event to come&mdash;the Dreamers themselves make no distinction between the two.<br /><br />Given this relative lack of civilization, Liavara would have long since been taken over by other races if not for the barathus&rsquo; fierce insistence that the planet be left as a refuge for these pseudoholy entities. Not officially a member of the Pact&mdash;though many of its moons are&mdash;Liavara is technically a protectorate administrated exclusively by </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}</span>, which keeps a careful watch on the humanoid gas-mining ventures and floating city-platforms allowed to operate here. While most of the gases making up the planet are ordinary elements such as hydrogen and helium, the planet also harbors many rare gases, such as metasterium (useful in a variety of genetic engineering and mutation processes) and the magic-enhancing thaumogen, popular as both a magical crafting agent and a performance enhancing drug for technomancers (but highly illegal due to its sanity-eroding side effects). Many speculators believe that there are still far more unique, valuable compounds and organisms drifting in the deep layers of the planet, and despite the hazardous conditions and strict prohibitions by Brethedan overseers, many corporations still quietly contract out for deep dive explorations, made all the more risky by the need for absolute secrecy.<br /><br />Far more welcoming than Liavara itself are the planet&rsquo;s independent moons. The most prominent of these is heavily populated Arkanen, which constantly bleeds off its atmosphere, only to replenish it each year when its eccentric orbit takes it through Liavara&rsquo;s own upper atmosphere. Extremely dangerous storms arise as huge lightning bolts arc between the two worlds, harnessed by resident scientists and spellcasters alike. This orbit should be impossible according to normal physical models, which leads many to believe that the moon was built specifically as a power source. What the arcane dynamo might have been designed to power remains unknown.<br /><br />After Arkanen, the most civilized moon is Osoro, a world of mountaintop settlements high above the seas of poisonous gas breathed out by the moon&rsquo;s jungles. Here, solar-powered gliders sail between inhabited areas, while corrosion-resistant vessels dive down into the roiling clouds to study the ruins of a lost age. Heavily populated Nchak is close behind; a world of arthropods ruled by pulsating philosopher worms and the mortal incarnation of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.uBNlQguFvGTFLHSA]{Hylax}, it has become a religious and tourist mecca for many shirrens. Less visited is Melos, a mysterious world whose entire population vanished in what may have been a rapturous religious ascendance or a more sinister event, though it remains a treasure trove for archaeologists and salvagers. Isolated Hallas has been kept carefully cordoned off since even before the Gap, lest unprepared contact with the resident hyperevolved energy beings cause outsiders&rsquo; brains to explode from overstimulation.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Liavara</h2>\n<p>Dreamer, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"qRyqEWrhbMpdsY0v\"> Keji Swarm</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"tnwoxVsO6UtVq0fH\"> Kriegakos</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"W7k28lNRMmtO1FmL\"> Rauzhant</a></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/liavara.webp"}

Urgathoa&rsquo;s existence is a corruption of the natural order; some say her first divine footprints upon the soil of the Material Plane birthed plague and infection and that the first undead shadows and wraiths were born of her breath.<br /><br />Urgathoa is an utterly amoral, hedonistic goddess, concerned only with sating her own desires, regardless of the consequences others might suffer. To the Pallid Princess, the dull existence of a dead soul is pointless and tedious compared to the vibrant intensity of mortal or undead sensation, so her followers indulge in gluttonous depravity, attempting to cram as much sensation into existence as possible. Urgathoa&rsquo;s faith embraces breaking and surpassing taboos, so nothing is forbidden. Asceticism and self-restraint are repugnant&mdash;unless they are themselves part of some obsessive and gluttonous game&mdash;and the unrestrained excess of undeath is a state to aspire to.<br /><br />Creatures of passion and vice who believe that the universe is their playground are drawn to Urgathoa&rsquo;s church, as are those who worship death and revere disease. Most of her followers are insatiable gluttons, sinister necromancers, undead creatures, or those who seek undeath for themselves. They demand experience without limits or repercussions and perpetually chase hedonistic sensation. Although the church of Urgathoa is primarily interested in undeath, some cults focus on her gluttonous aspect, indulging in lavish orgies and decadent feasts of food and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drugs}. The vices of those who worship Urgathoa tend to become ever stranger and more demanding as they advance in her service. Urgathoa&rsquo;s faith is shunned, if not outright banned, on most civilized worlds, but the undead inhabitants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} openly worship the Pallid Princess, and many cities have secret clubs dedicated to her, often servicing the bored elite. Urgathoa&rsquo;s temples are built like feast halls, usually adjacent to a graveyard or crypt inhabited by loyal undead creatures.<br /><br />Priests of Urgathoa are usually mystics or envoys, but people of all talents can be seduced by her promises. Interestingly, her faithful are split on the issue of technological life extension: while some eagerly pursue virtual immortality through methods like consciousness uploads, traditionalists fear that this sidestepping of magical undeath may gradually lessen the goddess&rsquo;s influence. Others see it as a nonissue, expecting it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VQrVznzrr85I90TI]{Pharasma} and her minions forcibly close such loopholes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/urgathoa.webp"}

Science can explain all of these and more, but the magnificence of the cosmos knows no bounds, and there are always new miracles and mysteries waiting to be discovered, explored, and explained. Ibra itself is one of these cosmic enigmas. It has no gender or defined physical form, and it&rsquo;s unclear whether Ibra is a deity who sprang into being when the universe was born, some alien paragon who ascended to godhood, or a personification of the cosmos itself.<br /><br />Ibra&rsquo;s followers believe that one can find truth, serenity, and meaning in the beauty of the cosmos, but it is up to the individual to decipher the universe&rsquo;s secrets to find these rewards. It is not Ibra&rsquo;s place to reveal the answers to creation&rsquo;s great questions, and the Inscrutable rewards those who push the boundaries of knowledge and science to explore the universe and bring its wonders to light. In Ibra&rsquo;s worldview, there is no law or chaos, no good or evil: only the questions raised by the shining light of a newborn star, the beautiful dance of heavenly bodies, and the perfect solitude of the comet as it hurtles through the dark, regardless of whether the answers to those questions are ever found.<br /><br />Astronomers, astrophysicists, cosmologists, mathematicians, and interstellar explorers worship Ibra as their patron, and many @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystic} and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarian} serve as the Inscrutable&rsquo;s priests.

No one in the Pact Worlds knows what species first venerated Ibra as a god, as the oldest discovered monuments to the deity have all been massive temple complexes on otherwise uninhabited worlds, including @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda's} tiny moon Chamari.<br /><br />Ibra&rsquo;s holy symbol is as inscrutable as the god itself. Found on the oldest temples, the golden shape is often assumed to be an eye, a compass, or perhaps a planet, with an arrow leading the faithful ever onward into the unknown. More obvious is the sixstar constellation inside the symbol, yet questions abound there as well.

Once a minor nautical deity revered on Golarion, Besmara is now venerated as a powerful goddess of pirates, conflict, and the alien leviathans that swim through the void. Some of her priests claim that Besmara took her current power and position as her prize when she deposed another deity in a daring raid, but as these events ostensibly took place during the Gap, they remain impossible to confirm. Besmara&rsquo;s ship, the <em>Starwraith</em>, sails through space and across the planes. Loyally crewed by sly and fearless pirates and spacers from countless worlds, the Starwraith shares a name with a constellation in the skies of the Pact Worlds, and many believe the two are actually one and the same.<br /><br />Besmara is brash, fickle, greedy, and lusty, but she follows her own code of honor and is loyal to her crew and allies as long as they remain useful and serve her interests. She scorns laws and civilization for the freedom and fortune of outer space, delighting only in battle, plunder, risk, and the thrill of the chase. Besmara does not concern herself with good or evil, but she disdains acts like senseless murder that bring no profit or reward. She revels in strife and trickery, and she believes that if she wants a thing someone else owns, it&rsquo;s only fair for her to take it.<br /><br />Many <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.races\" data-id=\"7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u\"> Vesk</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.themes\" data-id=\"in3kIU1U7JjTuCJ4\"> Mercenaries</a> worship Besmara in her role as the goddess of strife, but pirates, smugglers, war profiteers, and other criminals who profit from conflict make up the bulk of Besmara&rsquo;s followers. Even those pirates who normally eschew religion might still pray to Besmara to ward away her wrath, or they might toss a share of plunder out the airlock as tribute to the Pirate Queen to curry her favor. Such folk tend to be more superstitious than religious, however, so Besmara has few temples and little in the way of an organized church. Nevertheless, ports and space stations visited regularly by pirates often host small shrines to the goddess; similar altars can also be found on remote asteroids, on space hulks, and in starship graveyards.<br /><br />Most of the Free Captains (see page 476) pay at least lip service to Besmara, and many of them carry a small, valuable trinket (such as a chunk of rare mineral or an antique laser pistol stolen from an important starship captain) with them at all times, considering it bad luck to ever misplace the item. Some of these baubles have been passed down from Free Captain to Free Captain over the decades.</span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/besmara.webp"}

These short featery people are affable and wecloming, particularly when inviting off-worlders to their various competing beachside resorts, but they become unusually reticent when discussing their home planet&rsquo;s gravity. This silence doesn&rsquo;t stem from some species-wide secret, but rather a powerful reverence for their world and its strong pull. All yrgytchees, and a few other native species, manipulate gravity fields around them in instinctive, defensive ways. Yrgytchees have no formal religion or training that helps them hone these abilities&mdash;at least, none they share with visitors. Although technologically sophisticated, yrgytchees don&rsquo;t construct spaceships or even flying vehicles because leaving their world equals anathema and invites summary execution upon return. The only yrgytchees encountered away from Yrgytch are misanthropes or radicals who know the permanence of their self-imposed exile.

On the light side, known as Fullbright, scorched deserts host iron-hard plants and animals with photosynthesizing skin, while the partly frozen seas of Darkside offer a home to predators such as hoarbats and the infamous bloodbrothers, who trap prey within their own bodies in order to co-opt their circulatory systems. Between these two extremes runs the Ring of Nations, a temperate zone along the twilit terminator filled with gleaming skyscrapers, bustling spaceports, gorgeously manicured (and dizzyingly vertical) parkfarms, and high-speed bullet trains.<br /><br />Similar to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} but taller, with color-changing skin and mouselike black eyes, the native @Compendium[sfrpg.races.nyQVqNvwCFL2YVO7]{Verthani} have long been at the forefront of cybernetics, due in part to their traditional caste system. Under this ancient system, young adults chose membership in one of three groups: the Augmented, warriors and adventurers who modified their bodies with technology; the Pure Ones, who rejected all personal augmentation but dedicated themselves to food production, governance, and other domestic responsibilities; and the scarred God-Vessels, who served as living avatars of their deities, burning holy symbols called devotionals into their chests. To ensure that no group grew too powerful, Augmented and God-Vessels were only allowed to marry Pure Ones. Though this caste system is now seen as archaic, with most @Compendium[sfrpg.races.nyQVqNvwCFL2YVO7]{Verthani} augmenting themselves to one degree or another and paying only lip service (at best) to the old ways, many still credit the caste system with the head start that placed Verces at the cutting edge of implant technology.<br /><br />In addition to pioneering cybernetics, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.nyQVqNvwCFL2YVO7]{Verthani} were also one of the first races to adopt space exploration, voyaging between worlds in their dirigible-like aetherships. While the coming of Drift technology and increased interplanetary trade under the Pact have allowed other worlds to catch up, verthani pilots and interstellar explorers remain legendary, and their massive shipyards at Skydock&mdash;an ancient geosynchronous satellite reached via space elevator&mdash;are second to none. Long since replaced by more modern designs, retrofitted aethership pleasure yachts still serve as marks of style and status among Pact World elites, as do their high-end Terminator-brand racing skiffs.<br /><br />Since even before the Gap, the Ring of Nations has governed Verces&rsquo;s temperate zone. While all of the component countries maintain theoretical independence, in practice the coalition forms a single worldwide government, with representatives from each country participating in the planetary Grand Assembly. The success of this model led to the Pact Worlds adopting both its structure and the peacekeeping Stewards, and to this day Verces remains a firm supporter of the agreement, as well as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station's} closest ally. Citizens of the Ring of Nations freely pass between countries, and in places the Ring becomes a single vast city, skyscrapers glinting in the sun while its hive of shadowed lower levels blaze with neon and magic.<br /><br />Of course, not all Vercites recognize the Grand Assembly&rsquo;s authority. Beyond the terminator zone live scattered groups of rebels, from nomadic tribes and survivalist cults to criminal organizations and political exiles. Collectively termed the Outlaw Kingdoms, these fringe societies are generally ignored except when they raid Ring citizens or Ring-owned outposts, such as the vast Sun Farm solar plantations in Fullbright or Darkside&rsquo;s shelynium ice mines. Some groups, such as the ice-obsessed Ascetics of Nar in the frozen monastery called the Fastness of the Ordered Mind, trade regularly with Ring citizens, but most respectable Vercites steer clear of both darksiders and lightsiders&mdash;at least officially.<br /><br />For a planet so urban and densely settled along the terminator, Verces has a surprising amount of unexplored wilderness. Even those in the Outlaw Kingdoms, dwelling in their sun-baked huts or tunneling deep into the ice to reach the fertile seas beneath, inhabit only a tiny portion of their territory, leaving vast stretches of untouched wilds and strange ruins from unremembered eras. One of the strangest of these is Qidel, Aerie of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.PrA66Lezqc5yx4uM]{The Sun}, a strange tube-spire rising high out of the center of Fullbright and descending deep into the planet&rsquo;s mantle.

Four of the worlds are habitable and support thriving colonies and corporate industrial centers. As the colonies have stabilized and prospered, their inhabitants have begun exploring the rest of the system in greater detail.<br /><br />Cordrazar IV is a rocky, terrestrial world blanketed in thick clouds of sulfuric acid. Its dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide traps heat and creates enormous atmospheric pressure, producing intensely hot temperatures on the planet&rsquo;s surface. Only recently have probes from nearby colonies managed to penetrate Cordrazar IV&rsquo;s atmosphere, sending back data revealing a ravaged wasteland studded with mysterious and impossibly ancient ruins.<br /><br />Very little is known about these ruins, or their original inhabitants, as no known sapient being has yet set foot on the planet, but several expeditions have sent robotic orbiters and rovers to explore tiny portions of its crumbling cities. These expeditions are all too brief, as not even robots can survive long in Cordrazar IV&rsquo;s corrosive atmosphere, but they have uncovered some information. All the expeditions have dated the planet&rsquo;s ruins as millions of years old, far predating most civilizations in Near Space. They are clearly the vestiges of a highly advanced society; remote exploration has revealed sophisticated construction techniques and tantalizing glimpses of alien relics and ancient technologies that have miraculously survived the acidic atmosphere and the toll of time. Planetary scientists believe the world&rsquo;s original inhabitants may have been responsible for the runaway greenhouse effect in Cordrazar IV&rsquo;s atmosphere that ultimately made the world so inhospitable.<br /><br />Explorations on Cordrazar&rsquo;s other planets have turned up no trace of similar ruins; only Cordrazar IV seems to have been inhabited in the distant past. Researchers have uncovered evidence on all four habitable colony worlds that suggests that, rather than their ecologies forming naturally, they may have been terraformed. This has led to speculation that the mysterious inhabitants of Cordrazar IV were behind these terraforming efforts, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Why the terraformers seemingly never colonized these worlds is an added mystery.<br /><br />As word of the peculiar ruins on Cordrazar IV trickles out to the wider galaxy, the planet is sure to attract the attention of xenoanthropologists, xenoarchaeologists, xenobiologists, and more, as well as interest from less-reputable parties such as reckless would-be explorers, treasure seekers, and black marketeers trading in plundered alien artifacts. Already, some xenohistorians on the fringes of academia have begun claiming that Cordrazar IV is an outpost of the ancient empire of the sivvs, a species of supposed interstellar conquerors that was defeated millions of years ago, leaving behind only scattered caches of highly advanced hybrid technology and weapons&mdash;though it should be noted that the continued existence of the sivvs and their empire is very much in dispute in respectable academic circles.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Since the system&rsquo;s formation, the so-called Red Planet has lost much of the atmosphere and liquid water it once held due to the slowing of its liquid-iron core and the resulting weakening of its magnetosphere. Though this slow decline transpires on a geologic scale and Akiton remains hospitable to humanoid life&mdash;and indeed, its slowly expanding deserts and rock chasms are all that most of its resident species have ever known&mdash;it also offers a sad metaphor for the planet&rsquo;s dying economy.<br /><br />Prior to the discovery of hyperspace, Akiton was the center of its solar system&rsquo;s mining, production, and trade of thasteron, an ore instrumental in the creation of fuel for sublight interplanetary travel. Since the advent of Drift travel and a reduced need for long realspace flights, however, demand for thasteron has fallen, and the economic effects of the crash now play out in political squabbles and civil strife across the planet. Massive space barges that once shuttled ore between all the Pact Worlds now lie as rusting hulks in the middle of the deserts, empty save for squatters and scavengers, humanoid and otherwise. Residents whose ancestors were magnates and high-society debutantes now hunt trash-eating khefaks and dodge flying, tusk-winged norkasa in the shells of abandoned cities, toil as laborers in the few remaining mines or industrial trench-squats, or join the anarchic gangs who battle for territory on the open plains with the planet&rsquo;s more traditional nomadic peoples.<br /><br />Akiton today has no centralized government, and its cold deserts, dry seabeds, and frigid polar ice caps host neverending skirmishes and proxy wars between various cities, clans, corporations, tribes, and offworld factions. It&rsquo;s a world where unscrupulous business interests can engage in unregulated or morally questionable research and exploitation and where criminals, fugitives, and the lost come to escape justice, hide from their enemies, or try to make a fresh start.<br /><br />The planet&rsquo;s best-known urban centers are ancient cities such as Arl, with its passion for blood sports; Daza, the half-irradiated City of Fusion; and Maro with its fabled Thousand Lights, a vast trench city climbing its way up the walls of the Edaio Rift. In these dusty and flickering metropolises, Akiton&rsquo;s dreams of civilization and culture still remain&mdash;for the rich, at least&mdash;propped up by their remaining wealth and control of the planet&rsquo;s last few viable thasteron mines, as well as lucrative contracts with offworld corporations and factories specializing in weapons, armor, and ship parts. Most of Akiton&rsquo;s lesser settlements, by contrast, are company towns, squalid slums, or frontier homesteader outposts where life is cheap, harsh, and short.<br /><br />Members of nearly all of the Pact Worlds&rsquo; common races can be found somewhere on Akiton&mdash;including a seemingly native crimson-skinned @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} ethnicity&mdash;yet the best known indigenous residents are the </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}</span>.

From here, the Pact Council and its legion of delegates from all recognized Pact Worlds control the fragile alliance keeping harmony in the system, while also regulating property claims on newly discovered worlds. Here as well are the headquarters of the interplanetary law-enforcement officers called Stewards, AbadarCorp&rsquo;s home offices (at least on the Material Plane), the Archives of the galaxy-exploring Starfinders, and more. Yet the most important feature of the space station is not its grand and mysterious architecture, nor its myriad residents, but the strange artifact locked deep within the station&rsquo;s heavily guarded core: the fabled <em>Starstone</em>. For reasons unknown even to priests of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}, the <em>Starstone</em> not only powers the station but acts as an immensely powerful hyperspace beacon, allowing ships to jump quickly to the space around it no matter the distance and making Absalom Station a natural relay point for voyages returning from beyond the solar system.<br /><br />No one knows who built the vast space platform or when it entered Golarion&rsquo;s orbit, though the name hearkens back to that world&rsquo;s pre-Gap history. Artificial gravity creates a consistent &ldquo;down&rdquo; in most of the station&rsquo;s radial arms and soaring towers, and aside from individual neighborhoods retrofitted to accommodate the environmental needs of resident aliens, most of the station seems designed to cater to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} comfort. Otherwise, neighboring districts often have shockingly different cultures and living conditions, from Sparks&rsquo; hardscrabble engineering bays and the flooded tank-warrens of Puddles to the rowdy spacer bars of Drifter&rsquo;s End and the elegant, self-contained corporate enclaves in Bluerise Tower. As a general rule, money and power flow inward from the numerous bustling docks toward the great parklike dome known as the Eye, while the downtrodden masses sink down into the machine-cramped access warrens of the Spike. Gangs rule lower-class neighborhoods such as Botscrap, Downlow, and Pipetown, yet their tentative alliances filter all the way into the upper reaches of government via the station&rsquo;s Syndicsguild, the legislative body that gives each neighborhood a voice in station policy and elects the station&rsquo;s ruling Prime Executive (or Primex).<br /><br />In addition to the platform itself, Absalom Station is surrounded by a constantly changing swarm of undocked ships, both transient and resident. These latter are somewhat mockingly called the Armada, yet most are not military&mdash;the station has only a modest security fleet, depending instead on the Stewards and robust station-mounted defenses for its safety. Rather, the Armada is comprised of those starships whose owners seek the benefits of living near Absalom Station while remaining unbound by all but the most basic station laws. Absalom Station&rsquo;s generally permissive government allows this, since the volume of trade pouring through its corridors means even the lowest taxes suffice to keep the station flush.<br /><br />This is not to say the station runs in perfect harmony. With so many different interests on and around the platform, Absalom Station is never more than one slip away from chaos. Private security contractors wage shadow wars with street gangs and militant cults, alien ambassadors negotiate tense trade agreements, and explorers blast each other over claims on newly discovered worlds. One of the most dangerous factions to emerge of late is the Strong Absalom movement. This group believes the Starstone belongs only to the refugee races of Golarion, in compensation for their lost world, and that other races should be either taxed exorbitantly or outright forbidden from using the station as a waypoint. While the political arm of this movement officially decries the xenophobic terrorism of its fringe elements, its increasing strength poses a grave threat to a government built upon interplanetary cooperation.<br /><br />While trade, politics, and a cosmopolitan atmosphere are major draws to Absalom Station, they&rsquo;re not the only ones. The Arcanamirium trains some of the best technomancers in the solar system, while the station&rsquo;s famed Cosmonastery teaches the solarian&rsquo;s path. Religious organizations seek converts, the Eyeswide Agency hires out psychic investigators, the Starfinder Society launches expeditions into the unknown, and more. This endless bustle marks Absalom Station as a land of opportunity&mdash;a chance for people of all sorts to make a fresh start.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Absalom Station</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.K9j2qI3vSHyBDTaw]{Nuar Enforcer}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.VAP4WgYWhIVjrZ95]{Nuar Specialist}</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/absalom_station.webp"}

Sprawling buildings of cells, with varying sizes and amenities depending on inmates&rsquo; crimes, blanket one of the planet&rsquo;s two continents, and the worst offenders inhabit a high-security complex at its center. The planet&rsquo;s other landmass boasts lush forests and bountiful prairies. Here, low-risk prisoners are allowed to roam freely. At the luxurious continent&rsquo;s center, near a broad river, is the Mountain. This imposing structure covering hundreds of acres is the administrative hub of the place.<br /><br />The real power behind the prison-planet, however, is the Daegox Corporation, run by a mysterious humanoid race that has so far refused to reveal its home world. The corporation&rsquo;s leaders orbit the planet in a ship called Skywatcher, and they accept prisoners from any government they judge legitimate&mdash;for a fee, of course. Some speculate that the corporation is the entirety of the aliens&rsquo; race and that the planet itself is their home world, but this remains uncorroborated.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s not only cells and the lack of advanced transport that hold prisoners captive on Daegox 4. An invisible bubble surrounds the entire planet like a one-way membrane. The only reliable method for leaving the planet lies deep within the Mountain, where a magitech gate opens onto one of a dozen linked worlds. The Daegox staff who control the Mountain claim no prisoner has ever escaped, but legends abound about one known as the Wren who is said to have recently found a way.<br /><br />The planet is mostly self-sufficient, and the Daegox Corporation receives most of its money via prisoner admission fees. Yet a certain amount of the company&rsquo;s funds come from prisoners bartering with their captors, offering refined planetary resources&mdash;and, some whisper, expert assassins and suicide soldiers&mdash;in exchange for items and information from outside.<br /><br />Fortunately for the Daegox guards, the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere carries a high concentration of a spore&mdash; possibly developed by the corporation&mdash;that produces a calming effect, making non-Daegox creatures docile and agreeable. As far as the corporation reports, largescale confrontations and prisoner rebellions are practically unheard of.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

When the species of the Pact Worlds first ventured into space, Eloritu&rsquo;s worship was already well-established, with early explorers encountering his faith simultaneously in several different unconnected cultures. Eloritu&rsquo;s church teaches that he hails from a place called Gemmenad, but whether that is a planet, a star system, or some extraplanar realm in the Great Beyond is unknown. Some believe that since the Gap and the fate of Golarion rank among the greatest secrets of the universe, Eloritu must have had something to do with both, but if so, that is just one more secret that the god keeps carefully hidden.<br /><br />Eloritu teaches that while science and technology can do wondrous things, they are constrained by the laws of physics. Only magic can supersede those restraints, and those who employ magic to bend and exploit the natural laws of the universe possess a power that others can only dream of. This does not mean that Eloritu is opposed to technology. On the contrary, both magic and technology are tools that mortal races can use to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But while technology is generally designed to be as intuitive and user friendly as possible, magical practices are often deliberately obscure, requiring dedication, training, and a mastery of secrets that have been passed down for untold generations. Eloritu believes that history is both the story of the past and a guide to the future, and he teaches that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, many @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics} and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} worship Eloritu as the god of magic, along with historians, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.pHkB3pmyCsl3GOyp]{Xenoarchaeologists} who seek an understanding of the past. Many of Eloritu&rsquo;s priests and followers are Starfinders, as their work always holds the promise of uncovering new secrets. Eloritu&rsquo;s temples host academies of magical learning and research, but they are often concealed or veiled in some way, requiring those who want to study the ways of the Hidden Truth to work to discover the knowledge they seek.<br /><br />One of Eloritu&rsquo;s most obvious mysteries is that of his holy symbol: a ring of six strange magical runes. While the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} had utilized one of the runes for millennia in their magic, it wasn&rsquo;t until the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} arrived with knowledge of one of the others that it became clear that some greater game was afoot. Today, the Pact Worlds have managed to identify four of Eloritu&rsquo;s six sacred runes, all related to magical traditions of different races. What strange cultures might understand the remaining two&mdash;or what secrets combining all six might reveal&mdash;remains anyone&rsquo;s guess.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/eloritu.webp"}

The Foergrim system has no full planets, only several clouds of planetoids and asteroid belts that form rings and vague orbital clouds around the star. Stopgap is the largest object in the system&mdash;it&rsquo;s just barely big enough to round itself out through gravitational forces. It has no atmosphere or native life of its own, but it does contain the manufactured corridors and chambers of a small base.<br />The Foergrim system has just enough nearby Drift beacons to qualify as being in Near Space, although it is much farther from the Pact Worlds than most Near Space locations. However, the asteroids and planetoids fill the system have attracted the attention of mining companies. Every few years, a miner working the Foergrim system will discover a vein of starmetal in an asteroid, and the subsequent &ldquo;asteroid rush&rdquo; brings in hundreds of independent prospectors. An asteroid rush typically lasts only 3 to 6 months, but the prospectors lured in by the initial rush often discover several smaller metal veins, resulting in a semipermanent population in the system that mines out these less lucrative deposits over time.<br />Stopgap was the first location within the system in which miners discovered significant starmetal deposits, which resulted in long-term occupation by miners from across the galaxy. Stopgap became an well-known exporter of djezet, as well as tiny amounts of horacalcum. To support the starmetal harvest, mining companies collaborated to construct airtight facilities within the planet that could support a few thousand residents. Now, even though the starmetal veins in Stopgap have been mined out, the base there still supports a few hundred permanent residents, with the population growing temporarily when an asteroid rush attracts visitors to the system.<br />There is no official law in Stopgap, though the church of Abadar established a chapel to promote the idea of creating a system-wide government. The base is now almost entirely owned by the Druethil Mining Company, which is itself owned by Ichihara Holdings, though the parent company mostly leaves Stopgap to its own devices. Because of this anarchic situation, Stopgap almost always hosts a few mercenary groups on Druethil&rsquo;s payroll, often trading room, board, and starship repairs for short-term contracts. Everyone is welcome at Stopgap as long as they don&rsquo;t cause trouble and pay their bills.<br />The combination of a no-questions-asked policy, low levels of law enforcement, and millions of planetoids that can host crude bases of operations makes the Foergrim system a popular waypoint for pirates, scoundrels, mercenaries, smugglers, and various criminals. The system is extremely difficult to scan, and asteroid prospectors often report flickering sensor readings and even claim to see gray flying saucers in the denser parts of its many asteroid belts. The system&rsquo;s relative security and obscurity also make it a popular location for clandestine labs and secret vaults, which are considered far more likely to be the source of unidentified ships.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Of the many sentient races to make their home on the fertile world, the most prominent are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashunta (Damaya)}, followed closely by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.pOnYi1vHP3bWMoWd]{Formian}, all three civilizations highly connected and cosmopolitan thanks to a network of ancient magical teleportation portals called <em>aiudara</em>.<br /><br />Traditionally, Castrovel&rsquo;s lashuntas have organized into independent city-states with a variety of governmental styles, elected matriarchies being the most common. In the modern era, however, local governance of smaller cities often takes a back seat to larger corporate concerns, with regional or interplanetary companies buying out officials or setting up their own independent, privatized settlements. While these economic ties mean lashunta nationalism rarely leads to outright warfare anymore, rampant industrial espionage and corporate influence over public policy present growing concerns for residents.<br /><br />Of the city-states still capable of going toe-to-toe with corporate power, the most significant is Qabarat, the Shining Jewel of the Western Sea and the planet&rsquo;s largest spaceport. From the city&rsquo;s Threefold House, Lady Morana Kesh and her chief consort, Grantaeus, pull a delicate web of strings to keep the planet from becoming a corporate free-for-all. Also notable for their power and influence are the city&rsquo;s many universities, renowned for their vast pre-Gap archives; they train some of the best explorers, researchers, and starship navigators in the system. Architecturally, the city is a work of art, its ancient walls of crushed and glittering shells blending seamlessly with modern additions. This sense of timelessness&mdash;of connection with the planet&rsquo;s long history&mdash;is a matter of pride to many of the residents, who exult in the sounds of soldiers training in the Battle Yards, scholars arguing good-naturedly on university steps, or the roar and hiss of the landing starships that have largely replaced water-going vessels in Ship&rsquo;s End. While most visitors to the planet enter through Qabarat&rsquo;s port, numerous portals throughout the city connect it closely with other powerful lashunta settlements, such as isolated Laubu Mesa, Komena in the Floating Shards, Jabask the Unbroken, or Candares, with its endless waterfalls and dangerous cliffside corpsicum excavations.<br /><br />Though the insectile @Compendium[sfrpg.races.pOnYi1vHP3bWMoWd]{Formians} battled with @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} for millennia, the coming of the Pact and careful shirren-brokered peace talks finally ended hostilities a mere 30 years ago. Today, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.pOnYi1vHP3bWMoWd]{Formian} hives known as the Colonies work together to farm the land and trade with other races, with each individual hive queen paying tribute to the Overqueen&mdash;a purely philosophical entity established during the historic Meeting of Queens. Each of the largest formian hive-burrows can cover miles, sometimes bulging up in artificial honeycombed hills, making them confusing to visit (and historically impossible to conquer).<br /><br />At odds with this new era of peace, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves} of Sovyrian are predominantly xenophobic traditionalists, trading with outsiders only when necessary. Members of other races are rarely allowed to settle permanently on the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elven} continent and are largely barred from even entering El, Sovyrian&rsquo;s canal-choked capital city led by neighborhood-sized Great Houses. This border control is regularly violated by the city&rsquo;s own ruling elite, however, as they hire foreigners for secretive or specialized tasks.<br /><br />The abundance of seemingly untouched wilderness on Castrovel often confuses newcomers used to cutting-edge lashunta technology, yet to most of the world&rsquo;s residents, these vast ecological preserves are proof of their enlightened society. To them, maintaining wilderness is key to advancing knowledge and allowing the same evolution that brought them sentience to continue uplifting others, and the planet&rsquo;s abundant natural resources must be harvested sustainably for the good of all. Toward this end, both the planet&rsquo;s primary shipyards and its most destructive heavy industries are relegated to Elindrae, the planet&rsquo;s airless, rocky moon. Of course, various species of dangerous megafauna&mdash;from bug-eyed mountain eels to poison-beaked sky fishers&mdash;still regularly attack settlements on Castrovel, which leads to occasionally &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; burning of protected natural regions in rural areas, but a strong Xenowarden presence usually keeps such activities from getting out of hand.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Castrovel</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.SGKDx0BEDsH4Kwoa]{Nyssholora, Adult}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.CQdmqDQU3pneJwru]{Feral Shotalashu}, Formian Myrmarch, Formian Queen, Formian Taskmaster, Formian Warrior, Formian Worker, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qwK8gQXTEKP3WpZ5]{Nyssholora, Juvenile}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.sMH15qwopmk3Jeiz]{Kaukariki}, Mountain Eel, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.FNcgeQQwTzapzs87]{Shotalashu}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.GNuUufi0H5BsSvZl]{Sky Fisher},@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.zXlsCO4XtuxZoLh5]{Tashtari}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.l0QXshtjvObnBCML]{Tashtari Alpha}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qZdSijPk8K4bygyE]{Vracinea}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.7eHS7pgQUZieR9Lo]{Renkroda, Whiskered}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.Fe0IcQBtHNvpsCvx]{Yaruk}</p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/castrovel.webp"}

When it reached its destination of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and found the world too populated&mdash;and too well defended&mdash;for outright colonization, the ship took up orbit just past @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and declared itself a Pact World in its own right. Unlike Absalom Station, however, the <em>Idari </em>has not become a melting pot and remains inhabited primarily by kasathas and governed according to traditional kasathan values.<br /><br />While the <em>Idari </em>retains its massive reaction drives, these engines haven&rsquo;t fired in decades, and their power has been rerouted to aid the Crucibles, the ship&rsquo;s impressive state-run manufacturing sector. The ship&rsquo;s prevalent artificial gravity comes from the vast rotating cylinder referred to as the Drum, which makes up most of the ship&rsquo;s body. This curving landscape is home to gleaming cities, rolling parks, and glass-walled hydroponic farm-towers. Daylight is constant inside the ship&rsquo;s corridors, rerouted from solar collectors on the hull&rsquo;s sunward faces, though individuals often observe a 27-hour day broken into nine-hour work shifts. Through the center of the Drum runs the Hub, a zero-gravity transport tube with elevator spurs running down to the &ldquo;ground,&rdquo; allowing travelers to quickly access any location in the Drum, as well as the bridge, combat stations, engineering, and other areas.<br /><br />Government on the ship is handled by the traditional @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathan} Doyenate, a representative council composed of the most respected members of a variety of fields and callings. While the doyens and their close relatives act as a sort of aristocracy among kasathas, and these families tend to be known for accomplishments in certain fields, status as a doyen is never inherited but instead recognized by the people&mdash;sometimes against the prospective doyen&rsquo;s will. (The doyen of exploration, for instance, rarely appreciates being dragged back home to a desk job.) All doyens have a say in government decisions, yet their status both within the council and in general society is determined by their role&rsquo;s importance&mdash;a fact that has resulted in trouble in recent decades as roles like captain, so important during the <em>Idari&rsquo;s </em>flight, gradually lose significance.<br /><br />Idaran citizens are independent and may travel or emigrate without restriction, yet keeping the ship running requires a significant crew, and many of those who live on the <em>Idari </em>work for the government in some capacity. Idarans residing on the ship for more than a year and desiring the right to participate in the ship&rsquo;s government must accept and train for an auxiliary crew role. These roles are generally considered a formality, to be used only in the event of extreme emergency, and plenty of Idarans have professions totally unrelated to their reservist rank and training. Both professional crew members and ordinary civilians live side by side in the city-like Sectors spread throughout the Drum&mdash;dense but artistically arranged settlements designed around different themes. Travelers riding along the Hub can easily see the differences between sectors, as they pass from river-cut Almolar to temple-choked Brispex with its sharp and shimmering gables, from urban Khovi to the vat-farms of Mesacand, and so forth.<br /><br />One of the most recognizable features within the Drum is the Sholar Adat, a cathedral-like spire in Brispex stretching nearly to the Hub, which acts as a combination cemetery, library, and ancestor temple. While many kasathas use the structure to record and archive their memoirs or pay tribute to lost loved ones, the temple&rsquo;s claim to fame is the process called adat.<br /><br />When a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} dies aboard the <em>Idari</em>, the body is fed into the ship&rsquo;s recyclers to be broken down into useful components. Before this happens, however, the corpse is taken to the Sholar Adat, where robed attendants&mdash;adata&mdash;harvest a hairthin slice of the deceased&rsquo;s brain, which is then preserved and added to the temple&rsquo;s archives. Through the building&rsquo;s complex technomagical machinery, these samples can be used to kindle brief flashes of the deceased&rsquo;s memory and sometimes even to contact the departed soul with questions. While querying a soul isn&rsquo;t cheap and accessing a soul that passed less than a hundred years ago requires a warrant, many adata spend their time in stasis beds patched into the ship&rsquo;s Sensorium, untangling the blizzard of ancient memories with the goal of advancing kasathan society through ancestral wisdom.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/pact_worlds/idari.webp"}

Travel between worlds in the system appears to have been regular but expensive, whether via ultra-powerful spells, the slow trudge of reaction drives, or plane-shifting engines like the infamous Kuthite shadow drives. Even so, the incredible distances between stars made attempts at travel beyond the solar system&rsquo;s edge exceptionally rare, the stuff of fools and zealots.<br /><br />Upon ascending to godhood, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}&rsquo;s first action was to send out the Signal: a miraculous, galaxy-wide broadcast containing plans for a new type of starship engine, one capable of accessing a heretofore unknown plane of reality called the Drift. No one truly knows whether @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} discovered the Drift by peering into the metaphysical code underlying reality, as it claims, or created the plane by divine fiat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Drift Physics</h1>\n<p>Despite its strange appearance, the Drift isn&rsquo;t very different from Material Plane space. The plane is mostly empty, airless, and sports no appreciable gravitational pull. The exception to this is what Drift explorers call &ldquo;planar bubbles.&rdquo; When a piece of another plane is torn away and added to the Drift, part of its essence expands the Drift&rsquo;s planar fabric, yet the rest is added whole cloth, its terrain (and any creatures or items present at the moment of theft) set floating in the Drift&rsquo;s expanse. The largest of these annexations are able to maintain localized regions in which their former planar properties remain dominant. As soon as anything is removed from these bubbles, it immediately loses these former planar qualities. Some scholars believe that over time these bubbles slowly break down, &ldquo;digested&rdquo; by the Drift, but if so, it&rsquo;s an inexplicably random process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Drift Travel</h1>\n<p>Drift travel operates via the same general principles as other forms of plane shifting, but without magic. Because distances within the Drift don&rsquo;t correspond to those on the Material Plane, it&rsquo;s possible for a ship to enter the Drift at one point, travel a short distance, and then pop back out onto the Material Plane in a vastly distant location, circumventing the space in between. In this way, ships can travel between star systems thousands of light years apart in a matter of days or weeks.<br /><br />While this has proven an enormous boon for the cultures of the Pact Worlds, and indeed civilizations across the galaxy, it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as it sounds. Navigating in the Drift is tricky for several reasons. First, the Drift has no real landmarks&mdash;while it&rsquo;s full of chunks of strange terrain and random objects pulled in from other planes, the Drift itself is a gargantuan, empty void of warping pink-and-purple light patterns and shifting matterless clouds of mysterious energy. Second, the Drift&rsquo;s growth is distributed randomly, with the distances between two points within the Drift constantly shifting as the plane expands or shrinks in particular regions. As a result, nothing stays in the same place for long, and two seemingly still objects may suddenly be thousands of perceived miles apart.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s where Drift beacons enter the picture. Created and maintained by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune's} church, Drift beacons somehow manage to exist simultaneously on both the Material Plane and in the Drift. As a result, navigators can use the beacons&rsquo; positions and advanced mathematics to locate the correct spot to exit the Drift. This doesn&rsquo;t mean exiting precisely at a given beacon&rsquo;s location&mdash; in fact, many beacons are found adrift in space far from any desirable destination. Instead, the most important factor of Drift navigation is the density of beacons in a given region of real space, and it&rsquo;s this factor that most affects the length of time required to travel between locations, as well as whether a given destination is considered to be in Near Space or the Vast. To date, the Drift has never been used to travel beyond the galactic rim, though it&rsquo;s unclear whether this is a limit of Drift beacon technology, the plane itself, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune's} influence, or something else entirely.<br /><br />Trying to locate a particular point within the Drift, such as a specific planar bubble, is exceptionally difficult, requiring at least a successful DC 30 Piloting check to navigate (and possibly much more, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Certain magic items, divine fiat, or mysterious &ldquo;beacon codes&rdquo; provided by the Church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} allow a ship to revisit a location. This is particularly true of Alluvion, the strange amalgam city that @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} has publicly claimed as its divine realm. While ships regularly end up in the city by accident in the course of executing other jumps, reaching the city on purpose requires the aforementioned divine coordinate codes.<br /><br />Using the Drift to travel between places on the Material Plane still requires a certain amount of time spent traveling through the Drift, though this journey can take wildly varying amounts of time, even for the same ship. Similarly, these paths aren&rsquo;t as precise as physical trade routes. As such, two ships heading from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} to Vesk Prime might leave from near the same point and have the same transit time, yet never encounter each other in the Drift. This slight variation means that two ships can&rsquo;t exit the Drift onto exactly the same point in Material Plane space, and a ship won&rsquo;t exit directly into a solid object. On the other hand, it is also impossible for anyone to fortify and thus control specific jump points within the Drift, and those attempting to guard their planet from invasion would need to mine every inch of space around their world.<br /><br />All of this is useful for individual ships but adds complications for fleets or caravans attempting to arrive at the same time, let alone in the same formation. In these situations, multiple vessels can &ldquo;slave&rdquo; their Drift engines to one another, effectively becoming a single entity for purposes of travel time and arrival position. The downside to this &ldquo;mass Drifting&rdquo; is that it forces all of the component ships to use the lowest Drift engine rating of the group. Only a few militaries have developed specific master control vessels capable of circumventing this restriction and moving entire armadas quickly and coherently.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Planar Traits</h1>\n<p>Like every plane, the Drift has certain properties that remain consistent and distinguish it from other planes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Transitive Plane</h2>\n<p>The Drift is considered a transitive plane, meaning that mortals primarily use it for transportation. It is technically coterminous with the Material Plane, meaning that a given point on one corresponds to a point on another, yet these points are hopelessly scrambled&mdash;two points apparently a mile apart in the Drift might correspond to locations thousands of light-years apart on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">No Gravity</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">While individual planar bubbles may have their own regions of localized gravitational pull, for the most part the Drift itself has no distinguishable gravity. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Normal Time</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Time within the Drift passes at the same rate as time on the Material Plane. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Infinite And Expanding</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Although the Drift is technically finite&mdash;in much the same way as Outer Planes like the mountain of Heaven or Hell&rsquo;s many-layered pit&mdash;it&rsquo;s so vast as to be effectively infinite, and no one has ever found an edge or border of the plane. At the same time, divine investigation has shown that the Drift is still growing as it absorbs tiny pieces of other planes. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Dynamic Morphology</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">The Drift is fundamentally consistent, and objects within it follow the normal rules of Material Plane physics. Due to the plane&rsquo;s constant and random growth, objects&rsquo; positions in space are unstable: two objects floating next to each other one moment might suddenly be thousands of miles apart the next, without apparent movement. Fortunately, this random shifting rarely affects people or equipment while traveling through the Drift. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Mildly Neutral-Aligned</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Creatures of any alignment can exist within the Drift without taking any penalties. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Limited Magic</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Most magic functions normally in the Drift, except for spells or magical abilities that transport creatures or material in or out of the Drift. Thus spells or abilities such as <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.o78PjAYBWQpiHwMK]{Shadow Walk}</em> and <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.yjClpQv6CCrRE4EC]{Plane Shift}</em> simply fail to work, as do summoning spells and abilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found In The Drift</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.eIZGneIcEva2KBH6]{Aspecna}, Blinking Telelith (Starship), Drift Architech, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.N44K5spqrIUIlaAi]{Drift Leech}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.I0MAZmgTQ22jetq3]{Drift Mote}, Driftdead, Driftdead Amalgam, Driftlure, Garaggakal, Garaggakal Polymath, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.aV6DayWBbnnQOZyU]{Iridia}, Nacrea, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.5Uezw0obpI1MK8SC]{Paraforan}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.q6bXlwwgl9QPsTox]{Paraforan Fragment}, Swarming Telelith (Starship), Time Eater.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

With Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, Iomedae&rsquo;s connection to that world took on even greater significance, and she became the Spirit of Golarion, the patron goddess of humanity. Iomedae is a righteous knight, fearless in battle, and a missionary and crusader on behalf of the benign sovereignty of good. She personifies glory, honor, justice, strength, and valor, and is unafraid to point her sword at the greatest evils facing humanity and the Pact Worlds.<br /><br />Iomedae is both fiercely martial and wisely benevolent, and she commands the respect of any deity who deals with her. She expects her mortal servants to exercise courtesy and receive the same in their dealings with one another. She strongly desires justice for everyone, honorable behavior from each individual, and bravery in battle, no matter the odds. Iomedae teaches that it is better to convince evildoers to lay down their arms in honorable surrender than cut them down, but she sanctions her followers to wage unyielding war against those who persist in serving evil.<br /><br />As the patron goddess of humanity, the Spirit of Golarion counts humans as the majority of her worshipers, but many vesk and kasathas are attracted to her code of honorable battle. A typical follower of Iomedae is a right-minded, hardworking person, helpful toward others and ready to accept help when it is offered. Crusaders, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.fqYiP2f9oSfcmrwC]{Envoys}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers} all worship Iomedae, and many carry versions of the goddess&rsquo;s favored weapon, the @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.q0CQbPuIbLWlcVjU]{Longsword}, with them into battle. Her priests fight against oppression and seek to reshape the universe into a better form, by the sword if need be. Iomedae&rsquo;s church sponsors several knightly orders, most notably the Knights of Golarion (see page 478), who patrol the Pact Worlds and more distant star systems where humanity has settled, tirelessly crusading against evil in their mighty cathedralships.<br /><br />Where her followers establish outposts of her faith on other planets, moons, and larger asteroids, they construct large temples in which they can praise her name. These buildings are often fabricated in the style of old Golarion churches, with large fountains, soaring arches, and walls made to look like whitewashed stone. Despite their appearance, though, these structures don&rsquo;t lack modern technological amenities, as crusading knights will sometimes request to use them as training grounds, recuperation facilities, and temporary living spaces.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/iomedae.webp"}

To them, war and conquest are woven into the fabric of the universe, from plants&rsquo; and animals&rsquo; most basic conflicts to vast wars of ideology. One can choose to embrace this truth and secure a place in history with one&rsquo;s triumphs, or one can deny it and die a coward&rsquo;s death, scorned and forgotten. War requires sacrifice, however, and it is the duty of everyone in society to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to propel one&rsquo;s species&mdash;or culture, empire, kingdom, or world&mdash;to victory.<br /><br />Damoritosh is a harsh deity, with no concern for freedom or comfort. Sometimes called the Grim Commander, he demands soldier-like obedience from all who seek his blessing and pushes his followers to seek victory at all costs. Courage is an admirable trait, as is a militaristic sense of honor and oath keeping, but the will to fight and the drive to win are far more important to his adherents than such noble ideals as bravery or heroism. In their minds, the strong will always subjugate the weak, and so the best strategy is to project strength and defeat potential enemies before they can become a threat. Damoritosh is uninterested in diplomacy, as force and military prowess can win far greater rewards in a shorter amount of time, but he also encourages the acceptance of a foe&rsquo;s honorable surrender to avoid wasting lives for no additional gain.<br /><br />Damoritosh is the primary patron god of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, but the Conqueror&rsquo;s faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.in3kIU1U7JjTuCJ4]{Mercenaries}, soldiers, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers} of all species, especially the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} and the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashunta}. Many of Damoritosh&rsquo;s priests serve as mercenary commanders, military advisors, or chaplains in planetary defense forces, but others seek to live Damoritosh&rsquo;s teachings as fully as possible, conquering minor dominions for themselves as petty warlords both within the Pact Worlds and on new worlds throughout the galaxy. Often built in traditional vesk architectural styles, Damoritosh&rsquo;s temples are large bunker-like structures that can be easily fortified and defended by just a few warriors. Stockpiled with weapons and supplies, most churches can withstand a protracted siege or serve as a secure base for military operations, if necessary.<br /><br />While many other races see Damoritosh as destructive, his congregations believe that conquest is a wave moving ever onward, and there&rsquo;s no point in going back and mistreating those you&rsquo;ve already bested, provided they remain deferential. His sacred weapon, the energy-bladed @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.zd4YQsotsf3iKdys]{Doshko}, remains strongly associated with both his church and vesk warriors in general.</span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/damoritosh.webp"}

These telltale clues lead to general acceptance of the theory that the planetoid originated somewhere beyond the system and was caught in the sun&rsquo;s orbit thousands of years before the Gap. Whether the world was guided to the system intentionally or arrived through some accident remains anyone&rsquo;s guess.<br /><br />The few existing records of visits to the planetoid in the centuries prior to the Gap describe a barren, airless surface and a warren of atmosphere-filled caverns and tunnels riddling the rock through to its core. Many of the chambers were empty, but others held ancient machines that still hummed, indestructible doors, permanently comatose and preserved creatures with a range of alien forms, and vaults of advanced technology and weapons. Though a few research teams explored Apostae before the Gap, interacting with a now-extinct race known as the ilee that dwelled inside the tunnels, no group from outside the world ever established a permanent foothold on the planetoid, which most assumed to be some sort of ancient generation ship or otherwise self-contained environment. Strangely, nothing in the records suggest that the ilee themselves had any knowledge of their origin, giving rise to the theory that they may have degenerated over millennia between the stars or else been some sort of captured or servitor race that outlived their masters.<br /><br />No one knows exactly what happened to completely kill off the ilee, but since the end of the Gap, Apostae has been primarily in the hands of several powerful houses of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow}&mdash;purple-skinned elves who reject their kindred on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and worship powerful demons. How and when the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} first came to the world is also a mystery lost to the Gap, but most believe that they fled there shortly before Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, guided by their demonic patrons in a twisted parody of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves'} own escape. Today, despite centuries of effort to expand their holdings and increase their meager population, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} still maintain only incomplete control of the planet-ship&rsquo;s interior, and their influence on the barren surface is mostly restricted to a single major city near one of the massive doors leading down into the rock. Even this much, however&mdash;when combined with their significant economic power&mdash;has been sufficient for them to claim Apostae as their home world and become signatories to the Pact, over the loud objections of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves}.<br /><br />Much like the bone sages of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} houses don&rsquo;t work together as a cohesive government and assemble only to elect ambassadors as required by the Pact. Each @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} house acts independently, with most operating family-run corporations that deal primarily in arms, especially new technologies discovered or retroengineered from the alien items recovered by archaeo-salvage teams within Apostae. The orcs, half-orcs, and other races that live in the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow}-controlled settlements are at best second-class citizens, with no say in political matters, mostly used as laborers or subterranean cannon fodder when teams break into previously sealed chambers in search of the fabled Armory or Chamber of Life.<br /><br />The most powerful house on Apostae is House Zeizerer, which also has the broadest and most successful network for weapon sales. House Zeizerer controls Nightarch, the largest city on the planetoid&rsquo;s surface and the only known point of entry to Apostae&rsquo;s interior, as all of the other huge doors set into the planet&rsquo;s surface are locked and have proven indestructible. As a major spaceport, the city hosts bustling markets dealing in personal and starship weaponry, mercenary squads of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} warriors, fleshwarping augmentations, and custom weapons designs.<br /><br />In addition to searching for alien technology within the planet&rsquo;s vaults&mdash;either on official contract or by slipping past @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} defenses&mdash;visitors often come to Nightarch to study the eponymous arch at the center of the city. This arch is similar to those that link many of the system&rsquo;s worlds&mdash;and a functioning ring of such portals within the city provides access to most of the other Pact Worlds&mdash;yet this particular arch is covered in markings that have so far defied all efforts at analysis. When it activates, spontaneously and at rare and random intervals, it creates a gate to unknown landscapes.

Although evidence existed of a sapient species, it seems these people had long vanished. Within months, a bustling colony had been established on the verdant world. Most settlers left the crumbling, many-pillared stone ruins they discovered largely undisturbed. A few brave souls, however, delved into their depths to return with tales of eerie statue gardens, piles of crushed stone and dust, and bizarre stone machines. But before further explorations could be conducted, Dina III&rsquo;s abundance proved irresistible to the Swarm, which fell upon the world without warning.<br /><br />With few options, the desperate colonists fled into the ruins, ravenous Swarm components close behind. The ruins, however, were not as dead as they appeared. Ancient, quasi-magical machines sprang to life, spurred into action by the presence of hostile life. Acting on the same corrupted programming that destroyed their extinct creators, the machines released a countermeasure: calcifying nanites that spread a wave of petrification across the planet. Within hours, the vibrant world&rsquo;s life, including colonists and Swarm components alike, was nothing more than cold stone. Left with little more than worthless stone, the Swarm departed, reclaiming only some of its transformed components.<br /><br />Yet this was not the end. The magic that spread the petrifying plague faded in some cases, especially in simpler life-forms, leaving only all technology turned to stone. Some of the settlers awoke to find the Swarm mostly gone. Remaining Swarm, most of them vicious soldier components deployed in the first attack waves, awakened to find that something about the affliction had not only destroyed all aspects of their biotechnology, but also rendered many of them unable to rejoin in a hive mind. Most of the Swarm components on Dina III are now little more than vicious monsters that attack anything else they find.<br /><br />Possessing no way to communicate with galactic civilization or leave the planet, the settlers could only construct crude warnings for would-be visitors and carve out a simpler life for themselves. Diminished but still extant nanites, which the colonists named &ldquo;Medusa nanites,&rdquo; can petrify new arrivals, but previously affected life is now immune. In the years since this calamity, the settlers of Dina III have persisted. Swarm components still stalk across the landscape, forcing the colonists to stay on the move. While some have fallen to despair or the Swarm, many still dare to hope.<br /><br />Dina III has numerous sites of interest, such as the following.<br /><br /><strong>Oceanside Palace:</strong> This palatial villa stands both above and below the shoreline of Dina III&rsquo;s northern ocean, its lower chambers flooded. The nomadic colonists periodically seek refuge within the palace, residing until Swarm components or other beasts drive them out again. The palace&rsquo;s carvings depict a great city in caverns underneath the seafloor, but the colonists have not yet discovered a route to reach these caverns.<br /><br /><strong>Dina Alpha:</strong> The former Pact Worlds colony Dina Alpha is a stony husk of what it once was. With everything from plastic to nanocarbon transmuted to stone, the technology here is nonfunctional and every structure bears scars of the Swarm&rsquo;s attack. Those descending upon the ruins from space can see a crude message spelled out in piles of stone: &ldquo;Turn Back Now!&rdquo;<br /><br />Around Dina Alpha are the remains of two missions to the colony world. These investigators came to determine why Dina III lost contact with the wider galaxy. The first expedition was a total loss, although some of its members remain stranded here after recovering from Medusa nanites. However, members of the second team made it away from the planet with reports of the nanite infection and unusual Swarm components. A third mission to Dina III might seek to discover what happened or recover the remains of someone lost in the earlier missions.<br /><br /><strong>Shapeless City:</strong> A grand ruin easily visible from Dina Alpha, the Shapeless City&rsquo;s vast colonnades and inverted rooftops tower above the treetops surrounding it, some of which are still stone themselves. Over three-quarters of the vast ruin lie underground, with labyrinthine corridors stretching off into subterranean darkness and tremendous chambers containing entire districts of vertically arranged buildings. The Euryalium, the vault from which Dina III&rsquo;s disaster was unleashed, is one of many such treasures within the ruins. Technology within these vaults, manufactured entirely from stone through refined nanotech techniques, is the only source of advanced weaponry or technological protection on Dina III.<br /><br />Since the calamity that befell them, the colonists have avoided the Shapeless City, which is home to the wildest and most numerous Swarm components remaining on the planet. In so doing, the survivors have yet to discover a possible source of their salvation: located within is Persid, a sapient, magical computer-construct with the power to deactivate the Medusa nanites. For it to do so, however, it must be subdued or convinced it should do so.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

However, when a project aimed at harnessing gravity to achieve the wonder of space travel went horribly awry, it created an anomaly at the planet&rsquo;s core. The planet&rsquo;s crust shattered, and much of the world&rsquo;s mass floated out into space. The majority of the population was killed, but remarkably, large chunks of land remained unharmed. The mystical gravitational forces also kept the atmosphere intact, but thin. Orry now encompasses 10 massive swaths of land, along with several dozen smaller formations that float in regular orbits around a central point; some take a full Pact Standard year to traverse a full orbit. These landmasses never collide and rotate slowly so that their bottoms always face the anomaly.<br /><br />As the centuries passed, the humanoid natives of Orry forgot their high technology and magic, surviving in their fractured ecosystem and eventually becoming a simple, relatively lowtech agrarian society. Trade exists between the handful of Orry&rsquo;s larger cities, even across the gulfs of space between islands and nations. Due to their slow orbits, they remain close enough that crossing from one to another becomes possible. Brave groups of daredevils called bridgers use death-defying acrobatic techniques to swing themselves across the gaps and fashion temporary rope-and-wood structures that allow travelers to journey from one island to another.<br /><br />Unknown to most Orrians, artifacts from their golden age still exist, some of which interfere with flight and teleportation magic and technology.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Aliens found at Orry</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.tSwusgjsfiFyfuNz]{Phentomite}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.JLrtwrcq896pW0LX]{Phentomite Bridger}</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Yaraesa is the goddess of this struggle&mdash;the constant endeavor to develop one&rsquo;s mind and reach a state of intellectual and spiritual perfection. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} attribute many of their race&rsquo;s early scientific advancements to Yaraesa, claiming that she was once a living scientist who learned everything that could be learned on the mortal plane. In mastering her own mind, she ascended to godhood to study all the wisdom and lore of the Great Beyond.<br /><br />Yaraesa&rsquo;s followers seek to emulate their goddess, hoping to eventually transcend their mortal forms. The path one takes toward this perfection is an individual choice&mdash;education, physical exercise, scientific scholarship, and spiritual meditation are all valid enterprises. The simple act of reading&mdash;whether on a computer screen, an actual printed volume, or direct eye-projection&mdash;can be an act of homage to Yaraesa, and each piece of knowledge or insight gained brings one a step closer to the goddess. Yaraesa bridges the divide between science and spirituality, teaching that the more you learn about the underlying laws of the universe, the more you understand about yourself.<br /><br />A majority of Yaraesa&rsquo;s worshipers and priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas}, but her faith is popular throughout the Pact Worlds, particularly among @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens}. Educators, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.HNCQFSPw4DVTATHv]{Mechanics}, psychics, scientists, scholars, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} venerate the Lady of Wisdom as they explore the boundaries of both mortal knowledge and their own minds. Yaraesa&rsquo;s temples resemble ancient libraries filled with books&mdash;even if the volumes on display are just holographic props&mdash;and always include small, quiet rooms where worshipers can read or meditate in peace. Many universities, especially those on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} or funded by </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas}</span>, contain chapels to Yaraesa.<br /><br />One unusual quirk of Yaraesa&rsquo;s worshipers is their vocal rejection of faith&mdash;or rather, some conventional understandings of it. Yaraesa teaches that the scientific process and knowledge gained through controlled, replicable, and verifiable experiments are the best way to understand the universe. Where some gods offer knowledge and power as a reward for allegiance, Yaraesa demands that her people figure things out for themselves as best they can. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that she refuses to grant her followers magical power; rather, she generally does so in consistent and predictable ways that can be taught like a science, and she&rsquo;s more likely to nudge someone toward a discovery than hand them the answer. For members of her church, faith isn&rsquo;t blind trust but a healthy and skeptical relationship between an esteemed teacher and her pupils.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/yaraesa.webp"}

Its creators vanished millennia ago, and much of it remains abandoned. The ruined regions near the gash are open to the vacuum. Much of the rest appears relatively intact and is home to isolated communities of researchers, scavengers, and squatters. Several, including the aatevak, qotraua, and xixinnt, claim descent from the Shroud&rsquo;s creators, but the mismatch between their biology and the structure&rsquo;s architecture makes their claims unlikely.<br /><br />The Shroud&rsquo;s life-support system functions only partially, and some areas have unbreathable atmospheres or fluctuating gravity. Its remaining defense systems periodically engage without provocation. The space around and within it is also perilous, containing massive haunts said to be the ghostly remains of the worlds destroyed to fuel the Shroud&rsquo;s creation. The structure also suffers periodic incursions from organizations seeking its secrets.<br /><br />Eerily, the Riven Shroud may be using these incursions to slowly repair itself. Bordering its edges are irregular arrays of derelict ships and stretches of newer sail. The largest and most ancient of this dead armada share the same strange architecture as the Shroud.

This cycle takes 317 Pact Standard years, with whole generations living and dying in a single season and plant and animal life forming two nearly separate ecologies, each going dormant during its off season. Of the creatures that adapt to both, the most prominent are the humanoid @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians}, who manifest thick white fur and narrowed eyes to protect against snow blindness in the winter and develop smooth, dark skin in the summer. While the advent of spaceflight has made such adaptations less important for survival, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorian} biology continues to be inexplicably tied to the planet, which is currently locked in winter. Those @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians} born offworld generally maintain their current winterborn form, though even without knowing the exact mechanism, some have begun using magic and genetic engineering to transition early.<br /><br />Much of traditional Triaxian culture revolves around the fraught relationship between humanoids and dragons. For millennia, the fractious humanoid nations of the Allied Territories battled against the dragon-ruled nations of the Drakelands. The tactically crucial isthmus between the two warring continents was the Skyfire Mandate, defended on the allied side by a legion of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians} bonded with intelligent dragonkin mounts. With the coming of the Pact, however, the primarily evil dragons of the Drakelands saw the advantages of membership and trade with the other Pact Worlds, and active hostilities ceased. Today, while humanoids remain second-class citizens in the Drakelands, their masters have opted for more subtle power plays, with many dragons acting as shadowy investors in major corporations. The Allied Nations, meanwhile, largely lost their reason for cohesion, and today nations such as militant Kamora, where every citizen goes armed, vie for relevance with countries such as Zo, where spaceflight and its support are practically a state religion, or Preita, the Scholar&rsquo;s Paradise, where @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} duel on campuses for high-paying corporate contracts. While most of the nations have prospered under the new interplanetary arrangement, a few have refused to modernize fully and still cling to the old ways. Of these, the best known is the pugnacious walled city of Aylok, which shoots down any starship that dares enter its airspace and requires that anyone seeking to trade or meet with its ruling Imperators come in by land instead, through trap-lined plains of jagged ice and hordes of furred insectile horrors bred for defense. Such policies have deeply undercut the city&rsquo;s health and economy, but so far the ruling elite claims it&rsquo;s the only way to avoid complete cultural annihilation by the encroaching Pact Worlds.<br /><br />Even with minor outliers like Aylok, nowhere did the advent of the Pact have a greater effect than in the Skyfire Mandate. With peace&mdash;if a tense one&mdash;between dragons and humanoids, and with spaceflight replacing planetary combat in importance, the territory&rsquo;s famed Dragon Legion found itself without a purpose. In response, its leaders took to the stars, and today the rebranded Skyfire Legion forms an elite and highly principled mercenary organization, selling its protection to well-meaning colonists and corporations operating beyond the solar system (and thus outside the Stewards&rsquo; protection). Now the dragonkin themselves are only occasionally ridden in atmosphere. Many starfaring dragonkin families have resorted to genetic engineering to reduce their size to better fit in the narrow corridors of space stations and starships, and thanks to their near-telepathic bond with their partners, no humanoid of the legion would dream of flying a starfighter without her dragonkin copilot.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Outside of the Allied Territories, a notable exception to prevailing Triaxian culture is the continent of Ning, long cut off from the other nations by the vast Sephorian Sea. Like backward-looking Aylok, Ning has refused to acknowledge the Pact&rsquo;s authority, but it has embraced modernization, making it a haven for corporations, criminals, and all others that seek to avoid Pact control. Far from being a lawless society, however, Ning is obsessed with honor and status&mdash;traits that attract a fair number of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} immigrants&mdash;and its upper class, led by the Immortal Suzerain, keeps its citizens safe from dangers both domestic and foreign.

The guides who steer Nerralen seem to pick worlds where technology is making a dramatic leap forward, or where a new innovation is changing lifestyle and culture.<br />Most of Nerralen&rsquo;s inhabitants dwell in its hollow interior, provided with light, heat, and power by a tiny artificial sun. Aqueduct systems redirect water from a small inner sea. Indeed, everything required to sustain life is provided by Nerralen itself, which also houses a menagerie of alien life collected from the worlds it has visited, many of which have gone extinct in their original habitat. Vast halls and a maze of smaller chambers and corridors cover the rest of the moon, filled with technology acquired from countless worlds, each used in innovative ways to create devices and capabilities found nowhere else. Powerful sensors enable the inhabitants of Nerralen to closely observe the world they are orbiting, as well as monitor other planets they&rsquo;ve visited or might return to.<br />When Nerralen arrives in orbit around a planet, the inhabitants of the target world often send exploratory vessels to learn more about the new satellite. If these explorers are deemed worthy, they are brought aboard Nerralen and offered a chance to join the cabal of technomancers, military leaders, and agents who investigate target worlds in deep cover. Many visitors accept this offer, and the population of Nerralen is now highly diverse, made up of inhabitants from all the worlds it has visited over many years. Those who refuse, or who are judged unworthy of a meeting, are returned home with their memories of Nerralen erased. A few worlds, home to regular scientific advancements and frequently visited by Nerralen, believe it to be native to the Astral or Ethereal Plane, a malevolent harbinger that captures scientists and inventors.<br />Nerralen avoids close inspection from the populations it visits by obscuring itself with high-technology screens; when anyone truly threatens it, the cabal of technomancers who guide the moon simply teleport it to a new orbit around a distant world. Nerralen rarely comes anywhere near the Pact Worlds or other highly-developed star systems, since these societies pose a reasonable threat to its way of life. A century ago, it appeared around @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}, and many scientists from Kashak joined Nerralen&rsquo;s community at that time; soon thereafter, Nerralen&rsquo;s range expanded significantly, and it was spotted orbiting planets where it had never been seen before. The guides of Nerralen have not since risked a visit to such a large, populous, and well-trafficked planet, and now the moon only visits worlds far from most Drift beacons.</span></p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Entha&rsquo;s surface appears rather mundane; its foaming seas are only occasionally interrupted by rocky outcroppings jutting up from undersea mountain ranges. The amphibious flflying creatures that nest on these rocks are a visitor&rsquo;s fifirst hint at the biodiversity that lies below. Deep underwater, thick forests of twisting seaweed strands that stretch hundreds of yards up from the ocean flfloor shelter underwater clearings replete with bioluminescent creatures of all shapes and sizes, whirling around each other in a dangerous ballet of survival. Unfathomably deep trenches conceal secrets and horrors unimagined by any explorer, and throughout Entha&rsquo;s oceans, microscopic, protomagical plankton imbue the water with a low-grade supernatural aura.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entha's most remarkable natural fixtures are extensive deep-sea structures that resemble coral reefs-the formation&nbsp;of which would be impossible on most worlds, where the pressure of the depths makes it diffifficult for such fragile yet vibrant frameworks to grow. However, Entha&rsquo;s reefs are manifestations of a world-spanning magical network that twists and winds beneath the seabed, and the reefs not only survive at great depths but are imbued with this same magic. As threads of Entha&rsquo;s magical mantle escape through its crust and touch the supernatural seawater, they harden into labyrinthine, shining, psychedelic forms, creating frozen explosions of color and texture deep beneath the waves&mdash;a process xenobiologists estimate must take millennia, though the Gap has made it diffifficult to know for sure.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 64\">\n<p>One of the reefs&rsquo; most inflfluential effffects is their localized reduction of water pressure to near-surface levels; even on the ocean flfloor, this magical depressurization enables all manner of creatures to thrive in what would otherwise be utterly crushing conditions. EJ Corp&rsquo;s terraforming efffforts on the planet involve detaching these reefs from the seabed, causing them to flfloat to the surface and provide large swaths of new &ldquo;land&rdquo; on which resort property can be built. Of course, as the Company strips this coral from the ocean floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;it severs the reefs&rsquo; tether to the planet&rsquo;s magical undercurrents. The sudden, full weight of the water above proves deadly for the myriad life-forms that inhabit the reefs.&nbsp;The fifirst Company machinery to lift coral immediately imploded due to the sudden change in water pressure, but the corporation has since built specially adapted coral crawlers to withstand the pressure change.</p>\n<p>All manner of creatures, both mundate and magical, have evolved to live on Entha, from leviathan @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.74I5mQmMMiZWJ7jf]{Abynthics} and giant jellies to hill-sized flounders hugging the sea floor and dart-like shark-rays that teleport short distances to close in on their prey. The only sapient life to exist on Entha are the eel-like creatures known as @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives. eUecRoskCBWjDIn7]{Aglians}. Individually, each @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives. eUecRoskCBWjDIn7]{Aglian} embodies only a single specific thought or concept, but when enough gather together, they link together like neurons and form an emergent consciousness. They depend heavily on the sustaining magic of the coral reefs, and the Company's terraforming efforts are rapidly jeopardizing their habitable space.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

But when the Swarm rejected individuality for the collectivity of the hive, it abandoned Hylax as well. Hylax respected the Swarm&rsquo;s choice and resolved not to interfere with its development, turning her attention to other sentient insectile species in the galaxy, but she always hoped her children would return to her. Eventually, the Forever Queen&rsquo;s patience was rewarded when the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens} broke from the Swarm&rsquo;s hive mind and became individuals once more, rediscovering their ancient patron in the process.<br /><br />Hylax knows that peace is a better state than war and that friendship is more rewarding than hostility. She teaches her followers to consistently use diplomacy in their dealings with others, to constantly strive for fellowship and harmony, and to always seek allies rather than conquest. But Hylax also realizes that sometimes diplomacy fails and that the peaceful must sometimes defend the innocent. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with failing to achieve peace&mdash;the moral imperative is simply to make the attempt, no matter how difficult or distasteful it might seem.<br /><br />The intelligent arthropods of the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavaran} moon of Nchak have worshiped Hylax since even before the Gap, believing that their leaders are the mortal incarnations of the Forever Queen and striving to build their civilization in accordance with her teachings.

Priests of Hylax often serve on starships engaged in interstellar exploration missions, acting as first contact specialists should their crews encounter new extraterrestrial species. Hylax&rsquo;s hive-like temples may be found wherever species from different worlds mingle together, and all are welcome inside in the spirit of amity and harmony.<br /><br />Though Hylax is traditionally a god of hive creatures, she&rsquo;s paradoxically fond of individualism, and she encourages her followers to seek strength in community but recognize and embrace their individual value. Differences in doctrine and tradition among her followers are only natural, and while the Forever Queen of Nchak acts as supreme pontiff for her hive-based followers, shirrens are encouraged to have a more personal relationship with the divine.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/hylax.webp"}

Nyarlathotep is unusual among the Outer Gods in that he enjoys personally toying with and sowing discord among mortal races, rather than leaving this to his cultists. Scholars of the Outer Gods and the Dark Tapestry&mdash;the dark voids between galaxies or mysterious patches of emptiness within a galaxy, where such beings are thought to hold the most sway&mdash;believe that Nyarlathotep himself is the prime mover in preparing countless worlds for the devastating return of the devouring Great Old Ones, nudging events along in subtle ways to encourage various apocalyptic ends. It is said that one can see Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s influence in every major disaster or calamity if one looks hard enough and that he has had a hand in guiding entire civilizations into ruin.<br /><br />Each of Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s forms is associated with its own distinct cult, but the incarnation that most Pact Worlds species are familiar with is the Empty Traveler. Ostensibly appearing as a humanoid figure in a space suit that would not be out of place in any spaceport, closer scrutiny reveals a vacant helmet devoid of any head or face and a space suit filled with a formless mass of writhing tentacles. Other well-known manifestations include the Black Pharaoh (a humanoid being with connections to the ancient pre-Gap Golarion civilization of Osirion) and the Haunter of the Dark (a bat-like entity with a burning tri-lobed eye). In any form, the Crawling Chaos works to upend the status quo and cast down the mortal races from the heights of their achievements. As the deity of conspiracies and dangerous secrets, Nyarlathotep engineers the deaths of kings, presidents, and reformers to inexorably guide civilization toward anarchy.<br /><br />Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s faithful believe he is the Outer God who ties together the worship of all the Great Old Ones, and follow him as the one who will open the doors to the uncaring light of the stars. Occult scholars, crazed cultists, and those who seek suppressed knowledge or the proscribed mysteries of forgotten magics may pay homage to the Crawling Chaos, as do serial killers, violent revolutionaries, and anyone who desires to dismantle societal systems without regard for the cost. Secret temples to Nyarlathotep are spread throughout the Pact Worlds, but the center of his worship is on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn}, home to the infamous Pyramid of the Black Pharaoh. Some even whisper that Carsai the King, the enigmatic sovereign of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn} (see page 460), might be a herald or avatar of Nyarlathotep.</span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/nyarlathotep.webp"}

He is not a hasty deity, knowing that the expansion of civilization and law is gradual but inevitable. Only through discipline, hard work, and incisive judgment can one attain happiness and wealth. Risk is occasionally called for and can generate lucrative rewards, but only after careful planning and consideration of all known factors. Abadar favors neither good nor evil, as both sides have their benefits, but he supports employment over slavery, as paid workers can contribute their own accumulated wages to the commercial markets and thus the profitability of civilization as a whole.<br /><br />Abadar&rsquo;s most fervent worshipers are generally aristocrats, colonists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, politicians, and traders, but many poor people venerate the Master of the First Vault in hopes of attracting his attention and reversing their fortunes. The occasional artist or artisan who is devoted to Abadar strives to duplicate the perfect forms of the objects found within the god&rsquo;s realm with their own works. Followers of Abadar believe that he was responsible for elevating the sentient races of the galaxy from primitive tribes to technological civilizations, and many seek to follow his example when they encounter less advanced civilizations on newly discovered planets or when they establish new settlements and trade networks.<br /><br />Abadar&rsquo;s church, AbadarCorp (see page 473), is simultaneously a religious institution and one of the most successful and powerful corporations in the Pact Worlds. Its managers and executives serve as the church&rsquo;s priests, and the company&rsquo;s many offices, stores, trading outposts, and warehouses double as temples and can be found on almost every settled world. These structures are all built in an unmistakable and seemingly contradictory style&mdash;solid, practical construction (to protect against thieves) that is richly ornamented (to showcase the wealth that often resides within). Many of AbadarCorp&rsquo;s buildings also feature durable, translucent-ceramic windows tinted a vivid yellow to cast the interiors in a golden hue.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","img":"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/religious_symbols/abadar.webp"}
