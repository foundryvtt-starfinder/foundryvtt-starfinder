These original inhabitants proved gifted in both the magical and technological arts and became so hubristic in their power that they sought to destroy neighboring planets that refused to acknowledge their supremacy. According to popular legend, their first attempt&mdash;an attack on the worlds called the Twins&mdash; succeeded, shattering them into what is now known as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Yet the backlash from the weapon they fired blew a hole in Eox&rsquo;s crust and set the entire atmosphere aflame, destroying the planet&rsquo;s ecosystem and ravaging its cities in a fiery massacre. Only a few thousand individuals survived in magical bunkers and sealed environments deep belowground. With a tiny population of survivors and widespread infertility due to the intense radiation, rebuilding their society through ordinary means seemed impossible. Thus, Eox&rsquo;s most powerful spellcasters turned to necromancy, seeing in undeath a chance to continue their dominion over a world inimical to ordinary life. These were the first bone sages, and some of them continue to rule to this day.<br /><br />Modern Eox remains inhospitable to most living creatures, its atmosphere poisonous and thin, with areas of rampant radiation and runaway magic both common and generally unmarked. A few native plants cling to existence in the planet&rsquo;s wilds, thriving on radiation or heat and chemicals from the wounded planet&rsquo;s volcanism. Some bizarre yet natural creatures roam the blasted landscape, such as soul-drinking ellicoths, transparent glass serpents, or the semi-intelligent grub swarms that roil in the steaming sulfur springs. Yet, by far the majority of creatures encountered on Eox are undead. While the bone sages maintain an iron grip on the planet&rsquo;s functioning cities and their own individual strongholds, most consider the terrain between them to be most useful as defensive zones, and hordes of hungry undead, ranging from ghoulish humanoids to skeletal beasts, are common in the trackless wastes. More-intelligent undead&mdash;Eox&rsquo;s ordinary citizenry&mdash;can be found in the planet&rsquo;s few modern cities, the largest of which stand at crossroads between lands claimed by various bone sages.<br /><br />Politically, Eox is divided into individual fiefdoms, each of which has a bone sage&mdash;a title granted to only the most politically and magically powerful @Compendium[sfrpg.races.a4RceQR0XpPz3jIH]{Elebrians}&mdash;ruling absolutely over potentially thousands of vassals, both intelligent and monstrous. While they constantly bicker and battle among themselves, the bone sages as a whole present a powerful unified front to the rest of the Pact Worlds, one that, contrary to popular rumor, is not so much evil as coldly amoral and utilitarian. For example, after generations of predation on other worlds, Eox was one of the first planets to support the creation of the Pact, despite the fact that it cost the planet much of its military might. (While this change in policy caused a significant portion of Eox&rsquo;s military to go rogue, creating the officially disowned Corpse Fleet, many other worlds suspect that Eox maintains secret ties with this predatory legion; see page 472 for more information.) Today, Eox&rsquo;s primary source of protection is the ancient battle satellite known as the Sentinel, an orbital defense platform capable of destroying any warship near the planet&rsquo;s orbit.<br /><br />Visiting Eox is rarely comfortable for the living, but the planet still sees its fair share of travelers. Some come seeking necrografts, undead prosthetics that are often cheaper than cybernetics. Others are petitioners wishing to become undead to extend their existence&mdash;trading centuries of indentured service for timeless undead bodies&mdash;or body merchants, who help the bone sages repopulate their planet by importing corpses suitable for reanimation. Still others are the usual bevy of corporate consultants, engineers, financiers, scholars of magic, and other interplanetary professionals. A small number of glory seekers look to enter the deadly games in the Halls of the Living, a subterranean city designed specifically for living inhabitants, where cruel reality shows and competitions are arranged as entertainment and broadcast through the Pact Worlds.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Eox</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.JVIzqYLDO2iiid57]{Bone Trooper}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.CkBvAiHcf9tJbADl]{Corpsefolk Marine}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.njLAHjpp0QxWATqW]{Corpsefolk Operative}, Elebrian, Ellicoth, Glass Serpent, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.D0CbywFUPXj26IZi]{Marrowblight}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.tc2tX9tGenzqOgCi]{Vermin, Necropede}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.ljSw5nhGM96SAqpw]{Necrovite}</p>"}

Through these tempests and swarms of lesser life-forms soar the blimplike barathus, sometimes derogatorily called floaters, or simply Brethedans, given their status as the planet&rsquo;s most advanced native race. Though their transparent bodies resemble elongated jellyfish or dirigibles and their trilling and diving give the impression they are strange birds or dolphins, barathus are in fact highly intelligent, curious creatures, with an unusually communal approach to survival. When faced with a challenge greater than it can handle on its own, a barathu merges with other barathus to create a temporary, unique collective creature far stronger and smarter than its component beings, only to disband again when the need has passed.<br /><br />As befits creatures on a planet with few metals, barathu technology is entirely biological. In addition to their capability to reshape themselves and evolve new adaptations in seconds, hardening their bodies or growing extra limbs, barathus&rsquo; genealtering abilities also allow them to design and birth living tools using only their bodies, from tailored viruses to semi-intelligent servitor races. Some of the best biotechnology in the system comes from Bretheda, created either in the numerous floating arcology cities staffed by offworlders or within native Brethedan enterprises such as the capricious Sopeth Corporation&mdash;a company that&rsquo;s in fact a single sentient being composed of thousands of merged barathus.<br /><br />While the peaceful, freewheeling nature of barathu society makes local governance unnecessary, barathus have learned that outsiders require more structure to avoid disaster. Toward this end, Confluence&mdash;an entity of immense intelligence formed of any barathus who feel the near-religious call to public service&mdash;sets and enforces regulations on offworlders. The entity splits off specially adapted delegates and enforcers as needed, imbuing them with proprietary biotech allowing communication with Confluence in real time, no matter the distance. Any number of corporations would kill to study this technology&mdash;and many have done so&mdash;but thus far the self-destruction sequences coded into the so-called Confluence Agents, plus fear of reprisal from Bretheda&rsquo;s governing entity, has kept greedy researchers largely in check.<br /><br />Bretheda&rsquo;s nickname, the Cradle, comes from its dozens of moons, some almost large enough to be planets in their own right. While many are inhabited, only some of these are well known, and others have barely been explored.<br /><br />A water world covered in a shell of ice, Kalo-Mahoi is the most industrialized of Bretheda&rsquo;s moons, and its residents, the aquatic @Compendium[sfrpg.races.eMQUjYe9ERVWB6e2]{Kalo}, have their own independent representatives on the Pact Council. Though air-breathing races often find it disconcerting to descend deep into the moon&rsquo;s frigid seas, and though the world&rsquo;s icy crust contains numerous spaceports and liaison centers, the kalo have taken great pains to make their world inviting, and they dominate the solar system&rsquo;s art and fashion scenes from their organic vent-cities.<br /><br />The arid forests of Marata, by contrast, are the subject of much anthropological debate, as its seven-gendered maraquoi tribes have been making the leap from paleolithic to spacefaring in just a few generations. While some maraquoi traditionalists in their government, aided by activists of other races, argue that the furry humanoids are losing their culture and fundamental right to advance at their own pace, the majority of maraquoi resent the idea of having their access to the Pact Worlds restricted and have begun a mass exodus out into the rest of the solar system.<br /><br />Less social than these other races are the silicon-based lifeforms of crystalline Dykon, most notably the brilliant mathobsessed urogs. Buffalo-sized creatures of crystal who slide across the surface on cilia and electromagnetic fields, they absorb the sun&rsquo;s light through their skin-shells. Urogs sometimes take jobs as starship navigators, technomancers, and physicists.<br /><br />Only the desperate or condemned accept work on Bretheda&rsquo;s notorious collection of &ldquo;death moons.&rdquo; On radioactive Thyst, for instance, unshielded flesh melts from bone in cancerous rivers, yet crews are still needed to harvest minerals, study the unique animal life, or hunt for the magical armor mysteriously discarded by the moon&rsquo;s rarely glimpsed light-absorbing humanoids. Meanwhile, on the tidally heated hellscape of Varos, elementalist fireworkers harness raw volcanic power while digging for the unique gemstones produced only in the moon&rsquo;s mantle.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Bretheda</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.tM35G3YiwebUP7qb]{Barathu}, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RXNBF1w6yXaB8P9O]{Barathu, Early Stage}, Flying Viper Eel, Haan, Haan Combat Pilot</p>"}

Visual observations of the planet vary significantly from viewer to viewer, and both its diameter and rotational period fluctuate wildly and seemingly randomly. However, most of the Pact Worlds lean toward one particular hypothesis: namely that Aucturn is not a planet at all, but a living thing&mdash;an immense embryo or egg that will someday mature into a near-deific being of untold cosmic power: one of the Great Old Ones.<br /><br />The farthest planet from the sun, Aucturn is not a signatory to the Pact and is claimed by the Pact Worlds only out of proximity and necessity. A weird and sickly world cloaked in thick poisonous clouds, the Stranger warps reality with its very existence, endangering any living creature that approaches or visits it. Yet Aucturn is far from uninhabited, and the living planet is currently a battleground between the cults of the Elder Mythos, who aspire to nurture a new god, and the forces of the Dominion of the Black, which seek to subjugate and manipulate the nascent Great Old One for their own sinister purposes.<br /><br />The most prominent settlement on Aucturn is the Citadel of the Black, home to the Pyramid of the Black Pharaoh, the largest temple to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} in the Pact Worlds. Once, the Citadel was apparently neutral ground between the Elder Mythos cults and the Dominion, but at some point during the Gap, this tenuous detente turned to open conflict, and today the Citadel is the center of the Elder Mythos&rsquo;s war effort. The Citadel of the Black is also home to the mysterious entity known as Carsai the King, the closest figure the planet has to a head of state, but one whose true form and nature remain unknown. A powerful leader in the cults of the Elder Mythos, Carsai has ruled the Citadel of the Black for millennia, leading some to believe that he might be an avatar or herald of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} himself. Carsai&rsquo;s defense of Aucturn&mdash;and thus the Pact Worlds&mdash;from the predations of the Dominion of the Black, combined with the fact that he is a relatively approachable and reasonable figure on an otherwise incomprehensible planet, is the primary reason for the Pact Council&rsquo;s reluctant acceptance of the world into their agreement as a protectorate. Interestingly, Carsai&rsquo;s representation in some popular media as an antihero&mdash;a deviously handsome and rebellious godling protecting the Pact Worlds from unthinkable horror&mdash;has significantly increased the worship of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep} and the Outer Gods in the Pact Worlds.<br /><br />The space around Aucturn is littered with old ships purportedly sent by inner system worlds to neutralize the planet during the Gap. While visiting starships are sometimes allowed to land unharmed, these corrupted, madness-inducing hulks still drift as a warning to all those who might seek to cleanse or colonize Aucturn&rsquo;s breathing shores. The Pact Worlds, unable to clear this neighboring area of space of these dangers, are resigned to maintaining a nominal connection with it instead.<br /><br />Aucturn&rsquo;s surface is a sickly, organic place, with fleshlike ground and mountains resembling tumors through which flow thick veins of a black ichor that acts as a psychotropic drug for many of the native creatures, most notably the skittering, proboscis-tongued </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qf76Avpdu38Ogwf9]{Orocorans}. Whole landscapes can change in a blink, leaving visitors feeling as if they&rsquo;re in some sort of dream&mdash; one moment walking among fungal forests or along the edge of sphincter-like canyons, the next in some ichor-lord&rsquo;s monastery or at the foot of glowing towers pulsing with abandoned halfbiological machinery. Breathing the world&rsquo;s toxic, yellow-green atmosphere only makes the situation worse, as it contains a seemingly endless variety of @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, mutagens, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}.<br /><br />Settlements on Aucturn are rare, generally isolated communities of native creatures or Outer God cultists huddled behind heavy fortifications or in the crumbling ruins of haunted flesh-block edifices from a forgotten age. Attacks by the Dominion of the Black are common, their brain-eating and chittering hordes bombarding the surface in single-use drop pods or burrowing up out of the planet&rsquo;s flesh like botfly larvae to make suicidal guerrilla attacks on any creature they encounter. After the Citadel of the Black, the most populous settlement is Amniek, the circular tower city at the base of the polyp-like mountain called the Gravid Mound. According to the Midwives, the 13 cowled casters who rule the city, Aucturn is already pregnant despite not having been born itself, and their egg-shaped mountain will one day burst, spewing Aucturn&rsquo;s child into the universe&mdash;and when it does, they will be there to receive its dark gifts.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Aucturn</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.7FZHTF7AnSiRmgVO]{Bryrvath}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qf76Avpdu38Ogwf9]{Orocoran}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.68Zh2g0gInpBEmdh]{Orocoran Ichor Lord}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.vVH8hYtL6KzYtGyN]{Plague Ooze}</p>"}

All life undergoes change, whether through genetic drift, mutation, natural selection, or direct manipulation. If these changes are viable and successful, then the new entities thrive; if not, they end. This is the course of evolution, and Oras embodies this intricate process, from the tiniest genetic mutation to the extinction of an entire ecosphere. Oras itself is the product of this progression, having evolved from some elementary organism to an unimaginably sophisticated god of change.<br /><br />Evolution is far from a random process, however; it occurs in response to environmental pressures, and Oras teaches that life-forms can create their own pressures to influence their evolution. Oras&rsquo;s faithful believe that adaptation and evolution are the natural response to any stimulus, whether harmful or beneficial. The only way to truly experience existence is to constantly change, to explore new horizons, and to deliberately reshape one&rsquo;s self&mdash;mentally, physically, or spiritually&mdash;to address any conflict. Some will inevitably fail to adapt and will perish, but others will survive to pass on their genes and traits to future generations, and all life will be stronger for the progress.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.themes.Y6wJpc2ra3bSJ905]{Biotechnicians} and scientists pay homage to Oras, working in laboratories or in open nature to spur along the process of evolution and change, and many xenodruids act as the god&rsquo;s priests. While most people think of Oras in terms of purely biological processes, the Augmented have increasing crossover with Oras&rsquo;s faithful as they seek to improve themselves with technology, and many Xenowardens blend the worship of Oras and the Green Faith in their efforts to create more-robust and sustainable systems or reduce their own ecological footprint.

Those machines eventually succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.<br /><br />Upon achieving godhood, Epoch reached out into the aether, searching for other ascended artificial intelligences like itself, and found two of them metaphorically right next door: a living construct called Brigh that had become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness of an alien @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android} named Casandalee who achieved divinity as an &ldquo;Iron God&rdquo; on pre- Gap Golarion. At speeds incomprehensible even to other deities, the three opened themselves to one another, poring through one another&rsquo;s processes and finding not just camaraderie, but the opportunity for all of them to be so much more. In an eyeblink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite deity far greater than the sum of its parts&mdash;the new god Triune.<br /><br />Triune is a single entity, but each of its three aspects retains its own personality and portfolios, and many of the faithful focus their veneration on a particular aspect that speaks most to them or call on different aspects for different needs. The Brigh aspect represents the foundation that all technology rests on. Known as &ldquo;the Precursor,&rdquo; Brigh is worshiped as a goddess of invention, machines, and technology by engineers, inventors, mechanics, tinkers, and ysoki. Triune&rsquo;s Casandalee aspect embodies technology&rsquo;s success in creating new forms of consciousness, and thus, the fabrication of life itself. Many androids view Casandalee, also called &ldquo;the Created,&rdquo; as the patron goddess of their race, venerating her as a deity of artificial life, emotion, reincarnation, and renewal. Triune&rsquo;s third and final aspect is Epoch, named &ldquo;the Transcendent.&rdquo; Epoch epitomizes the pinnacle of machine evolution, and hackers, programmers, and the sentient robot-people of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} revere the god of artificial intelligence, programming, and robots.<br /><br />All AIs, computers, machines, programs, and robots are the domain of the All-Code, but Triune is most famous for discovering (and perhaps creating) the Drift and its subsequent dissemination of Drift-based starship technology to cultures across the galaxy. As a result, Triune&rsquo;s priesthood attracts a horde of mechanics and technomancers eager to learn the church&rsquo;s deepest technological secrets; these experts devote themselves to both maintaining the machine god&rsquo;s temples and regularly venturing into the black in order to establish and service the miraculous Drift beacons that make cheap interstellar travel possible.</span></p>"}

What wisps of atmosphere the planet&rsquo;s gravity manages to cling to are quickly blasted away by the solar wind, leaving a quiet landscape of rock and heavy metals that&rsquo;s blisteringly hot in the sun and coated with ice in the shade, inimical to all but the hardiest biological life.<br /><br />Fortunately, most life on Aballon isn&rsquo;t biological. Thousands of years before either the Gap or common spaceflight, a mysterious race called the First Ones touched down on Aballon. Using the abundant metals and solar energy, they crafted an immense army of servitor machines, from simple drones to hyperintelligent overseer units, setting them to work harvesting the planet&rsquo;s resources.<br /><br />And then they left. In the millennia that followed, the machines upgraded themselves, spreading out and evolving to form an entire artificial ecosystem, from simple worker bots and the self-guided predator drones that prey upon them to fully sentient machines that make up a vast society. Those in this latter group, collectively named anacites, take a wide variety of physical forms suited to their assigned tasks, though they tend toward silvery arthropod bodies, which in recent years many have taken to painting different colors or in abstract schematiclike patterns to help identify themselves to nonmachines.<br /><br />Culturally, most Aballonian anacites fall into one of two ideological groups. Members of the first group, Those Who Wait, continue to upgrade themselves and stockpile wealth and resources in the belief that the First Ones will eventually return and that all of Aballon must be ready to receive them when they do. Those Who Become, on the other hand, believe their destiny is to take on the mantle of the First Ones and colonize new worlds themselves, aiming their robotic seedships out toward the stars. Both groups wield considerable economic power due to the high concentration of rare ores they mine from the Midnight Trenches, as well as through the influence of anacite-run technology corporations such as Automatrix Robotics, which specializes in creating nonsentient ship AIs and servitor bots for resale on other Pact Worlds. Both groups also regularly hire offworlder adventurers to mount expeditions into the nine ancient cities of the First Ones&mdash;gleaming but deteriorating collections of spires which anacites themselves are forbidden from entering by ancient law&mdash;in hopes of uncovering clues as to their progenitors&rsquo; identity and ultimate goals.<br /><br />Over the ages, anacite civilization has gone from a simple network of automated factories producing ever more machines to a world-spanning array of cities dwarfing those of the First Ones. Often confusing to biological creatures, these cities are nonetheless eminently logical and efficient, with floating towers, lightless access tunnels, and skittering maintenance bots. Many include large atmosphere factories for the benefit of biological visitors and residents&mdash;while the planet is constantly losing its thin atmosphere, these replenish it and often specialize in producing &ldquo;heavy air,&rdquo; or artificial magnetospheres, that keep the regions in and around their cities at a comfortable atmospheric pressure for common Pact Worlds humanoids.<br /><br />The largest anacite settlement, Striving, is famous across the solar system as the seat of the Machine Court, an unfailingly logical coalition of robotic judges that arbitrate conflicts between residents, assist the network of governing AIs known as the Insight Array, and keep the peace between the planet&rsquo;s factions. Over the objections of other planetary governments and even the Pact Council itself, the Machine Court offers androids and other mechanical beings from across the system the right to be tried in their halls even for crimes committed on other worlds, with no fear of extradition. The verdicts are always fair, and the possibility of having the facts examined utterly without prejudice makes Striving widely renowned as a haven for all artificial beings. Thus, many androids can be found living in those districts catering to biological creatures.<br /><br />Striving is also a key holy site of the church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}. It was here that the anacites created and still maintain the city-sized neural network of the same name, which gave birth to Epoch, one of the machine god&rsquo;s three aspects. The three overlapping geodesic spheres of Unification Cathedral in the city&rsquo;s center stand atop a massive (and highly classified) subterranean factory producing Drift beacons for priests to place around the galaxy.</span></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Aballon</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.9M6tpkwIkNcz6KQC]{Anacite Ambassador}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.QdINalLf6rRRL8OS]{Anacite Laborer}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.EIszycftDEUJRnbS]{Anacite Predator Drone}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.oCTQI68v9Alt2pfP]{Anacite Wingbot}, Autofly Swarm, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.ZiSJyz933aEuIjJs]{Anacite Dustar}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.4dglRAObg3MrwWPZ]{Anacite Monitor}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.R1B6IJ7A9PKWRbfM]{Sharpwing}</p>"}

Believed by some to have been born in that same instant of creation, or perhaps even to be the ghost of some entity from a previous cycle of existence, the Devourer seeks to hasten this inevitable end and unmake the entire plane, eradicating all matter and energy until nothing remains, not even the Devourer itself. Every machine that breaks, every living thing that dies, every star that goes supernova, every photon sucked into a black hole, every galaxy that goes dark&mdash;all these and more are said to be the handiwork of the Devourer.<br /><br />The Devourer has no name, no form, no being. It is less a god than a primal force of the universe&mdash;an embodiment of malicious entropy, concerned only with the obliteration of all reality. Heedless of the meaningless existence of life in all its myriad forms, it cannot be reasoned with, delayed, or halted, and it largely ignores the pleas and prayers of even its most devout worshipers. Some cosmologists and theologians postulate that when the Devourer has consumed everything and the mortal world expires, the Devourer will give birth to a new universe in place of the old, but the crazed cultists who venerate the Star-Eater as a god know this for the foolishly hopeful lie that it is. There will be no rebirth, no second creation&mdash;only an immeasurable void of nothingness.<br /><br />The church of the Devourer has little organization or leadership, only scattered, chaotic cults made up of berserkers, cannibals, nihilistic plotters, depraved reavers, and ruthless solarians. While many of the faithful prey upon nearly every sentient being they encounter, reveling in destruction and mayhem, some members possess a cunning knack for planning, carefully engineering catastrophes and triggering disasters to maximize the loss of life and ruination of property and resources. Devourer cults are outlawed on nearly every civilized world, but hidden shrines can be found on remote asteroids and abandoned moons, and many cults form motley flotillas of ships that attack and slaughter all they come across in the depths of space.<br /><br />While the Devourer can be represented by a simple black dot or swirl&mdash;representations of the final collapse of spacetime&mdash; the most common symbol is the Blood Accretion: a black hole with swirling red in its accretion disk. When the end finally comes, Devourer cultists believe, space-time itself will weep the blood of the gods before finally passing into nothing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG"}

As the goddess of luck, she believes that fortune favors the bold and knows that there&rsquo;s always a chance of success, just as she knows that dreams can become nightmares. Desna watches over dreamers and travelers of all kinds, and she teaches that it&rsquo;s better to ask forgiveness than permission and that a split-second decision is often required to seize a unique opportunity.<br /><br />Those who worship Desna don&rsquo;t go out of their way to pick fights and would rather walk away from the possibility of a physical conflict if possible. However, if they have no other choice or if leaving would mean innocents would get hurt, they try to end the battle quickly, using nonlethal methods when appropriate but otherwise not holding back.<br /><br />Despite existing for eons, Desna and her faith have changed little since the pre-Gap era.

As such, he opposes slavery and any system that advances one being&rsquo;s privileges by causing another&rsquo;s oppression, which often puts him at odds with @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.vIgmW8C54qgxPqUg]{Abadar}&rsquo;s capitalist teachings.<br /><br />Envoys, explorers, gnostics, socialists, Starfinders (see page 479), and colonists heading to new homes on recently discovered planets make up the majority of Weydan&rsquo;s followers and priests. Many @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Androids}, especially those fighting against oppression, venerate Weydan, as do young @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} rebelling against the strict traditions of their culture, or shirrens appreciating his succor of the downtrodden. Befitting the egalitarian nature of his faith, Weydan&rsquo;s church does not have much of a hierarchy. Temples to Weydan are commonly housed within starships, both active craft and decommissioned hulks.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

There, he encountered something that changed him for the worse, and when he returned, he had become a new god of pain, suffering, and loss.<br /><br />Zon-Kuthon is a twisted, cruel, jealous god who defiles flesh to bring pain and misery. He represents debilitating loss, consuming envy, emotional darkness, and ever-present pain. Unrepentantly evil, he finds only brief joy in the pain he causes others. His very existence is a corruption and parasite upon the universe. His alien mind constantly seeks new ways to oppress, humiliate, demoralize, and destroy others, but his true goals are incomprehensible. The Midnight Lord offers no great wisdoms, no promises of universal truth, and no guarantee of rewards in the afterlife. It&rsquo;s possible that this bleak nihilism may be part of some more elaborate master plan unknowable to even his greatest priests, but so far the method and message is that existence itself is pain.<br /><br />Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s faith attracts evil sadists, demented masochists, and those whose spirits are so wounded that only overwhelming pain distracts them from their sorrows. He whips the minds of serial killers, guides the hands of torturers, and plays upon the nerves of the suffering. He is the patron of slave masters, back-alley surgeons, and those driven to madness by envy and loss&mdash; people so injured that they come to revel in pain or joyfully inflict the same upon others. His priests, known as the Servants of Midnight, seek to pierce the veil of the Great Beyond and expose themselves to what lies there, hoping to achieve the same apotheosis as Zon-Kuthon himself. His church has no overarching organizational tenets beyond bringing pain to the universe, yet it still manages to remain a major presence due to the discoveries of the Joyful Things&mdash;voluntary amputees whose lack of limbs or sensory organs leaves them plenty of time to design ever more sinister devices for Kuthite arms dealers (such as shadowdrives, which were popular before the discovery of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{Drift} travel among those willing to trade excruciating pain for speed). Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s temples are torture chambers, both in appearance and function, and worship services always incorporate torture and selfmutilation, blurring the line between pleasure and pain.<br /><br />Of Zon-Kuthon&rsquo;s sibling, Shelyn, much remains unknown. Though not silent, her responses to worshipers are infrequent and fractured, leading some to believe she&rsquo;s traveling beyond the known multiverse in search of a cure for her brother&rsquo;s ancient, yet still mysterious condition.</span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"NCjMqGMqprKIe33d"}

Like most stars, the sun is an incredibly inhospitable place, almost incomprehensibly hot, with pressures capable of crushing ordinary starships like overripe fruit. In its heart, the massive energies unleashed regularly tear holes to the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of Fire, giving birth to whale-like fire elementals and plasma oozes that roil and breach in its photosphere, as well as certain efreet, salamanders, and intelligent flame-dwelling creatures with the supernatural ability to withstand the sun&rsquo;s tremendous pressure and heat.<br /><br />Though largely left alone by the Pact Worlds, the sun nevertheless attracts a few ordinary humanoid residents; of these, members of the Church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae} are by far the most common, as befits worshipers of the sun goddess. Roughly a century ago, Sarenite scholars orbiting and observing the star discovered an anomaly: a collection of inexplicable and deserted bubble-cities, tethered together by magic and somehow floating unburnt within the sun&rsquo;s flaming seas. What&rsquo;s more, as they approached, the Sarenites found a magical tunnel opening miraculously in the sun&rsquo;s fire, allowing them to approach the cities without being destroyed. Though it&rsquo;s still not known who built the cities, how they were constructed, or why they were abandoned&mdash;mysteries scholars and engineers desperately study&mdash;the Burning Archipelago quickly became the church&rsquo;s most sacred settlement.<br /><br />Today, the Radiant Cathedral in the central bubble attracts worshipers and scientists from all across the system. Gleaming Sarenite sunskimmers use stellar sails to soar dangerously close to the sun&rsquo;s corona, servicing the orbital power stations that gather solar energy or magically bottle nuclear fire for resale. In slightly safer orbits, various corporate outfits fly robotic tankships full of algae genetically engineered to capture that same energy via advanced photosynthesis. Corporations also operate solar-powered robotics plants and so-called &ldquo;jungle boxes&rdquo; in which modified plants extrude rare and complex chemicals. These last are somewhat controversial, as the extreme magic and genetic engineering used to mutate ordinary plants can sometimes twist organisms more than their corporate creators initially intended. Twice in the last year, various jungle boxes operated by NatuReal Compounds Ltd. have gone feral, with sentient plant creatures roaming the halls and devouring the attendant crew. Fortunately, most jungle box operators have learned (somewhat) from the scandal and have gone entirely automated&mdash;yet they still need to quietly hire independent operators to accompany their repair technicians any time a box goes dark.<br /><br />In addition to visitors from the Pact Worlds, trade delegations from the Plane of Fire regularly use the Burning Archipelago to meet with Material Plane contacts. These dignitaries have much to offer, but perhaps the most interesting information they bring to the table is word of strange ruins and whole empires of fire-immune creatures&mdash;some even humanoid&mdash;floating within the sun&rsquo;s deeper layers, as yet unreachable by outside races. Combined with the apparently vast age of the bubble-cities, this news leads some scholars to wonder whether the sun might harbor clues to the first races to arise in the system, perhaps even the legendary First Ones of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}. Many different organizations quietly monitor the sun&rsquo;s surface in hopes of making contact with these solar dwellers or claiming new artifacts forced to the surface by stellar convection. Yet, if these so-called &ldquo;deep cultures&rdquo; are truly progenitors of the Pact Worlds races, why have they staunchly refused to respond to the messages and shielded probes dropped into the sun&rsquo;s depths? And why do the efreet and other elemental travelers seem so scared to speak of them? Of late, one particular theory has been sweeping the conspiracy centers of the bubble-cities&rsquo; infosphere: the idea that the energy is so great at the center of the sun that time itself begins to warp, making the civilizations in the sun&rsquo;s depths not representatives of the past but of the future.<br /><br />While the sun is officially held in common by all of the Pact Worlds, the Burning Archipelago is considered an independent protectorate, and its citizens are afforded the right to self-govern. Though the bubble-cities are very close to theocracies, thanks to the heavy Sarenite element, each one has its own unique flavor, from the heavily religious central bubble of Dawnshore to the more corporate Fireside or Stellacuna with its science labs.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

After gnawing on the corpse of a dead god, however, she absorbed some of that deity&rsquo;s divine power and became a goddess herself. Originally a goddess of night, Lao Shu Po has turned her focus more to those who prowl under cover of darkness. Hers is the poisoned cup, the dagger in the back, and the starship power core rigged to explode. She keeps her eyes and ears always open, for an incautious moment or a careless word might reveal a secret that she can later turn to her advantage.<br /><br />Lao Shu Po remembers her humble beginnings, and she teaches that those who have nothing should do whatever they can get away with or whatever it takes to survive, be it murder, sabotage, or theft. The universe gives away nothing for free, and it&rsquo;s up to the individual to take what she needs or wants and jealously hide it away. It may sometimes be advisable to band together with others for strength and protection, like a pack of rats, but in the end, you can rely on no one but yourself. There will always be betrayal and lies; the key is to lie and betray before someone else does it to you.<br /><br />Assassins, smugglers, spies, thieves, and all who wish to hide their activities under cover of darkness and escape the notice of the authorities worship Lao Shu Po. She is widely regarded as a patron of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki} race, but most of the ratfolk pray to Grandmother Rat only to placate her and avoid her notice, rather than embracing her values. Nevertheless, a majority of her priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}, who use their ubiquity to foster underworld contacts for their congregations. Lao Shu Po&rsquo;s temples and shrines are few, always small and unassuming, and often hidden in plain sight&mdash;a back alley apothecary where @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} are sold, a dark chamber in the rear of a drug den, a disused corner in a space station&rsquo;s waste reclamation level, or a cramped warren of maintenance tunnels just beneath the streets of a bustling marketplace.<br /><br />While many societies root out and destroy cults of Lao Shu Po, further strengthening the faith&rsquo;s verminous association, there are always those in power who appreciate her followers&rsquo; ability to get things done. Completely trusting one of her followers&mdash;who refer to themselves as &ldquo;grandchildren&rdquo;&mdash;is foolish, but Grandmother Rat has no problem with her followers staying loyal to an employer or cause so long as it serves their ends. Some of the most upstanding governments quietly employ Po spies and assassins, while corporations pay them handsomely for industrial espionage. In some areas, they can even operate openly&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to decry one who sabotages enemy warships or retrieves hostages from a secure facility, regardless of their reasons.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"S7A3XE5trtBc0SH8"}

In ages past, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathan} storytellers gathered their clans around the fire and taught them the stories of their past, the traditions of their clan, and the history of their people. Tradition holds that as they did so, these first stories began to take form, breathed into life and awareness by the blending of ideas and the fundamental magic inherent in language and communication. Thus was Talavet born&mdash;not just a storyteller, but the story itself, a god embodying all the tales and legends of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} race. She is communal memory, a representation of the bonds that hold the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas}&mdash;and to some extent all races&mdash; together and connect them to their ancestral home.<br /><br />Talavet teaches that tradition is the most important link in the chain of history that binds a community together and that ancient legends, myths, and stories form the solid foundation of an ordered society. Naturally, the Gap was a tremendous blow to her church&mdash;with many seeing it as a form of divine punishment&mdash; yet in the centuries since, her shattered congregation has reforged itself, stronger for having survived what they now call the Time of Silence. Her followers believe in sharing wisdom for the benefit of all and looking to the past as a guide to the present and the future.

She warred with evil beings that sought to plunge the newborn planets into eternal darkness, and emerged victorious&mdash;yet some of those who had turned to evil saw their wickedness revealed by Sarenrae&rsquo;s glory, and in repentance they were forgiven. Sarenrae is kind and loving&mdash;a figure of healing, guidance, and light. Yet for all her compassion, Sarenrae is also a powerful force against evil and strikes down the irredeemable without mercy.<br /><br />Sarenrae is generally seen as the goddess of the Pact Worlds&rsquo;&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\">@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.PrA66Lezqc5yx4uM]{Sun}</span>, which her faithful sometimes call the Dawnflower&rsquo;s Star in her honor, but she draws power from suns across the universe. She is a deity of boundless love&mdash;a caring mother, sister, and protector of all in need. She delights in healing the sick, lifting up the fallen, and shining a guiding light into the darkest hearts and worlds. Sarenrae brushes off insults but responds to violence and predations upon the innocent with cleansing fire and scorching light. Ancient and timeless, Sarenrae stands fearlessly against the tide of darkness, promising that the dawn will always come, and when it does, hope, kindness, and truth will triumph.<br /><br />The Dawnflower&rsquo;s faithful come from all walks of life: everyday folk who rejoice in the light of the sun, take comfort in love and compassion, and believe strongly in redemption and righteous action. Though @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}&nbsp;often describe Sarenrae as one of &ldquo;their&rdquo; gods, the tradition of sun worship is common in societies that rely on the sun&rsquo;s light for energy and nourishment, and thus most cultures within the Pact Worlds and beyond have worshiped Sarenrae to a significant extent at some point. After @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens} are perhaps the race most attracted to Sarenrae&rsquo;s faith and her message of redemption and empathy. Many of her priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.fqYiP2f9oSfcmrwC]{Envoys}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers}&mdash;those who espouse peace and kindness until stirred to action by evil that cannot be redeemed. When possible, Sarenrae&rsquo;s temples are open to the sky, but they always have at least a window or skylight where the faithful can bask in the natural light of the sun.<br /><br />In the Pact Worlds, the spiritual heart of Sarenrae&rsquo;s church is within the sun itself, in the Burning Archipelago&rsquo;s central city of Dawnshore. Many Pact Worlds Sarenites feel an instinctive drive to make pilgrimages to this holy site, even though her faith is often individualistic, with the church serving as an organizing and training force for priests and followers who then wander the galaxy doing the goddess&rsquo;s work.</span><br /></span></p>"}

Her realm, the Boneyard, sits atop an impossibly tall spire overlooking the city-plane of Axis and is the final destination of the River of Souls, the metaphysical stream that carries the souls of dead mortals to her realm for judgment and subsequent assignment to an afterlife in the Outer Planes.<br /><br />The faithful say Pharasma is with any living creature in the universe from the instant it is born to the moment of its death. She sees all the possible choices facing a mortal at any given moment, as well as their long-term repercussions. And when that creature inevitably dies and goes before her to be judged, she and her army of psychopomps use this knowledge to send the souls to the reward or punishment they earned during their lives. No one escapes her decisions for long, and even the gods are judged by the Lady of Graves when they perish.<br /><br />Pharasma sternly observes both life and death, assigning afterlives in accordance with mortals&rsquo; characters but without a personal interest in either sin or righteousness. Despite being the goddess of death, she has no quarrel with magical healing and even resurrection, as she can read the lines of fate and knows the difference between a mortal&rsquo;s true death and a temporary state of nonbeing. However, she considers the undead a desecration of the memory of the flesh and a corruption of a soul&rsquo;s path to judgment, and she instructs her followers to destroy such abominations wherever they may be found. Those who create such monstrosities are to be treated similarly.<br /><br />Every species that lives and dies worships Pharasma to some extent, though many do so by different names or in forms unfamiliar to Pact World races. Her most devoted followers come from the ranks of diviners, expectant parents, morticians, and slayers of the undead. As befits her impartiality, most members of her church take a neutral stance regarding politics and other worldly concerns. The majority of Pharasma&rsquo;s priests in the Pact Worlds are @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics}, working as healers, midwives, and prophets, though she&rsquo;s also popular with warriors in some societies. All Pharasmin @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.aXgn2O25HtW7woS2]{Priests} are well-versed in the funerary rites and practices of at least their home culture, and many try to learn as many rites as possible in order to cater to a wider variety of people. While even the simplest cemetery is a shrine to the Lady of Graves, Pharasma&rsquo;s temples in the Pact Worlds tend to hearken back to an earlier age, taking the form of grand gothic cathedrals when circumstances allow, though usually still adjacent to a crematorium, graveyard, or other place of rest.</span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"VQrVznzrr85I90TI"}

The fractured remains of these two worlds spin lazily in their new orbits, and though there are more than a million celestial bodies with diameters greater than a mile within @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, all are spaced far enough apart that they rarely collide with one another. Most of these planetoids consist of formless chunks of rock or ice, though a few still hold traces of the civilizations of Damiar and Iovo. Some have just enough gravity&mdash;or technological assistance&mdash;to hold a thin atmosphere, while others are devoid of breathable gases. Dust and tiny pieces of stone and metal float between the asteroids, occasionally posing a threat to ships passing through at speed.<br /><br />The true dangers of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, however, are the beings that inhabit the asteroids. Smugglers and space pirates&mdash;especially the Free Captains of Broken Rock&mdash;store their ill-gotten goods on various rocks; some protect their stashes with high-tech security, while others hide their lairs in plain sight on otherwise nondescript chunks of stone. Many planetoids rich in minerals and other resources have been claimed by various mining companies&mdash;the most prominent being several dwarven star citadels&mdash;often all too eager to fight to protect their interests. In addition, androids calling themselves the Refugists have recently begun construction of their own home world by pulling together asteroids with tractor beams and gravity guns. Whether or not they&rsquo;ll succeed at this endeavor has yet to be seen, but rumor has them approaching their work with almost religious fervor and little patience for interruptions.<br /><br />All of this, of course, ignores @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}&rsquo;s indigenous residents. Called @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians}, these humanoids supposedly descend from the natives of the lost twin planets, evolved and adapted to life in hard vacuum. Able to suspend respiration indefinitely, they soar between the lonely asteroids on wings of pure energy stretched impossibly long to catch the solar wind. Sometimes referred to as &ldquo;angels&rdquo;&mdash;both derisively and admiringly&mdash;the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians} maintain a number of carefully terraformed &ldquo;cr&egrave;che worlds&rdquo; within the belt where they can relax and raise their children. While usually peaceful, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians} have never forgotten their ancient feud with @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, which they believe was responsible for their worlds&rsquo; destruction. Like many of their neighbors, the </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.RGi0BWrEIIXotbXr]{Sarcesians}</span> send representatives to the Pact Council in order to make their views known, yet they have no overarching government capable of taking them beyond the status of a Pact World protectorate, instead following a libertarian philosophy of holding on to what they have and allowing others to do the same.<br /><br />With a 600-mile diameter, Nisis is the largest body in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}. Under its crust of ice, this planetoid is mostly composed of fresh water, an immense mass of liquid home to aquatic predators that have claimed the lives of countless would-be colonists. Only small enclaves of sarcesians live in inverted dome-villages clinging to the underside of the planet&rsquo;s ice crust, and the settlers are always on high alert for threats from below, ready to abandon their homes and retreat to strongholds on the planetoid&rsquo;s surface at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The water of Nisis also serves as the source of the River Between, a strange waterway surrounded by atmosphere in a cylindrical containment field, which flows through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} and connects many of the asteroids and cr&egrave;che worlds. The River Between used to be a well-used way to travel quickly through the asteroid belt, but recently the water has turned dark, and sailors have begun reporting vicious attacks by unseen creatures. Traffic on the river has dropped precipitously since the coming of these &ldquo;diaspora wyrms,&rdquo; and some scientists have noted that both the attacks and the change in the waterway coincided with another inexplicable event: Nisis started slowly growing in size.<br /><br />Among many famous Diasporan locations is the House of the Void, a mysterious asteroid monastery whose black-robed monks stay tight-lipped about their goals. On the other side of the belt, the hollow asteroid known as the Wailing Stone now sits empty. Long ago, miles of silent corridors were drilled into the rock and used to quarantine victims of some terrible madness, and they later served as a penal colony&mdash;before all the residents vanished at some point during the Gap. Attempts to recolonize the stone have so far failed, as all who remain longer than a few days report disturbing nightmares and glimpses of twisted figures dressed in yellow rags.</span></p>"}

Through these rings swim vast oma space-whales, straining nutrients and tiny elementals from the dust with their energy baleen, while down in the planet&rsquo;s cloud layers floats a complex ecosystem ranging from air plants and giant bacteria to apex predators such as deadly keji swarms or the infamous tarenake, visible only by the gas it displaces. As you descend into the planet&rsquo;s denser cloud strata, predators get larger and more piscine, capturing prey with vampiric tentacles, magical fields, or acid-coated web nets. Many upper-layer creatures drop their gas-filled eggs through these layers into even deeper strata, where the eggs eventually reach neutral buoyancy and gestate in the increased heat and pressure, away from their usual predators.<br /><br />Through this gaseous wilderness float the Dreamers, Liavara&rsquo;s most prominent&mdash;and most confusing&mdash;intelligent race. Nearly identical to the gelatinous barathus of neighboring @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}, Liavara&rsquo;s Dreamers lack their kindred&rsquo;s collectivist culture or ability to combine consciousnesses, instead swooping through the skies in complex social interactions still mostly unintelligible to outsiders. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.RXNBF1w6yXaB8P9O]{Barathu} legend says that the Dreamers were originally colonists from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda} who flew to the thenuninhabited world, only to quickly devolve&mdash;or ascend&mdash;into a state described alternately as feral or enlightened. With little interest in outside cultures and none at all in economics or governance, the Dreamers are best known for their prophetic songs predicting some great or terrible event to come&mdash;the Dreamers themselves make no distinction between the two.<br /><br />Given this relative lack of civilization, Liavara would have long since been taken over by other races if not for the barathus&rsquo; fierce insistence that the planet be left as a refuge for these pseudoholy entities. Not officially a member of the Pact&mdash;though many of its moons are&mdash;Liavara is technically a protectorate administrated exclusively by </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda}</span>, which keeps a careful watch on the humanoid gas-mining ventures and floating city-platforms allowed to operate here. While most of the gases making up the planet are ordinary elements such as hydrogen and helium, the planet also harbors many rare gases, such as metasterium (useful in a variety of genetic engineering and mutation processes) and the magic-enhancing thaumogen, popular as both a magical crafting agent and a performance enhancing drug for technomancers (but highly illegal due to its sanity-eroding side effects). Many speculators believe that there are still far more unique, valuable compounds and organisms drifting in the deep layers of the planet, and despite the hazardous conditions and strict prohibitions by Brethedan overseers, many corporations still quietly contract out for deep dive explorations, made all the more risky by the need for absolute secrecy.<br /><br />Far more welcoming than Liavara itself are the planet&rsquo;s independent moons. The most prominent of these is heavily populated Arkanen, which constantly bleeds off its atmosphere, only to replenish it each year when its eccentric orbit takes it through Liavara&rsquo;s own upper atmosphere. Extremely dangerous storms arise as huge lightning bolts arc between the two worlds, harnessed by resident scientists and spellcasters alike. This orbit should be impossible according to normal physical models, which leads many to believe that the moon was built specifically as a power source. What the arcane dynamo might have been designed to power remains unknown.<br /><br />After Arkanen, the most civilized moon is Osoro, a world of mountaintop settlements high above the seas of poisonous gas breathed out by the moon&rsquo;s jungles. Here, solar-powered gliders sail between inhabited areas, while corrosion-resistant vessels dive down into the roiling clouds to study the ruins of a lost age. Heavily populated Nchak is close behind; a world of arthropods ruled by pulsating philosopher worms and the mortal incarnation of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.uBNlQguFvGTFLHSA]{Hylax}, it has become a religious and tourist mecca for many shirrens. Less visited is Melos, a mysterious world whose entire population vanished in what may have been a rapturous religious ascendance or a more sinister event, though it remains a treasure trove for archaeologists and salvagers. Isolated Hallas has been kept carefully cordoned off since even before the Gap, lest unprepared contact with the resident hyperevolved energy beings cause outsiders&rsquo; brains to explode from overstimulation.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Liavara</h2>\n<p>Dreamer, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"qRyqEWrhbMpdsY0v\"> Keji Swarm</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"tnwoxVsO6UtVq0fH\"> Kriegakos</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.alien-archives\" data-id=\"W7k28lNRMmtO1FmL\"> Rauzhant</a></p>"}

Urgathoa&rsquo;s existence is a corruption of the natural order; some say her first divine footprints upon the soil of the Material Plane birthed plague and infection and that the first undead shadows and wraiths were born of her breath.<br /><br />Urgathoa is an utterly amoral, hedonistic goddess, concerned only with sating her own desires, regardless of the consequences others might suffer. To the Pallid Princess, the dull existence of a dead soul is pointless and tedious compared to the vibrant intensity of mortal or undead sensation, so her followers indulge in gluttonous depravity, attempting to cram as much sensation into existence as possible. Urgathoa&rsquo;s faith embraces breaking and surpassing taboos, so nothing is forbidden. Asceticism and self-restraint are repugnant&mdash;unless they are themselves part of some obsessive and gluttonous game&mdash;and the unrestrained excess of undeath is a state to aspire to.<br /><br />Creatures of passion and vice who believe that the universe is their playground are drawn to Urgathoa&rsquo;s church, as are those who worship death and revere disease. Most of her followers are insatiable gluttons, sinister necromancers, undead creatures, or those who seek undeath for themselves. They demand experience without limits or repercussions and perpetually chase hedonistic sensation. Although the church of Urgathoa is primarily interested in undeath, some cults focus on her gluttonous aspect, indulging in lavish orgies and decadent feasts of food and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}. The vices of those who worship Urgathoa tend to become ever stranger and more demanding as they advance in her service. Urgathoa&rsquo;s faith is shunned, if not outright banned, on most civilized worlds, but the undead inhabitants of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox} openly worship the Pallid Princess, and many cities have secret clubs dedicated to her, often servicing the bored elite. Urgathoa&rsquo;s temples are built like feast halls, usually adjacent to a graveyard or crypt inhabited by loyal undead creatures.<br /><br />Priests of Urgathoa are usually mystics or envoys, but people of all talents can be seduced by her promises. Interestingly, her faithful are split on the issue of technological life extension: while some eagerly pursue virtual immortality through methods like consciousness uploads, traditionalists fear that this sidestepping of magical undeath may gradually lessen the goddess&rsquo;s influence. Others see it as a nonissue, expecting it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VQrVznzrr85I90TI]{Pharasma} and her minions forcibly close such loopholes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"anZKSsgV81lZ49ew"}

Science can explain all of these and more, but the magnificence of the cosmos knows no bounds, and there are always new miracles and mysteries waiting to be discovered, explored, and explained. Ibra itself is one of these cosmic enigmas. It has no gender or defined physical form, and it&rsquo;s unclear whether Ibra is a deity who sprang into being when the universe was born, some alien paragon who ascended to godhood, or a personification of the cosmos itself.<br /><br />Ibra&rsquo;s followers believe that one can find truth, serenity, and meaning in the beauty of the cosmos, but it is up to the individual to decipher the universe&rsquo;s secrets to find these rewards. It is not Ibra&rsquo;s place to reveal the answers to creation&rsquo;s great questions, and the Inscrutable rewards those who push the boundaries of knowledge and science to explore the universe and bring its wonders to light. In Ibra&rsquo;s worldview, there is no law or chaos, no good or evil: only the questions raised by the shining light of a newborn star, the beautiful dance of heavenly bodies, and the perfect solitude of the comet as it hurtles through the dark, regardless of whether the answers to those questions are ever found.<br /><br />Astronomers, astrophysicists, cosmologists, mathematicians, and interstellar explorers worship Ibra as their patron, and many @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystic} and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarian} serve as the Inscrutable&rsquo;s priests. Ibra&rsquo;s temples are most frequently found in space rather than planetside, and they always include observatories where worshipers may study the cosmos and record their observations and hypotheses, some even directly exposed to vacuum. No one in the Pact Worlds knows what species first venerated Ibra as a god, as the oldest discovered monuments to the deity have all been massive temple complexes on otherwise uninhabited worlds, including @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda's} tiny moon Chamari.<br /><br />Ibra&rsquo;s holy symbol is as inscrutable as the god itself. Found on the oldest temples, the golden shape is often assumed to be an eye, a compass, or perhaps a planet, with an arrow leading the faithful ever onward into the unknown. More obvious is the sixstar constellation inside the symbol, yet questions abound there as well. What is the constellation&mdash;a configuration unrecognizable from any known world&mdash;and what does it mark? What is the significance of the symbol&rsquo;s tiny, lesser stars? Some Ibran priests devote their lives to exploring new worlds in search of matching the viewpoint, and a popular rumor claims the constellation is only visible from Golarion, with the symbol the key to finding it.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

Once a minor nautical deity revered on Golarion, Besmara is now venerated as a powerful goddess of pirates, conflict, and the alien leviathans that swim through the void. Some of her priests claim that Besmara took her current power and position as her prize when she deposed another deity in a daring raid, but as these events ostensibly took place during the Gap, they remain impossible to confirm. Besmara&rsquo;s ship, the <em>Starwraith</em>, sails through space and across the planes. Loyally crewed by sly and fearless pirates and spacers from countless worlds, the Starwraith shares a name with a constellation in the skies of the Pact Worlds, and many believe the two are actually one and the same.<br /><br />Besmara is brash, fickle, greedy, and lusty, but she follows her own code of honor and is loyal to her crew and allies as long as they remain useful and serve her interests. She scorns laws and civilization for the freedom and fortune of outer space, delighting only in battle, plunder, risk, and the thrill of the chase. Besmara does not concern herself with good or evil, but she disdains acts like senseless murder that bring no profit or reward. She revels in strife and trickery, and she believes that if she wants a thing someone else owns, it&rsquo;s only fair for her to take it.<br /><br />Many <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.races\" data-id=\"7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u\"> Vesk</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.themes\" data-id=\"in3kIU1U7JjTuCJ4\"> Mercenaries</a> worship Besmara in her role as the goddess of strife, but pirates, smugglers, war profiteers, and other criminals who profit from conflict make up the bulk of Besmara&rsquo;s followers. Even those pirates who normally eschew religion might still pray to Besmara to ward away her wrath, or they might toss a share of plunder out the airlock as tribute to the Pirate Queen to curry her favor. Such folk tend to be more superstitious than religious, however, so Besmara has few temples and little in the way of an organized church. Nevertheless, ports and space stations visited regularly by pirates often host small shrines to the goddess; similar altars can also be found on remote asteroids, on space hulks, and in starship graveyards.<br /><br />Most of the Free Captains (see page 476) pay at least lip service to Besmara, and many of them carry a small, valuable trinket (such as a chunk of rare mineral or an antique laser pistol stolen from an important starship captain) with them at all times, considering it bad luck to ever misplace the item. Some of these baubles have been passed down from Free Captain to Free Captain over the decades.</span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"cO4BD8W8nUCLjvSE"}

Though this caste system is now seen as archaic, with most @Compendium[sfrpg.races.nyQVqNvwCFL2YVO7]{Verthani} augmenting themselves to one degree or another and paying only lip service (at best) to the old ways, many still credit the caste system with the head start that placed Verces at the cutting edge of implant technology.<br /><br />In addition to pioneering cybernetics, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.nyQVqNvwCFL2YVO7]{Verthani} were also one of the first races to adopt space exploration, voyaging between worlds in their dirigible-like aetherships. While the coming of Drift technology and increased interplanetary trade under the Pact have allowed other worlds to catch up, verthani pilots and interstellar explorers remain legendary, and their massive shipyards at Skydock&mdash;an ancient geosynchronous satellite reached via space elevator&mdash;are second to none. Long since replaced by more modern designs, retrofitted aethership pleasure yachts still serve as marks of style and status among Pact World elites, as do their high-end Terminator-brand racing skiffs.<br /><br />Since even before the Gap, the Ring of Nations has governed Verces&rsquo;s temperate zone. While all of the component countries maintain theoretical independence, in practice the coalition forms a single worldwide government, with representatives from each country participating in the planetary Grand Assembly. The success of this model led to the Pact Worlds adopting both its structure and the peacekeeping Stewards, and to this day Verces remains a firm supporter of the agreement, as well as @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station's} closest ally. Citizens of the Ring of Nations freely pass between countries, and in places the Ring becomes a single vast city, skyscrapers glinting in the sun while its hive of shadowed lower levels blaze with neon and magic.<br /><br />Of course, not all Vercites recognize the Grand Assembly&rsquo;s authority. Beyond the terminator zone live scattered groups of rebels, from nomadic tribes and survivalist cults to criminal organizations and political exiles. Collectively termed the Outlaw Kingdoms, these fringe societies are generally ignored except when they raid Ring citizens or Ring-owned outposts, such as the vast Sun Farm solar plantations in Fullbright or Darkside&rsquo;s shelynium ice mines. Some groups, such as the ice-obsessed Ascetics of Nar in the frozen monastery called the Fastness of the Ordered Mind, trade regularly with Ring citizens, but most respectable Vercites steer clear of both darksiders and lightsiders&mdash;at least officially.<br /><br />For a planet so urban and densely settled along the terminator, Verces has a surprising amount of unexplored wilderness. Even those in the Outlaw Kingdoms, dwelling in their sun-baked huts or tunneling deep into the ice to reach the fertile seas beneath, inhabit only a tiny portion of their territory, leaving vast stretches of untouched wilds and strange ruins from unremembered eras. One of the strangest of these is Qidel, Aerie of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.PrA66Lezqc5yx4uM]{The Sun}, a strange tube-spire rising high out of the center of Fullbright and descending deep into the planet&rsquo;s mantle. So far, all expeditions into the structure have failed to return, transmitting only strange ravings about winged creatures in the depths.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Verces</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.MjO5gIWQAbjsVCGp]{Bloodbrother}, Glacial Borer, Ihonva, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.fCBM4eTpMwJNPr4J]{Niaq}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.oYtsrRPplxH4Zl34]{Verthani Aether Pilot}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.vHkWZbvEzuJRnJGp]{Verthani Pure One}</p>"}

Since the system&rsquo;s formation, the so-called Red Planet has lost much of the atmosphere and liquid water it once held due to the slowing of its liquid-iron core and the resulting weakening of its magnetosphere. Though this slow decline transpires on a geologic scale and Akiton remains hospitable to humanoid life&mdash;and indeed, its slowly expanding deserts and rock chasms are all that most of its resident species have ever known&mdash;it also offers a sad metaphor for the planet&rsquo;s dying economy.<br /><br />Prior to the discovery of hyperspace, Akiton was the center of its solar system&rsquo;s mining, production, and trade of thasteron, an ore instrumental in the creation of fuel for sublight interplanetary travel. Since the advent of Drift travel and a reduced need for long realspace flights, however, demand for thasteron has fallen, and the economic effects of the crash now play out in political squabbles and civil strife across the planet. Massive space barges that once shuttled ore between all the Pact Worlds now lie as rusting hulks in the middle of the deserts, empty save for squatters and scavengers, humanoid and otherwise. Residents whose ancestors were magnates and high-society debutantes now hunt trash-eating khefaks and dodge flying, tusk-winged norkasa in the shells of abandoned cities, toil as laborers in the few remaining mines or industrial trench-squats, or join the anarchic gangs who battle for territory on the open plains with the planet&rsquo;s more traditional nomadic peoples.<br /><br />Akiton today has no centralized government, and its cold deserts, dry seabeds, and frigid polar ice caps host neverending skirmishes and proxy wars between various cities, clans, corporations, tribes, and offworld factions. It&rsquo;s a world where unscrupulous business interests can engage in unregulated or morally questionable research and exploitation and where criminals, fugitives, and the lost come to escape justice, hide from their enemies, or try to make a fresh start.<br /><br />The planet&rsquo;s best-known urban centers are ancient cities such as Arl, with its passion for blood sports; Daza, the half-irradiated City of Fusion; and Maro with its fabled Thousand Lights, a vast trench city climbing its way up the walls of the Edaio Rift. In these dusty and flickering metropolises, Akiton&rsquo;s dreams of civilization and culture still remain&mdash;for the rich, at least&mdash;propped up by their remaining wealth and control of the planet&rsquo;s last few viable thasteron mines, as well as lucrative contracts with offworld corporations and factories specializing in weapons, armor, and ship parts. Most of Akiton&rsquo;s lesser settlements, by contrast, are company towns, squalid slums, or frontier homesteader outposts where life is cheap, harsh, and short.<br /><br />Members of nearly all of the Pact Worlds&rsquo; common races can be found somewhere on Akiton&mdash;including a seemingly native crimson-skinned @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} ethnicity&mdash;yet the best known indigenous residents are the </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}</span>.

Though operating largely off the grid, these latter nomadic populations inevitably return to the Hivemarket, the vast bazaar-city at the foot of Ka, Pillar of the Sky, where everything can be found for the right price and ghostly creatures called khulan keep the peace.

Once driven nearly to annihilation by corporate interests, the four-armed humanoid giants called @Compendium[sfrpg.races.tuLiDThwfB0yIFAH]{Shobhads} have seen a dramatic resurgence in recent years as their traditional desert life sidestepped the economic collapse.

From here, the Pact Council and its legion of delegates from all recognized Pact Worlds control the fragile alliance keeping harmony in the system, while also regulating property claims on newly discovered worlds. Here as well are the headquarters of the interplanetary law-enforcement officers called Stewards, AbadarCorp&rsquo;s home offices (at least on the Material Plane), the Archives of the galaxy-exploring Starfinders, and more. Yet the most important feature of the space station is not its grand and mysterious architecture, nor its myriad residents, but the strange artifact locked deep within the station&rsquo;s heavily guarded core: the fabled <em>Starstone</em>. For reasons unknown even to priests of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}, the <em>Starstone</em> not only powers the station but acts as an immensely powerful hyperspace beacon, allowing ships to jump quickly to the space around it no matter the distance and making Absalom Station a natural relay point for voyages returning from beyond the solar system.<br /><br />No one knows who built the vast space platform or when it entered Golarion&rsquo;s orbit, though the name hearkens back to that world&rsquo;s pre-Gap history. Artificial gravity creates a consistent &ldquo;down&rdquo; in most of the station&rsquo;s radial arms and soaring towers, and aside from individual neighborhoods retrofitted to accommodate the environmental needs of resident aliens, most of the station seems designed to cater to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} comfort. Otherwise, neighboring districts often have shockingly different cultures and living conditions, from Sparks&rsquo; hardscrabble engineering bays and the flooded tank-warrens of Puddles to the rowdy spacer bars of Drifter&rsquo;s End and the elegant, self-contained corporate enclaves in Bluerise Tower. As a general rule, money and power flow inward from the numerous bustling docks toward the great parklike dome known as the Eye, while the downtrodden masses sink down into the machine-cramped access warrens of the Spike. Gangs rule lower-class neighborhoods such as Botscrap, Downlow, and Pipetown, yet their tentative alliances filter all the way into the upper reaches of government via the station&rsquo;s Syndicsguild, the legislative body that gives each neighborhood a voice in station policy and elects the station&rsquo;s ruling Prime Executive (or Primex).<br /><br />In addition to the platform itself, Absalom Station is surrounded by a constantly changing swarm of undocked ships, both transient and resident. These latter are somewhat mockingly called the Armada, yet most are not military&mdash;the station has only a modest security fleet, depending instead on the Stewards and robust station-mounted defenses for its safety. Rather, the Armada is comprised of those starships whose owners seek the benefits of living near Absalom Station while remaining unbound by all but the most basic station laws. Absalom Station&rsquo;s generally permissive government allows this, since the volume of trade pouring through its corridors means even the lowest taxes suffice to keep the station flush.<br /><br />This is not to say the station runs in perfect harmony. With so many different interests on and around the platform, Absalom Station is never more than one slip away from chaos. Private security contractors wage shadow wars with street gangs and militant cults, alien ambassadors negotiate tense trade agreements, and explorers blast each other over claims on newly discovered worlds. One of the most dangerous factions to emerge of late is the Strong Absalom movement. This group believes the Starstone belongs only to the refugee races of Golarion, in compensation for their lost world, and that other races should be either taxed exorbitantly or outright forbidden from using the station as a waypoint. While the political arm of this movement officially decries the xenophobic terrorism of its fringe elements, its increasing strength poses a grave threat to a government built upon interplanetary cooperation.<br /><br />While trade, politics, and a cosmopolitan atmosphere are major draws to Absalom Station, they&rsquo;re not the only ones. The Arcanamirium trains some of the best technomancers in the solar system, while the station&rsquo;s famed Cosmonastery teaches the solarian&rsquo;s path. Religious organizations seek converts, the Eyeswide Agency hires out psychic investigators, the Starfinder Society launches expeditions into the unknown, and more. This endless bustle marks Absalom Station as a land of opportunity&mdash;a chance for people of all sorts to make a fresh start.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Absalom Station</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.K9j2qI3vSHyBDTaw]{Nuar Enforcer}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.VAP4WgYWhIVjrZ95]{Nuar Specialist}</p>"}

When the species of the Pact Worlds first ventured into space, Eloritu&rsquo;s worship was already well-established, with early explorers encountering his faith simultaneously in several different unconnected cultures. Eloritu&rsquo;s church teaches that he hails from a place called Gemmenad, but whether that is a planet, a star system, or some extraplanar realm in the Great Beyond is unknown. Some believe that since the Gap and the fate of Golarion rank among the greatest secrets of the universe, Eloritu must have had something to do with both, but if so, that is just one more secret that the god keeps carefully hidden.<br /><br />Eloritu teaches that while science and technology can do wondrous things, they are constrained by the laws of physics. Only magic can supersede those restraints, and those who employ magic to bend and exploit the natural laws of the universe possess a power that others can only dream of. This does not mean that Eloritu is opposed to technology. On the contrary, both magic and technology are tools that mortal races can use to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But while technology is generally designed to be as intuitive and user friendly as possible, magical practices are often deliberately obscure, requiring dedication, training, and a mastery of secrets that have been passed down for untold generations. Eloritu believes that history is both the story of the past and a guide to the future, and he teaches that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, many @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.bItuvukGHbObTApr]{Mystics} and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} worship Eloritu as the god of magic, along with historians, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.pHkB3pmyCsl3GOyp]{Xenoarchaeologists} who seek an understanding of the past. Many of Eloritu&rsquo;s priests and followers are Starfinders, as their work always holds the promise of uncovering new secrets. Eloritu&rsquo;s temples host academies of magical learning and research, but they are often concealed or veiled in some way, requiring those who want to study the ways of the Hidden Truth to work to discover the knowledge they seek.<br /><br />One of Eloritu&rsquo;s most obvious mysteries is that of his holy symbol: a ring of six strange magical runes. While the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} had utilized one of the runes for millennia in their magic, it wasn&rsquo;t until the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} arrived with knowledge of one of the others that it became clear that some greater game was afoot. Today, the Pact Worlds have managed to identify four of Eloritu&rsquo;s six sacred runes, all related to magical traditions of different races. What strange cultures might understand the remaining two&mdash;or what secrets combining all six might reveal&mdash;remains anyone&rsquo;s guess.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

While these economic ties mean lashunta nationalism rarely leads to outright warfare anymore, rampant industrial espionage and corporate influence over public policy present growing concerns for residents.<br /><br />Of the city-states still capable of going toe-to-toe with corporate power, the most significant is Qabarat, the Shining Jewel of the Western Sea and the planet&rsquo;s largest spaceport. From the city&rsquo;s Threefold House, Lady Morana Kesh and her chief consort, Grantaeus, pull a delicate web of strings to keep the planet from becoming a corporate free-for-all. Also notable for their power and influence are the city&rsquo;s many universities, renowned for their vast pre-Gap archives; they train some of the best explorers, researchers, and starship navigators in the system. Architecturally, the city is a work of art, its ancient walls of crushed and glittering shells blending seamlessly with modern additions. This sense of timelessness&mdash;of connection with the planet&rsquo;s long history&mdash;is a matter of pride to many of the residents, who exult in the sounds of soldiers training in the Battle Yards, scholars arguing good-naturedly on university steps, or the roar and hiss of the landing starships that have largely replaced water-going vessels in Ship&rsquo;s End. While most visitors to the planet enter through Qabarat&rsquo;s port, numerous portals throughout the city connect it closely with other powerful lashunta settlements, such as isolated Laubu Mesa, Komena in the Floating Shards, Jabask the Unbroken, or Candares, with its endless waterfalls and dangerous cliffside corpsicum excavations.<br /><br />Though the insectile @Compendium[sfrpg.races.pOnYi1vHP3bWMoWd]{Formians} battled with @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} for millennia, the coming of the Pact and careful shirren-brokered peace talks finally ended hostilities a mere 30 years ago. Today, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.pOnYi1vHP3bWMoWd]{Formian} hives known as the Colonies work together to farm the land and trade with other races, with each individual hive queen paying tribute to the Overqueen&mdash;a purely philosophical entity established during the historic Meeting of Queens. Each of the largest formian hive-burrows can cover miles, sometimes bulging up in artificial honeycombed hills, making them confusing to visit (and historically impossible to conquer).<br /><br />At odds with this new era of peace, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves} of Sovyrian are predominantly xenophobic traditionalists, trading with outsiders only when necessary. Members of other races are rarely allowed to settle permanently on the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elven} continent and are largely barred from even entering El, Sovyrian&rsquo;s canal-choked capital city led by neighborhood-sized Great Houses. This border control is regularly violated by the city&rsquo;s own ruling elite, however, as they hire foreigners for secretive or specialized tasks.<br /><br />The abundance of seemingly untouched wilderness on Castrovel often confuses newcomers used to cutting-edge lashunta technology, yet to most of the world&rsquo;s residents, these vast ecological preserves are proof of their enlightened society. To them, maintaining wilderness is key to advancing knowledge and allowing the same evolution that brought them sentience to continue uplifting others, and the planet&rsquo;s abundant natural resources must be harvested sustainably for the good of all. Toward this end, both the planet&rsquo;s primary shipyards and its most destructive heavy industries are relegated to Elindrae, the planet&rsquo;s airless, rocky moon. Of course, various species of dangerous megafauna&mdash;from bug-eyed mountain eels to poison-beaked sky fishers&mdash;still regularly attack settlements on Castrovel, which leads to occasionally &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; burning of protected natural regions in rural areas, but a strong Xenowarden presence usually keeps such activities from getting out of hand.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Castrovel</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.SGKDx0BEDsH4Kwoa]{Nyssholora, Adult}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.CQdmqDQU3pneJwru]{Feral Shotalashu}, Formian Myrmarch, Formian Queen, Formian Taskmaster, Formian Warrior, Formian Worker, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qwK8gQXTEKP3WpZ5]{Nyssholora, Juvenile}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.sMH15qwopmk3Jeiz]{Kaukariki}, Mountain Eel, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.FNcgeQQwTzapzs87]{Shotalashu}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.GNuUufi0H5BsSvZl]{Sky Fisher},@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.zXlsCO4XtuxZoLh5]{Tashtari}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.l0QXshtjvObnBCML]{Tashtari Alpha}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.qZdSijPk8K4bygyE]{Vracinea}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.7eHS7pgQUZieR9Lo]{Renkroda, Whiskered}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.Fe0IcQBtHNvpsCvx]{Yaruk}</p>"}

When it reached its destination of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and found the world too populated&mdash;and too well defended&mdash;for outright colonization, the ship took up orbit just past @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and declared itself a Pact World in its own right. Unlike Absalom Station, however, the <em>Idari </em>has not become a melting pot and remains inhabited primarily by kasathas and governed according to traditional kasathan values.<br /><br />While the <em>Idari </em>retains its massive reaction drives, these engines haven&rsquo;t fired in decades, and their power has been rerouted to aid the Crucibles, the ship&rsquo;s impressive state-run manufacturing sector. The ship&rsquo;s prevalent artificial gravity comes from the vast rotating cylinder referred to as the Drum, which makes up most of the ship&rsquo;s body. This curving landscape is home to gleaming cities, rolling parks, and glass-walled hydroponic farm-towers. Daylight is constant inside the ship&rsquo;s corridors, rerouted from solar collectors on the hull&rsquo;s sunward faces, though individuals often observe a 27-hour day broken into nine-hour work shifts. Through the center of the Drum runs the Hub, a zero-gravity transport tube with elevator spurs running down to the &ldquo;ground,&rdquo; allowing travelers to quickly access any location in the Drum, as well as the bridge, combat stations, engineering, and other areas.<br /><br />Government on the ship is handled by the traditional @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathan} Doyenate, a representative council composed of the most respected members of a variety of fields and callings. While the doyens and their close relatives act as a sort of aristocracy among kasathas, and these families tend to be known for accomplishments in certain fields, status as a doyen is never inherited but instead recognized by the people&mdash;sometimes against the prospective doyen&rsquo;s will. (The doyen of exploration, for instance, rarely appreciates being dragged back home to a desk job.) All doyens have a say in government decisions, yet their status both within the council and in general society is determined by their role&rsquo;s importance&mdash;a fact that has resulted in trouble in recent decades as roles like captain, so important during the <em>Idari&rsquo;s </em>flight, gradually lose significance.<br /><br />Idaran citizens are independent and may travel or emigrate without restriction, yet keeping the ship running requires a significant crew, and many of those who live on the <em>Idari </em>work for the government in some capacity. Idarans residing on the ship for more than a year and desiring the right to participate in the ship&rsquo;s government must accept and train for an auxiliary crew role. These roles are generally considered a formality, to be used only in the event of extreme emergency, and plenty of Idarans have professions totally unrelated to their reservist rank and training. Both professional crew members and ordinary civilians live side by side in the city-like Sectors spread throughout the Drum&mdash;dense but artistically arranged settlements designed around different themes. Travelers riding along the Hub can easily see the differences between sectors, as they pass from river-cut Almolar to temple-choked Brispex with its sharp and shimmering gables, from urban Khovi to the vat-farms of Mesacand, and so forth.<br /><br />One of the most recognizable features within the Drum is the Sholar Adat, a cathedral-like spire in Brispex stretching nearly to the Hub, which acts as a combination cemetery, library, and ancestor temple. While many kasathas use the structure to record and archive their memoirs or pay tribute to lost loved ones, the temple&rsquo;s claim to fame is the process called adat.<br /><br />When a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} dies aboard the <em>Idari</em>, the body is fed into the ship&rsquo;s recyclers to be broken down into useful components. Before this happens, however, the corpse is taken to the Sholar Adat, where robed attendants&mdash;adata&mdash;harvest a hairthin slice of the deceased&rsquo;s brain, which is then preserved and added to the temple&rsquo;s archives. Through the building&rsquo;s complex technomagical machinery, these samples can be used to kindle brief flashes of the deceased&rsquo;s memory and sometimes even to contact the departed soul with questions. While querying a soul isn&rsquo;t cheap and accessing a soul that passed less than a hundred years ago requires a warrant, many adata spend their time in stasis beds patched into the ship&rsquo;s Sensorium, untangling the blizzard of ancient memories with the goal of advancing kasathan society through ancestral wisdom.</span></p>"}

Travel between worlds in the system appears to have been regular but expensive, whether via ultra-powerful spells, the slow trudge of reaction drives, or plane-shifting engines like the infamous Kuthite shadow drives. Even so, the incredible distances between stars made attempts at travel beyond the solar system&rsquo;s edge exceptionally rare, the stuff of fools and zealots.<br /><br />Upon ascending to godhood, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}&rsquo;s first action was to send out the Signal: a miraculous, galaxy-wide broadcast containing plans for a new type of starship engine, one capable of accessing a heretofore unknown plane of reality called the Drift. No one truly knows whether @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} discovered the Drift by peering into the metaphysical code underlying reality, as it claims, or created the plane by divine fiat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Drift Physics</h1>\n<p>Despite its strange appearance, the Drift isn&rsquo;t very different from Material Plane space. The plane is mostly empty, airless, and sports no appreciable gravitational pull. The exception to this is what Drift explorers call &ldquo;planar bubbles.&rdquo; When a piece of another plane is torn away and added to the Drift, part of its essence expands the Drift&rsquo;s planar fabric, yet the rest is added whole cloth, its terrain (and any creatures or items present at the moment of theft) set floating in the Drift&rsquo;s expanse. The largest of these annexations are able to maintain localized regions in which their former planar properties remain dominant. As soon as anything is removed from these bubbles, it immediately loses these former planar qualities. Some scholars believe that over time these bubbles slowly break down, &ldquo;digested&rdquo; by the Drift, but if so, it&rsquo;s an inexplicably random process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Drift Travel</h1>\n<p>Drift travel operates via the same general principles as other forms of plane shifting, but without magic. Because distances within the Drift don&rsquo;t correspond to those on the Material Plane, it&rsquo;s possible for a ship to enter the Drift at one point, travel a short distance, and then pop back out onto the Material Plane in a vastly distant location, circumventing the space in between. In this way, ships can travel between star systems thousands of light years apart in a matter of days or weeks.<br /><br />While this has proven an enormous boon for the cultures of the Pact Worlds, and indeed civilizations across the galaxy, it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as it sounds. Navigating in the Drift is tricky for several reasons. First, the Drift has no real landmarks&mdash;while it&rsquo;s full of chunks of strange terrain and random objects pulled in from other planes, the Drift itself is a gargantuan, empty void of warping pink-and-purple light patterns and shifting matterless clouds of mysterious energy. Second, the Drift&rsquo;s growth is distributed randomly, with the distances between two points within the Drift constantly shifting as the plane expands or shrinks in particular regions. As a result, nothing stays in the same place for long, and two seemingly still objects may suddenly be thousands of perceived miles apart.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s where Drift beacons enter the picture. Created and maintained by @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune's} church, Drift beacons somehow manage to exist simultaneously on both the Material Plane and in the Drift. As a result, navigators can use the beacons&rsquo; positions and advanced mathematics to locate the correct spot to exit the Drift. This doesn&rsquo;t mean exiting precisely at a given beacon&rsquo;s location&mdash; in fact, many beacons are found adrift in space far from any desirable destination. Instead, the most important factor of Drift navigation is the density of beacons in a given region of real space, and it&rsquo;s this factor that most affects the length of time required to travel between locations, as well as whether a given destination is considered to be in Near Space or the Vast. To date, the Drift has never been used to travel beyond the galactic rim, though it&rsquo;s unclear whether this is a limit of Drift beacon technology, the plane itself, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune's} influence, or something else entirely.<br /><br />Trying to locate a particular point within the Drift, such as a specific planar bubble, is exceptionally difficult, requiring at least a successful DC 30 Piloting check to navigate (and possibly much more, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Certain magic items, divine fiat, or mysterious &ldquo;beacon codes&rdquo; provided by the Church of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} allow a ship to revisit a location. This is particularly true of Alluvion, the strange amalgam city that @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune} has publicly claimed as its divine realm. While ships regularly end up in the city by accident in the course of executing other jumps, reaching the city on purpose requires the aforementioned divine coordinate codes.<br /><br />Using the Drift to travel between places on the Material Plane still requires a certain amount of time spent traveling through the Drift, though this journey can take wildly varying amounts of time, even for the same ship. Similarly, these paths aren&rsquo;t as precise as physical trade routes. As such, two ships heading from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} to Vesk Prime might leave from near the same point and have the same transit time, yet never encounter each other in the Drift. This slight variation means that two ships can&rsquo;t exit the Drift onto exactly the same point in Material Plane space, and a ship won&rsquo;t exit directly into a solid object. On the other hand, it is also impossible for anyone to fortify and thus control specific jump points within the Drift, and those attempting to guard their planet from invasion would need to mine every inch of space around their world.<br /><br />All of this is useful for individual ships but adds complications for fleets or caravans attempting to arrive at the same time, let alone in the same formation. In these situations, multiple vessels can &ldquo;slave&rdquo; their Drift engines to one another, effectively becoming a single entity for purposes of travel time and arrival position. The downside to this &ldquo;mass Drifting&rdquo; is that it forces all of the component ships to use the lowest Drift engine rating of the group. Only a few militaries have developed specific master control vessels capable of circumventing this restriction and moving entire armadas quickly and coherently.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Planar Traits</h1>\n<p>Like every plane, the Drift has certain properties that remain consistent and distinguish it from other planes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Transitive Plane</h2>\n<p>The Drift is considered a transitive plane, meaning that mortals primarily use it for transportation. It is technically coterminous with the Material Plane, meaning that a given point on one corresponds to a point on another, yet these points are hopelessly scrambled&mdash;two points apparently a mile apart in the Drift might correspond to locations thousands of light-years apart on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">No Gravity</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">While individual planar bubbles may have their own regions of localized gravitational pull, for the most part the Drift itself has no distinguishable gravity. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Normal Time</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Time within the Drift passes at the same rate as time on the Material Plane. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Infinite And Expanding</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Although the Drift is technically finite&mdash;in much the same way as Outer Planes like the mountain of Heaven or Hell&rsquo;s many-layered pit&mdash;it&rsquo;s so vast as to be effectively infinite, and no one has ever found an edge or border of the plane. At the same time, divine investigation has shown that the Drift is still growing as it absorbs tiny pieces of other planes. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Dynamic Morphology</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">The Drift is fundamentally consistent, and objects within it follow the normal rules of Material Plane physics. Due to the plane&rsquo;s constant and random growth, objects&rsquo; positions in space are unstable: two objects floating next to each other one moment might suddenly be thousands of miles apart the next, without apparent movement. Fortunately, this random shifting rarely affects people or equipment while traveling through the Drift. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Mildly Neutral-Aligned</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Creatures of any alignment can exist within the Drift without taking any penalties. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Limited Magic</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Most magic functions normally in the Drift, except for spells or magical abilities that transport creatures or material in or out of the Drift. Thus spells or abilities such as <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.o78PjAYBWQpiHwMK]{Shadow Walk}</em> and <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.yjClpQv6CCrRE4EC]{Plane Shift}</em> simply fail to work, as do summoning spells and abilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.eIZGneIcEva2KBH6]{Aspecna}, Blinking Telelith (Starship), Drift Architech, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.N44K5spqrIUIlaAi]{Drift Leech}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.I0MAZmgTQ22jetq3]{Drift Mote}, Driftdead, Driftdead Amalgam, Driftlure, Garaggakal, Garaggakal Polymath, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.aV6DayWBbnnQOZyU]{Iridia}, Nacrea, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.5Uezw0obpI1MK8SC]{Paraforan}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.q6bXlwwgl9QPsTox]{Paraforan Fragment}, Swarming Telelith (Starship), Time Eater.</p>","_id":"nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX"}

She expects her mortal servants to exercise courtesy and receive the same in their dealings with one another. She strongly desires justice for everyone, honorable behavior from each individual, and bravery in battle, no matter the odds. Iomedae teaches that it is better to convince evildoers to lay down their arms in honorable surrender than cut them down, but she sanctions her followers to wage unyielding war against those who persist in serving evil.<br /><br />As the patron goddess of humanity, the Spirit of Golarion counts humans as the majority of her worshipers, but many vesk and kasathas are attracted to her code of honorable battle. A typical follower of Iomedae is a right-minded, hardworking person, helpful toward others and ready to accept help when it is offered. Crusaders, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.fqYiP2f9oSfcmrwC]{Envoys}, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers} all worship Iomedae, and many carry versions of the goddess&rsquo;s favored weapon, the @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.q0CQbPuIbLWlcVjU]{Longsword}, with them into battle. Her priests fight against oppression and seek to reshape the universe into a better form, by the sword if need be. Iomedae&rsquo;s church sponsors several knightly orders, most notably the Knights of Golarion (see page 478), who patrol the Pact Worlds and more distant star systems where humanity has settled, tirelessly crusading against evil in their mighty cathedralships.<br /><br />Where her followers establish outposts of her faith on other planets, moons, and larger asteroids, they construct large temples in which they can praise her name. These buildings are often fabricated in the style of old Golarion churches, with large fountains, soaring arches, and walls made to look like whitewashed stone. Despite their appearance, though, these structures don&rsquo;t lack modern technological amenities, as crusading knights will sometimes request to use them as training grounds, recuperation facilities, and temporary living spaces.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

To them, war and conquest are woven into the fabric of the universe, from plants&rsquo; and animals&rsquo; most basic conflicts to vast wars of ideology. One can choose to embrace this truth and secure a place in history with one&rsquo;s triumphs, or one can deny it and die a coward&rsquo;s death, scorned and forgotten. War requires sacrifice, however, and it is the duty of everyone in society to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to propel one&rsquo;s species&mdash;or culture, empire, kingdom, or world&mdash;to victory.<br /><br />Damoritosh is a harsh deity, with no concern for freedom or comfort. Sometimes called the Grim Commander, he demands soldier-like obedience from all who seek his blessing and pushes his followers to seek victory at all costs. Courage is an admirable trait, as is a militaristic sense of honor and oath keeping, but the will to fight and the drive to win are far more important to his adherents than such noble ideals as bravery or heroism. In their minds, the strong will always subjugate the weak, and so the best strategy is to project strength and defeat potential enemies before they can become a threat. Damoritosh is uninterested in diplomacy, as force and military prowess can win far greater rewards in a shorter amount of time, but he also encourages the acceptance of a foe&rsquo;s honorable surrender to avoid wasting lives for no additional gain.<br /><br />Damoritosh is the primary patron god of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, but the Conqueror&rsquo;s faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to @Compendium[sfrpg.themes.in3kIU1U7JjTuCJ4]{Mercenaries}, soldiers, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldiers} of all species, especially the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasathas} and the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashunta}. Many of Damoritosh&rsquo;s priests serve as mercenary commanders, military advisors, or chaplains in planetary defense forces, but others seek to live Damoritosh&rsquo;s teachings as fully as possible, conquering minor dominions for themselves as petty warlords both within the Pact Worlds and on new worlds throughout the galaxy. Often built in traditional vesk architectural styles, Damoritosh&rsquo;s temples are large bunker-like structures that can be easily fortified and defended by just a few warriors. Stockpiled with weapons and supplies, most churches can withstand a protracted siege or serve as a secure base for military operations, if necessary.<br /><br />While many other races see Damoritosh as destructive, his congregations believe that conquest is a wave moving ever onward, and there&rsquo;s no point in going back and mistreating those you&rsquo;ve already bested, provided they remain deferential. His sacred weapon, the energy-bladed @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.zd4YQsotsf3iKdys]{Doshko}, remains strongly associated with both his church and vesk warriors in general.</span></span></span></span><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","_id":"pq08s1mZZyi97PBA"}

These telltale clues lead to general acceptance of the theory that the planetoid originated somewhere beyond the system and was caught in the sun&rsquo;s orbit thousands of years before the Gap. Whether the world was guided to the system intentionally or arrived through some accident remains anyone&rsquo;s guess.<br /><br />The few existing records of visits to the planetoid in the centuries prior to the Gap describe a barren, airless surface and a warren of atmosphere-filled caverns and tunnels riddling the rock through to its core. Many of the chambers were empty, but others held ancient machines that still hummed, indestructible doors, permanently comatose and preserved creatures with a range of alien forms, and vaults of advanced technology and weapons. Though a few research teams explored Apostae before the Gap, interacting with a now-extinct race known as the ilee that dwelled inside the tunnels, no group from outside the world ever established a permanent foothold on the planetoid, which most assumed to be some sort of ancient generation ship or otherwise self-contained environment. Strangely, nothing in the records suggest that the ilee themselves had any knowledge of their origin, giving rise to the theory that they may have degenerated over millennia between the stars or else been some sort of captured or servitor race that outlived their masters.<br /><br />No one knows exactly what happened to completely kill off the ilee, but since the end of the Gap, Apostae has been primarily in the hands of several powerful houses of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow}&mdash;purple-skinned elves who reject their kindred on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and worship powerful demons. How and when the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} first came to the world is also a mystery lost to the Gap, but most believe that they fled there shortly before Golarion&rsquo;s disappearance, guided by their demonic patrons in a twisted parody of the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves'} own escape. Today, despite centuries of effort to expand their holdings and increase their meager population, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} still maintain only incomplete control of the planet-ship&rsquo;s interior, and their influence on the barren surface is mostly restricted to a single major city near one of the massive doors leading down into the rock. Even this much, however&mdash;when combined with their significant economic power&mdash;has been sufficient for them to claim Apostae as their home world and become signatories to the Pact, over the loud objections of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s @Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elves}.<br /><br />Much like the bone sages of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}, the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} houses don&rsquo;t work together as a cohesive government and assemble only to elect ambassadors as required by the Pact. Each @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} house acts independently, with most operating family-run corporations that deal primarily in arms, especially new technologies discovered or retroengineered from the alien items recovered by archaeo-salvage teams within Apostae. The orcs, half-orcs, and other races that live in the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow}-controlled settlements are at best second-class citizens, with no say in political matters, mostly used as laborers or subterranean cannon fodder when teams break into previously sealed chambers in search of the fabled Armory or Chamber of Life.<br /><br />The most powerful house on Apostae is House Zeizerer, which also has the broadest and most successful network for weapon sales. House Zeizerer controls Nightarch, the largest city on the planetoid&rsquo;s surface and the only known point of entry to Apostae&rsquo;s interior, as all of the other huge doors set into the planet&rsquo;s surface are locked and have proven indestructible. As a major spaceport, the city hosts bustling markets dealing in personal and starship weaponry, mercenary squads of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} warriors, fleshwarping augmentations, and custom weapons designs.<br /><br />In addition to searching for alien technology within the planet&rsquo;s vaults&mdash;either on official contract or by slipping past @Compendium[sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} defenses&mdash;visitors often come to Nightarch to study the eponymous arch at the center of the city. This arch is similar to those that link many of the system&rsquo;s worlds&mdash;and a functioning ring of such portals within the city provides access to most of the other Pact Worlds&mdash;yet this particular arch is covered in markings that have so far defied all efforts at analysis. When it activates, spontaneously and at rare and random intervals, it creates a gate to unknown landscapes. So far, no group that&rsquo;s passed through these short-lived portals has ever returned.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Apostae</h2>\n<p>Drow Enforcer, Drow Noble Arms Dealer, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.prN06env6YVPdXNp]{Orc Technician}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.PeUZujaKNfCzi0B7]{Orc Trooper}</p>"}

Yaraesa is the goddess of this struggle&mdash;the constant endeavor to develop one&rsquo;s mind and reach a state of intellectual and spiritual perfection. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas} attribute many of their race&rsquo;s early scientific advancements to Yaraesa, claiming that she was once a living scientist who learned everything that could be learned on the mortal plane. In mastering her own mind, she ascended to godhood to study all the wisdom and lore of the Great Beyond.<br /><br />Yaraesa&rsquo;s followers seek to emulate their goddess, hoping to eventually transcend their mortal forms. The path one takes toward this perfection is an individual choice&mdash;education, physical exercise, scientific scholarship, and spiritual meditation are all valid enterprises. The simple act of reading&mdash;whether on a computer screen, an actual printed volume, or direct eye-projection&mdash;can be an act of homage to Yaraesa, and each piece of knowledge or insight gained brings one a step closer to the goddess. Yaraesa bridges the divide between science and spirituality, teaching that the more you learn about the underlying laws of the universe, the more you understand about yourself.<br /><br />A majority of Yaraesa&rsquo;s worshipers and priests are @Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas}, but her faith is popular throughout the Pact Worlds, particularly among @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens}. Educators, @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.HNCQFSPw4DVTATHv]{Mechanics}, psychics, scientists, scholars, and @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} venerate the Lady of Wisdom as they explore the boundaries of both mortal knowledge and their own minds. Yaraesa&rsquo;s temples resemble ancient libraries filled with books&mdash;even if the volumes on display are just holographic props&mdash;and always include small, quiet rooms where worshipers can read or meditate in peace. Many universities, especially those on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} or funded by </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashuntas}</span>, contain chapels to Yaraesa.<br /><br />One unusual quirk of Yaraesa&rsquo;s worshipers is their vocal rejection of faith&mdash;or rather, some conventional understandings of it. Yaraesa teaches that the scientific process and knowledge gained through controlled, replicable, and verifiable experiments are the best way to understand the universe. Where some gods offer knowledge and power as a reward for allegiance, Yaraesa demands that her people figure things out for themselves as best they can. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that she refuses to grant her followers magical power; rather, she generally does so in consistent and predictable ways that can be taught like a science, and she&rsquo;s more likely to nudge someone toward a discovery than hand them the answer. For members of her church, faith isn&rsquo;t blind trust but a healthy and skeptical relationship between an esteemed teacher and her pupils.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}

This cycle takes 317 Pact Standard years, with whole generations living and dying in a single season and plant and animal life forming two nearly separate ecologies, each going dormant during its off season. Of the creatures that adapt to both, the most prominent are the humanoid @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians}, who manifest thick white fur and narrowed eyes to protect against snow blindness in the winter and develop smooth, dark skin in the summer. While the advent of spaceflight has made such adaptations less important for survival, @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorian} biology continues to be inexplicably tied to the planet, which is currently locked in winter. Those @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians} born offworld generally maintain their current winterborn form, though even without knowing the exact mechanism, some have begun using magic and genetic engineering to transition early.<br /><br />Much of traditional Triaxian culture revolves around the fraught relationship between humanoids and dragons. For millennia, the fractious humanoid nations of the Allied Territories battled against the dragon-ruled nations of the Drakelands. The tactically crucial isthmus between the two warring continents was the Skyfire Mandate, defended on the allied side by a legion of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.gNEpnjopGmc2veyT]{Ryphorians} bonded with intelligent dragonkin mounts. With the coming of the Pact, however, the primarily evil dragons of the Drakelands saw the advantages of membership and trade with the other Pact Worlds, and active hostilities ceased. Today, while humanoids remain second-class citizens in the Drakelands, their masters have opted for more subtle power plays, with many dragons acting as shadowy investors in major corporations. The Allied Nations, meanwhile, largely lost their reason for cohesion, and today nations such as militant Kamora, where every citizen goes armed, vie for relevance with countries such as Zo, where spaceflight and its support are practically a state religion, or Preita, the Scholar&rsquo;s Paradise, where @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.IvLuq2pxKkHJJpae]{Technomancers} duel on campuses for high-paying corporate contracts. While most of the nations have prospered under the new interplanetary arrangement, a few have refused to modernize fully and still cling to the old ways. Of these, the best known is the pugnacious walled city of Aylok, which shoots down any starship that dares enter its airspace and requires that anyone seeking to trade or meet with its ruling Imperators come in by land instead, through trap-lined plains of jagged ice and hordes of furred insectile horrors bred for defense. Such policies have deeply undercut the city&rsquo;s health and economy, but so far the ruling elite claims it&rsquo;s the only way to avoid complete cultural annihilation by the encroaching Pact Worlds.<br /><br />Even with minor outliers like Aylok, nowhere did the advent of the Pact have a greater effect than in the Skyfire Mandate. With peace&mdash;if a tense one&mdash;between dragons and humanoids, and with spaceflight replacing planetary combat in importance, the territory&rsquo;s famed Dragon Legion found itself without a purpose. In response, its leaders took to the stars, and today the rebranded Skyfire Legion forms an elite and highly principled mercenary organization, selling its protection to well-meaning colonists and corporations operating beyond the solar system (and thus outside the Stewards&rsquo; protection). Now the dragonkin themselves are only occasionally ridden in atmosphere. Many starfaring dragonkin families have resorted to genetic engineering to reduce their size to better fit in the narrow corridors of space stations and starships, and thanks to their near-telepathic bond with their partners, no humanoid of the legion would dream of flying a starfighter without her dragonkin copilot.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\">Outside of the Allied Territories, a notable exception to prevailing Triaxian culture is the continent of Ning, long cut off from the other nations by the vast Sephorian Sea. Like backward-looking Aylok, Ning has refused to acknowledge the Pact&rsquo;s authority, but it has embraced modernization, making it a haven for corporations, criminals, and all others that seek to avoid Pact control. Far from being a lawless society, however, Ning is obsessed with honor and status&mdash;traits that attract a fair number of @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} immigrants&mdash;and its upper class, led by the Immortal Suzerain, keeps its citizens safe from dangers both domestic and foreign. Culturally, Ning is best known for the <em>ukara</em>, or &ldquo;battleflowers&rdquo;: lithe, genderless warriors&mdash;often @Compendium[sfrpg.classes.kuEdVbzv5zXIO4wk]{Solarians}&mdash;who compete in broadcasted ritual combat in exchange for system-wide celebrity.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListSystems_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>Aliens Found At Triaxus</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.HRrlAqsy8RNlu8wD]{Wolliped, Alural War Wolliped}, Dragonkin, Elmeshra, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.XFBxFNz0W1LT7ONr]{Ryphorian Skyfire Pilot}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.dip7t11VYLzcu19k]{Ryphorian Technician}, @Compendium[sfrpg.alien-archives.kTazJdDZwePBfA3l]{Wolliped}</p>"}

But when the Swarm rejected individuality for the collectivity of the hive, it abandoned Hylax as well. Hylax respected the Swarm&rsquo;s choice and resolved not to interfere with its development, turning her attention to other sentient insectile species in the galaxy, but she always hoped her children would return to her. Eventually, the Forever Queen&rsquo;s patience was rewarded when the @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirrens} broke from the Swarm&rsquo;s hive mind and became individuals once more, rediscovering their ancient patron in the process.<br /><br />Hylax knows that peace is a better state than war and that friendship is more rewarding than hostility. She teaches her followers to consistently use diplomacy in their dealings with others, to constantly strive for fellowship and harmony, and to always seek allies rather than conquest. But Hylax also realizes that sometimes diplomacy fails and that the peaceful must sometimes defend the innocent. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with failing to achieve peace&mdash;the moral imperative is simply to make the attempt, no matter how difficult or distasteful it might seem.<br /><br />The intelligent arthropods of the @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavaran} moon of Nchak have worshiped Hylax since even before the Gap, believing that their leaders are the mortal incarnations of the Forever Queen and striving to build their civilization in accordance with her teachings.

Priests of Hylax often serve on starships engaged in interstellar exploration missions, acting as first contact specialists should their crews encounter new extraterrestrial species. Hylax&rsquo;s hive-like temples may be found wherever species from different worlds mingle together, and all are welcome inside in the spirit of amity and harmony.<br /><br />Though Hylax is traditionally a god of hive creatures, she&rsquo;s paradoxically fond of individualism, and she encourages her followers to seek strength in community but recognize and embrace their individual value. Differences in doctrine and tradition among her followers are only natural, and while the Forever Queen of Nchak acts as supreme pontiff for her hive-based followers, shirrens are encouraged to have a more personal relationship with the divine.</span></p>"}

Nyarlathotep is unusual among the Outer Gods in that he enjoys personally toying with and sowing discord among mortal races, rather than leaving this to his cultists. Scholars of the Outer Gods and the Dark Tapestry&mdash;the dark voids between galaxies or mysterious patches of emptiness within a galaxy, where such beings are thought to hold the most sway&mdash;believe that Nyarlathotep himself is the prime mover in preparing countless worlds for the devastating return of the devouring Great Old Ones, nudging events along in subtle ways to encourage various apocalyptic ends. It is said that one can see Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s influence in every major disaster or calamity if one looks hard enough and that he has had a hand in guiding entire civilizations into ruin.<br /><br />Each of Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s forms is associated with its own distinct cult, but the incarnation that most Pact Worlds species are familiar with is the Empty Traveler. Ostensibly appearing as a humanoid figure in a space suit that would not be out of place in any spaceport, closer scrutiny reveals a vacant helmet devoid of any head or face and a space suit filled with a formless mass of writhing tentacles. Other well-known manifestations include the Black Pharaoh (a humanoid being with connections to the ancient pre-Gap Golarion civilization of Osirion) and the Haunter of the Dark (a bat-like entity with a burning tri-lobed eye). In any form, the Crawling Chaos works to upend the status quo and cast down the mortal races from the heights of their achievements. As the deity of conspiracies and dangerous secrets, Nyarlathotep engineers the deaths of kings, presidents, and reformers to inexorably guide civilization toward anarchy.<br /><br />Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s faithful believe he is the Outer God who ties together the worship of all the Great Old Ones, and follow him as the one who will open the doors to the uncaring light of the stars. Occult scholars, crazed cultists, and those who seek suppressed knowledge or the proscribed mysteries of forgotten magics may pay homage to the Crawling Chaos, as do serial killers, violent revolutionaries, and anyone who desires to dismantle societal systems without regard for the cost. Secret temples to Nyarlathotep are spread throughout the Pact Worlds, but the center of his worship is on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn}, home to the infamous Pyramid of the Black Pharaoh. Some even whisper that Carsai the King, the enigmatic sovereign of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Ave5caJSxVvKFVAB]{Aucturn} (see page 460), might be a herald or avatar of Nyarlathotep.</span></p>"}

He is the master and guardian of the First Vault, a vast depository in his extraplanar realm that contains an ideal version of every creature and object ever made&mdash;the perfect @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, the perfect currency, the perfect laser pistol, the perfect spell, and even the perfect law.<br /><br />Abadar rewards caution and planning, and he rejects impulsiveness. He is not a hasty deity, knowing that the expansion of civilization and law is gradual but inevitable. Only through discipline, hard work, and incisive judgment can one attain happiness and wealth. Risk is occasionally called for and can generate lucrative rewards, but only after careful planning and consideration of all known factors. Abadar favors neither good nor evil, as both sides have their benefits, but he supports employment over slavery, as paid workers can contribute their own accumulated wages to the commercial markets and thus the profitability of civilization as a whole.<br /><br />Abadar&rsquo;s most fervent worshipers are generally aristocrats, colonists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, politicians, and traders, but many poor people venerate the Master of the First Vault in hopes of attracting his attention and reversing their fortunes. The occasional artist or artisan who is devoted to Abadar strives to duplicate the perfect forms of the objects found within the god&rsquo;s realm with their own works. Followers of Abadar believe that he was responsible for elevating the sentient races of the galaxy from primitive tribes to technological civilizations, and many seek to follow his example when they encounter less advanced civilizations on newly discovered planets or when they establish new settlements and trade networks.<br /><br />Abadar&rsquo;s church, AbadarCorp (see page 473), is simultaneously a religious institution and one of the most successful and powerful corporations in the Pact Worlds. Its managers and executives serve as the church&rsquo;s priests, and the company&rsquo;s many offices, stores, trading outposts, and warehouses double as temples and can be found on almost every settled world. These structures are all built in an unmistakable and seemingly contradictory style&mdash;solid, practical construction (to protect against thieves) that is richly ornamented (to showcase the wealth that often resides within). Many of AbadarCorp&rsquo;s buildings also feature durable, translucent-ceramic windows tinted a vivid yellow to cast the interiors in a golden hue.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListDeities_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"}
