A character looking for an invisible creature might find his quarry if the invisible creature drops an item, speaks, smells strongly, leaves an obvious trail, or performs some action that makes itself known. Finding an invisible creature in this way requires a Perception check as normal. If successful, and assuming your only precise sense is vision, you become aware of the invisible creature&rsquo;s presence, but you don&rsquo;t know its exact location.

If your negative levels equal your total character level (or CR, for monsters), you die.</p>\n<p>Negative levels are temporary, unless the effect that bestows them specifies they are permanent. If you have temporary negative levels, you can attempt a saving throw each day to remove those negative levels. The DC is the same as the DC of the effect that caused the negative levels. If you have negative levels from multiple sources, you must attempt a separate saving throw to remove the negative levels from each source.</p>\n<p>If an effect imposes permanent negative levels, they are treated just like temporary negative levels, but you do not receive a saving throw each day to remove them. Permanent negative levels can be removed through spells such as @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.usqy3VusjjgEnM9N]{Restoration}. If you die, permanent negative levels remain even after you are restored to life. If your permanent negative levels equal your total number of class levels (or CR, for monsters), and you are brought back to life using spells such as @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.nffP8Mq7rJ8Rskb9]{Mystic Cure} or @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{Raise Dead}, you remain alive for 3 rounds but then die again if you have not also benefited from a <em>restoration&nbsp;</em>spell or similar effect within that time.</p>"},"enabled":true,"modifiers":[{"_id":"64189fa6-a166-47a6-88a9-5cb270c79a0f","name":"Negative Levels - Ability Checks","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"ability-checks","enabled":true,"max":-2,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""},{"_id":"4f66bccb-d573-4d4d-9d7a-fe7e65dc8a84","name":"Negative Levels - AC","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"ac","enabled":true,"max":-2,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":"both"},{"_id":"de4be9b3-946a-45d2-9f72-e8e1f6c466b5","name":"Negative Levels - Attack Rolls","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"all-attacks","enabled":true,"max":-2,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""},{"_id":"d7107e77-b05d-48fd-b7f3-8eb9094e0cc3","name":"Negative Levels - Saving Throws","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"saves","enabled":true,"max":-2,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negativ eLevels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""},{"_id":"33b97119-cd5e-4ec4-ab21-d8c56c56e6c4","name":"Negative Levels - Skill Checls","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"all-skills","enabled":true,"max":-2,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""},{"_id":"5e4d87c5-ec75-40b6-b1e9-9100c89b0127","name":"Negative Levels - HP","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"hit-points","enabled":true,"max":-10,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value*5)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""},{"_id":"a719302a-fe67-4e8f-9a6e-9c74e988bfb2","name":"Negative Levels - SP","type":"untyped","condition":"","container":{"actorId":"ruej4ADTcN5ob0R1","itemId":"k6DUDdbQfRGUpFrR"},"effectType":"stamina-points","enabled":true,"max":-10,"modifier":"-(@resources.NegativeLevels.Number.value*5)","modifierType":"constant","notes":"","source":"Negative Levels","subtab":"misc","valueAffected":""}],"range":{"max":20,"min":0,"mode":"post"},"source":"CRB pg. 252","stage":"early","subType":"Number"}}
