This memory palace has a single shimmering entrance. You can access your memory palace once per day; when you do, the entrance appears within close range. If any creatures or objects that were not part of the memory palace when it was created remain inside it, the entrance remains where it first appeared. Only those you designate can enter the memory palace, and the entrance closes and becomes invisible behind you when you enter. Anyone inside can open the entrance and exit the memory palace at will. The only way to enter and exit the memory palace is via the entrance; even <em>plane shift</em> and similar magic do not access it.<br><br>You can create any floor plan you desire for your memory palace, up to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your mystic level. Inside, the atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm; outside conditions don’t affect the memory palace, nor do conditions inside it pass beyond. There is no furniture other than bookcases, computers, and a few desks and sofas. A number of unseen servants (as per the spell of the same name) equal to half your mystic level serve as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you access it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating—you don’t need to be inside it to alter it.<br><br>When you gain this ability, choose one skill that can be used with the recall knowledge task. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within—including you—a +4 enhancement bonus to skill checks to recall knowledge of that type, and creatures inside the memory palace can attempt checks of that type untrained.

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></sub>&nbsp;Graviton

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level. <br><br>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon’s damage. <br><br>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 86px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\"><strong>Solar Weapon</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Solarian","type":"","activation":{"type":"move","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"none","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"none","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

These saving throws use the Poor Save bonus progression on the below table.</li>\n<li>Ability Scores: This shows the drone’s base ability scores. Drones have no Constitution score. Any DCs or other statistics that rely on a Constitution score treat a drone as having a Constitution score of 10 (no bonus or penalty). Drones can’t use items that grant additional ability score increases.</li>\n<li>Ability Increases: These are the drone’s ability scores that increase as you gain levels, as determined by the Ability Increase progression on the below table.</li>\n<li>Bonus Skill Unit: Some chassis come programmed with knowledge of a skill that is a part of the chassis itself. This skill is a class skill for your drone, and it gains a number of ranks in that skill equal to your mechanic level. Your drone can use this skill while not under your direct control. This skill is in addition to the skill gained via the drone’s skill unit ability (see page 76). You can’t change this skill unit when you gain levels or when you rebuild your drone unless you choose a new chassis.

The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe.

These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented on page 75.</p>\n<h2>Drone Base Statistics</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s abilities are determined by your mechanic level (or the level you assign to it through your control net ability) and the mods you select for your drone. The below table determines many of the base statistics for your drone. These base statistics modify the starting statistics determined by the drone’s chassis. The terms used in the table are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Level: This is equal to your mechanic level. If you have the control net class feature and assign fewer levels to your drone than you have, the drone’s base statistics are determined by the level you assign to it.</li>\n<li>Hit Points: This is the drone’s maximum number of Hit Points. For the purposes of spells and other effects that rely on Hit Dice or level, your drone’s equivalent Hit Dice or level is equal to your mechanic level (or the level you have assigned to it with the control net class feature). Drones do not have Stamina Points.</li>\n<li>Base Attack Bonus: This is the drone’s base attack bonus.</li>\n<li>Armor Class: Add the listed bonus and the drone’s Dexterity modifier to base Armor Class values listed for its chassis to determine the drone’s total EAC and KAC. Your drone cannot wear armor of any kind, and you cannot increase your drone’s AC further without selecting the appropriate mods.</li>\n<li>Good Save Bonus, Poor Save Bonus: These are the drone’s base saving throw bonuses. Each chassis type designates which saving throw uses the good save value and which ones use the poor save value.</li>\n<li>Ability Increase: Increase two of your drone’s ability scores, as designated by its chassis, by this amount.</li>\n<li>Feats: This is the drone’s total number of feats. You can select a drone’s feats from those listed in Drone Feats on page 76. A drone cannot select a feat that requires a base attack bonus of +1 until it gains its second feat at 3rd level.</li>\n<li>Mods: This is the number of custom modifications you can add to your drone.</li>\n<li>Special: Your drone gains these abilities when you reach (or assign via control net) the appropriate level, as noted on the table. These abilities are described in the section below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 464.8px; color: #191813; font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif;

In this case, the new condition lasts for the same duration the original condition would have and can’t be further affected by this ability.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.pCfJfn8TQKboG6ni]{Secret of the Archmagi (Su) (4th)}</h2>\n<p>You can imbue two weapons with the rune of the eldritch knight. If you attempt to imbue a third weapon, the weapon infused first loses its rune and all benefits. In addition to the normal benefits, the runes grant the weapons one or more of the following weapon fusions (see page 191) of your choice: <em>bane</em>, <em>corrosive</em>, <em>ethereal</em>, <em>flaming</em>, <em>frost</em>, <em>holy</em>, <em>merciful</em>, <em>shock</em>, <em>thundering</em>, or <em>unholy</em>. You can grant no more than 10 total levels’ worth of fusions between the two weapons, and the bane fusion counts as a 10th-level fusion for this purpose.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.mB0V4cPLp7OI9MgN]{Arcane Attack (Su) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use a weapon imbued with the rune of the eldritch knight to make an attack that strikes true. This attack ignores all cover and concealment, including total concealment (though you must at least be aware of a creature’s presence to target it with this attack). If the attack is a ranged attack, the target must be within the first range increment. The attack only affects your selected target, even if it normally affects an area or multiple targets. You still must make a normal attack roll, and if your attack misses, it has no effect.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Fighting Style","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
