You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br><br>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Biohacker","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table below). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 141px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\"><strong>Entropic Strike Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Vanguard","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, bleed (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, knockdown. You may add this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a critical hit both effects apply.

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></sub>&nbsp;Graviton

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–5: Mystic Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</span></p>\n<h2>Spells Per Day</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"height: 336px;

Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter.

You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br><br>All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br><br>You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br><br>For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.<br><br>The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by sacrificing a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li>\n<li><strong>6th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Witchwarper","type":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"none","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"none","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you. </span></p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n        <p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned.

This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n        <p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned.

This weapon appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. The shape of normal ranged weapons—such as pistols, crossbows, and handcannons are fairly common—but more esoteric manifestations such as a shimmering crystal that launches fragments of itself, a dark aura that forms directly onto your foes, or an orb of stellar energy that releases beams of pure light are also possible. Your solar flare’s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn’t give the weapon any weapon special properties. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br><br>Your solar flare functions as a one-handed uncategorized small arm that targets EAC (though it can’t be used to make trick attacks, if you have that class feature), and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar flare deals cold damage or fire damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar flare deals 1d4 damage and has a range increment of 60 feet. This damage increases by 1d4 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter.<br><br>Unlike most small arms, when you gain Weapon Specialization at 3rd level, you add your full solarian level to damage with your solar flare, as opposed to half.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it.

The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned.

First, choose the drone’s chassis, which along with your mechanic level determines its base statistics. Next, choose your drone’s special abilities and feats. Finally, select your drone’s modifications (“mods”), which grant your drone additional abilities and allow you to fully customize it.<br><br>Other than those aspects determined by your drone’s chassis and mods, the exact details of your drone’s appearance and personality are up to you.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Y4ajp13ACVnzaS5s]{Drone Chassis}</h2>\n<p>Each drone has one of three chassis types that determines its size, starting statistics, and initial mods, as well as the drone’s overall look and theme. These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented on page 75.</p>\n<h2>Drone Base Statistics</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s abilities are determined by your mechanic level (or the level you assign to it through your control net ability) and the mods you select for your drone. The below table determines many of the base statistics for your drone. These base statistics modify the starting statistics determined by the drone’s chassis. The terms used in the table are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Level: This is equal to your mechanic level. If you have the control net class feature and assign fewer levels to your drone than you have, the drone’s base statistics are determined by the level you assign to it.</li>\n<li>Hit Points: This is the drone’s maximum number of Hit Points. For the purposes of spells and other effects that rely on Hit Dice or level, your drone’s equivalent Hit Dice or level is equal to your mechanic level (or the level you have assigned to it with the control net class feature). Drones do not have Stamina Points.</li>\n<li>Base Attack Bonus: This is the drone’s base attack bonus.</li>\n<li>Armor Class: Add the listed bonus and the drone’s Dexterity modifier to base Armor Class values listed for its chassis to determine the drone’s total EAC and KAC. Your drone cannot wear armor of any kind, and you cannot increase your drone’s AC further without selecting the appropriate mods.</li>\n<li>Good Save Bonus, Poor Save Bonus: These are the drone’s base saving throw bonuses. Each chassis type designates which saving throw uses the good save value and which ones use the poor save value.</li>\n<li>Ability Increase: Increase two of your drone’s ability scores, as designated by its chassis, by this amount.</li>\n<li>Feats: This is the drone’s total number of feats. You can select a drone’s feats from those listed in Drone Feats on page 76. A drone cannot select a feat that requires a base attack bonus of +1 until it gains its second feat at 3rd level.</li>\n<li>Mods: This is the number of custom modifications you can add to your drone.</li>\n<li>Special: Your drone gains these abilities when you reach (or assign via control net) the appropriate level, as noted on the table. These abilities are described in the section below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 464.8px; color: #191813; font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif;

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.
