You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br><br>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br><br>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br><br>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br><br>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br><br>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br><br>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug} or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Biohacker","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks).

Choose from: aurora, block, breach, breakdown, bright, disarm, echo, extinguish, feint, injection, harrying, penetrating, quick reload, recall, stun, trip.<br>At 11th level, you can add a second weapon special property from that list, or you can add force as a second weapon special property. Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, knockdown. You may add this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a critical hit both effects apply. A weapon cannot have two versions of the same critical hit effect.<br>At 17th level, you can instead add the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blind}, demoralize, wound, sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon property or a critical hit effect.<br>Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can switch any of these customizations for a different customization, but you must always choose at least one customization from the 7th-level list. <br><br></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.kXG9x8sTS6B5CIDA]{Versatile Design (Su) - 10th Level}</h2>\n<p>Long hours of research and tinkering have taught you how to modify your weapon prototype on the fly. Select four weapon fusions of a level your prototype weapon qualifies for. Your weapon gains one of these fusions without it counting against the total item levels of fusions it can have. With 10 minutes of work, you can change the weapon fusion currently installed in your weapon prototype to another of your selected fusions. If a fusion selected with this ability has a limited number of uses, using it counts against the uses of any other fusion you access with this ability. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can change the four fusions you have selected. <br><br></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.yYpUKezJS6BC6aGv]{Dual Chambers (Ex) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>You modify your experimental weapon prototype to deal multiple types of damage.

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"

If the power requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Connection Spell - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;Your connection grants you additional spells known, one for each level of mystic spell you can cast, starting at 1st level and at any level when you normally gain access to a new spell level. These spells are in addition to the spells known listed on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. These spells can&rsquo;t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels (except in specific cases; see below). The spell level of each spell is listed in your connection&rsquo;s entry.<br /><br />If your connection lists a single variable-level spell (see page 330) for all spell levels at the start of its spells entry, you gain that variable-level spell when you first get your connection spell for each level. The next time you gain a connection spell, add the next higher level of the variable-level spell to your list of spells known. You immediately lose the lower-level version of that variable-level spell and replace it with the listed connection spell for that lower level.</p>\n<h2>Connections</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2N7K20WTe9aA7ivW]{Akashic}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7GS83RMzWPMDx3LT]{Crusader}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Hj7rGHmzQGP8rEGB]{Empath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.v0UEjqjIg10jkGjk]{Healer}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Z1V1TmTxPhgur7n1]{Melophile}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.6zrV67znbGCh4EjF]{Mindbreaker}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.5wf2lqWnQxuuTIU1]{Overlord}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ewIp0apLL1OKr1MF]{Star Shaman}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7NxgC9bTcFZkPXY6]{Warmonger}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.L8EnApYQIJp9EAtc]{Xenodruid}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.yXBlDiVu3PiTBexY]{Delusion}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Mystic","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/connection.png"}

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level. <br><br>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level.

This skill is a class skill for your drone, and it gains a number of ranks in that skill equal to your mechanic level. Your drone can use this skill while not under your direct control.

You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br><br>All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br><br>You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br><br>For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.<br><br>The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by sacrificing a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects.

This weapon appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. The shape of normal ranged weapons—such as pistols, crossbows, and handcannons are fairly common—but more esoteric manifestations such as a shimmering crystal that launches fragments of itself, a dark aura that forms directly onto your foes, or an orb of stellar energy that releases beams of pure light are also possible. Your solar flare’s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn’t give the weapon any weapon special properties. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br><br>Your solar flare functions as a one-handed uncategorized small arm that targets EAC (though it can’t be used to make trick attacks, if you have that class feature), and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar flare deals cold damage or fire damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar flare deals 1d4 damage and has a range increment of 60 feet. This damage increases by 1d4 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter.<br><br>Unlike most small arms, when you gain Weapon Specialization at 3rd level, you add your full solarian level to damage with your solar flare, as opposed to half. If you are a multiclass solarian, you add only your full solarian level and half your levels in other classes to damage with your solar flare.<br><br>Any solarian class features (including stellar revelations and zenith revelations) that specifically affect melee weapons (such as the flashing strikes class feature) function with your solar flare, even if they normally work only with melee attacks. Anything that specifically affects solar weapons (such as <em>solarian weapon crystals</em>) affects your solar flare in the same way, though it can’t gain any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion that can’t be applied to a small arm.<br><br>Forming or dismissing a solar flare is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar flare is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 107px; height: 336px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\"><strong>Solar Flare</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">3d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">3d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">3d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">4d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">5d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">6d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">7d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">8d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">9d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">10d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">11d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 32.4px; height: 16px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.4px; height: 16px;\">12d4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Solarian","type":"","activation":{"type":"move","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"none","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"none","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn’t need to be in your hand to function.<br><br>Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br><br>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br><br>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br><br>At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br><br>If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Biohacker","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"1st Level","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

First, choose the drone’s chassis, which along with your mechanic level determines its base statistics. Next, choose your drone’s special abilities and feats. Finally, select your drone’s modifications (“mods”), which grant your drone additional abilities and allow you to fully customize it.<br><br>Other than those aspects determined by your drone’s chassis and mods, the exact details of your drone’s appearance and personality are up to you.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Y4ajp13ACVnzaS5s]{Drone Chassis}</h2>\n<p>Each drone has one of three chassis types that determines its size, starting statistics, and initial mods, as well as the drone’s overall look and theme. These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented on page 75.</p>\n<h2>Drone Base Statistics</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s abilities are determined by your mechanic level (or the level you assign to it through your control net ability) and the mods you select for your drone. The below table determines many of the base statistics for your drone. These base statistics modify the starting statistics determined by the drone’s chassis. The terms used in the table are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Level: This is equal to your mechanic level. If you have the control net class feature and assign fewer levels to your drone than you have, the drone’s base statistics are determined by the level you assign to it.</li>\n<li>Hit Points: This is the drone’s maximum number of Hit Points. For the purposes of spells and other effects that rely on Hit Dice or level, your drone’s equivalent Hit Dice or level is equal to your mechanic level (or the level you have assigned to it with the control net class feature). Drones do not have Stamina Points.</li>\n<li>Base Attack Bonus: This is the drone’s base attack bonus.</li>\n<li>Armor Class: Add the listed bonus and the drone’s Dexterity modifier to base Armor Class values listed for its chassis to determine the drone’s total EAC and KAC. Your drone cannot wear armor of any kind, and you cannot increase your drone’s AC further without selecting the appropriate mods.</li>\n<li>Good Save Bonus, Poor Save Bonus: These are the drone’s base saving throw bonuses. Each chassis type designates which saving throw uses the good save value and which ones use the poor save value.</li>\n<li>Ability Increase: Increase two of your drone’s ability scores, as designated by its chassis, by this amount.</li>\n<li>Feats: This is the drone’s total number of feats. You can select a drone’s feats from those listed in Drone Feats on page 76. A drone cannot select a feat that requires a base attack bonus of +1 until it gains its second feat at 3rd level.</li>\n<li>Mods: This is the number of custom modifications you can add to your drone.</li>\n<li>Special: Your drone gains these abilities when you reach (or assign via control net) the appropriate level, as noted on the table. These abilities are described in the section below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; width: 464.8px; color: #191813; font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif;

This bond lasts until dispelled or until you create a new healer’s bond, which immediately ends the previous one.

You must touch the target (requiring a successful melee attack against its EAC), which deals 1d6 damage for every 2 mystic levels you have (maximum 10d6). Choose an ally within 30 feet; that ally recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt (to a maximum of the foe’s remaining Hit Points). Alternatively, you can heal yourself instead, but you restore only a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If this heals the recipient (you or your ally) up to maximum Hit Points, any excess persists for 1 hour as temporary Hit Points.

When you use healing channel as a full action, it heals all allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature within 120 feet (as well as all other allies within 30 feet).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JgygiXsLGb6tlkFq]{Channel Life (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you use healing channel on a creature that has died within 1 round, you can bring it back to life as per a 5th-level <em>mystic cure</em> spell.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NSXREp19pTNTmWTs]{Deny Death (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to death effects and negative levels.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.
