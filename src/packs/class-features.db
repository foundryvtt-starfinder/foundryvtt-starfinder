You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly—a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.</p>\n<p>You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack’s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.5bNbood0KKzBbKyv]{Mitigate (Ex)}), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.</p>\n<p>You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.</p>\n<p>A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.lgdDuAM2I3s8PQsD]{Custom Microlab (Ex)} to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they’re within your custom microlab’s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.</p>\n<p>The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don’t need to decide which specific biohacks you’re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren’t used that day become inert, even if they’re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.</p>\n<p>Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.rpaon3jF3nCe5eP9]{theorems} to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.kqK4E3QfsnbIqHtB]{secondary} and a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.fBSG6tVqpRJ6ssTe]{tertiary} field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2>Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature’s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a –2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target’s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2>Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don’t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3>Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn’t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don’t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drugs} or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drug} or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Disease}, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Disease}, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3>Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Biohacker","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}}

Only those you designate can enter the memory palace, and the entrance closes and becomes invisible behind you when you enter. Anyone inside can open the entrance and exit the memory palace at will. The only way to enter and exit the memory palace is via the entrance; even <em>plane shift</em> and similar magic do not access it.</p>\n<p>You can create any floor plan you desire for your memory palace, up to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your mystic level.

Your weapon remains imbued for 1 minute, until you imbue another weapon, or until the end of your turn if you cease wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, when you imbue your weapon, you can also choose one of the following weapon fusions: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Do0w6So0C40HqhER]{Anarchic}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Iep4sqgx3KuTe97f]{Axiomatic}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.fsu2lyuyH9LUmDyz]{Defiant}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.I2UF2A0caxvNXXgK]{Dispelling}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.9bJcypS8Yq7gt9Vk]{Charge Disrupting}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.3Z4TivImf47FA1fn]{Durable}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.5KsmBkidShbIetHD]{Holy}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.5TkhBOwRywuI1hy5]{Merciful}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.lwWMVKatML2oimTk]{Seeking}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.21qnSrGH3lk8ivBI]{Unholy}. While imbued, the weapon gains and automatically activates the chosen fusion, even if this fusion would exceed the number of fusions the weapon could normally accommodate, though the fusion must be one that could normally be applied to the weapon. At 10th level, you can also choose from the following fusions: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.tXg2Qct6wWKXvzFW]{Corrosive}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.xCFWNmEQCMP2pbBo]{Flaming}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.1dzuG0GcJFvkdHrO]{Frost}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.j5zkM0udl7baRuG1]{Ghost Killer}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.a4PQiyAL5a24oKYi]{Shock}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.IbC1GFdWsUKKseRs]{Thundering}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.78g7h7nN3gWIY4ut]{Wounding}.

Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.</p>\n<p>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks).

The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your mystic level, unless the target succeeds at a Will save to reduce the duration to just 1 round.

Only the target can see the mindkiller, and if the target succeeds at a Will save to recognize the image as unreal, the mindkiller has no effect. If the target fails this Will save, the mindkiller touches the target, which must then succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear.

Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage from the flying debris. A target with more than 20 Hit Points takes 1d6 damage per mystic level you have (maximum 20d6), but can attempt a Fortitude save to take only half damage.

A blood mark lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The blood mark is attuned to creatures of the same type as the creature you killed, destroyed, or reduced to 0 HP to gain the blood mark, and it grants you one of the following benefits of your choice: a +1 morale bonus to attacks against creatures of the attuned type, a +1 morale bonus to AC against attacks from creatures of the attuned type, a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against attacks and effects created by creatures of the attuned type, or a +1 morale bonus to damage dealt to creatures of the attuned type. You choose this benefit when you gain the blood mark, and it lasts for as long as the mark lasts.

This grants you a bonus to attack and damage rolls with basic melee weapons and small arms. The bonus to attacks is equal the level of spell slot expended – 2 (minimum +1 bonus), and the bonus to damage is equal to the level of the spell slot expended. This frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) plus the level of the spell slot expended. You can dismiss your destructive frenzy early as a free action.

This functions as the blood mark connection ability (see above), but the bonus is +2 and the subject that gains the blood mark decides which of the benefits to gain. You cannot have more than one greater blood mark active at a time, and granting a new greater blood mark ends any previous greater blood mark you had active.

This free version is of an item level no greater than your mechanic level – 2 (minimum 1st level). You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your experimental prototype. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your experimental prototype with the same amount of work, allowing you to change the type of armor or weapon you chose as a basis for your experimental prototype (selecting an item of the same type with an item level no higher than the item level of your previous prototype).</p>\n<p><strong>Experimental prototype replaces the artificial intelligence (AI) class feature.</strong></p>\n<p>You have designed and built, and are constantly upgrading, a sophisticated weapon. You begin play with one weapon with an item level of 1 for free, or you can buy any weapon normally and designated it as your weapon prototype. You design and build this weapon and, while it may be similar in aesthetics and function to an existing type of weapon, it is fundamentally unique from any mass-produced product. Due to its experimental design and custom safety features, you are the only one who can make attacks with this weapon. As you gain levels, your weapon prototype advances in sophistication. If you acquire a different weapon, you can disassemble your existing prototype and turn the new weapon into your prototype with 8 hours of work.</p>\n<p>Your weapon prototype works as normal for a weapon of its type, but it gains specific benefits based on your mechanic level, as defined below. You can have only one weapon designated as your weapon prototype at a time.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.pQayHFE3TAuHoV2V]{Weapon Prototype Proficiency (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain proficiency in advanced melee weapons, heavy weapons, or longarms. Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed. Your weapon prototype must be a weapon of this type. Your designated weapon prototype calculates its hardness, HP, and saves as if its item level were 5 higher.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.78JJBJj1yxKqmqQ4]{Superior Firepower (Ex)- 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>When you attack with your experimental weapon prototype, you can enhance its damage dealt to select foes. As a move action, you calibrate your weapon prototype to deal additional damage to one enemy you can see. You gain an insight bonus equal to your mechanic level to damage on all attacks against the designated target. Calibrating your weapon against another enemy causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous enemy.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.HDK8f8weNAkofDdt]{Improved Magazine (Ex)- 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your experimental weapon prototype can carry more ammunition than a normal weapon of its type. If it contains individual darts, petrol, rounds, shells, or similar physical ammunition, its capacity is doubled. If it uses batteries, it can hold two batteries of the normal size for that weapon, drawing charges from either.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.F2fSirsWGd6hMtKJ]{Enhanced Prototype Proficiency (Ex)- 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your prototype weapon with one hand without penalty, even if it is normally a two-handed weapon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0utN5rLSZOoTLScv]{Advanced Customization (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can apply one of the following weapon special properties to your experimental weapon prototype. You can apply only special properties that are applicable to the weapon you’re using, so you couldn’t (for example) add quick reload to a weapon that doesn’t use charges or ammunition. The GM is the final arbiter of what can be applied to any weapon. Choose from: aurora, block, breach, breakdown, bright, disarm, echo, extinguish, feint, injection, harrying, penetrating, quick reload, recall, stun, trip.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can add a second weapon special property from that list, or you can add force as a second weapon special property. Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, knockdown. You may add this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a critical hit both effects apply. A weapon cannot have two versions of the same critical hit effect.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can instead add the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blind}, demoralize, wound, sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon property or a critical hit effect.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can switch any of these customizations for a different customization, but you must always choose at least one customization from the 7th-level list.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.kXG9x8sTS6B5CIDA]{Versatile Design (Su) - 10th Level}</h2>\n<p>Long hours of research and tinkering have taught you how to modify your weapon prototype on the fly. Select four weapon fusions of a level your prototype weapon qualifies for. Your weapon gains one of these fusions without it counting against the total item levels of fusions it can have. With 10 minutes of work, you can change the weapon fusion currently installed in your weapon prototype to another of your selected fusions. If a fusion selected with this ability has a limited number of uses, using it counts against the uses of any other fusion you access with this ability. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can change the four fusions you have selected.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.yYpUKezJS6BC6aGv]{Dual Chambers (Ex) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>You modify your experimental weapon prototype to deal multiple types of damage. Select one additional type of weapon damage that your weapon does not normally deal. When you attack with your experimental weapon prototype, you can deal either type of damage or both. Switching between damage types, or switching your weapon to deal both, is a move action. Each time you gain a level, you can switch your secondary damage type, but you can’t change the weapon’s original damage type without crafting a new experimental weapon prototype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.mz2KNUvTjMxmk6FV]{Target-Rich Environment (Ex)- 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; You enhance your experimental weapon prototype’s attack power, allowing you to deal extra damage to multiple enemies.

A creature can disable a mine it spotted with a successful Engineering check (DC 10 + your soldier level + your key ability score modifier) as though it were a trap, and the mine deactivates harmlessly if destroyed (hardness 10, with Hit Points equal to 3 × your soldier level). A mine remains armed for 1 hour or until you create a new mine.</p>\n<p>The next time a creature enters the square, the mine explodes, dealing 1d4 fire and piercing damage to any creaturein that square and imposing a –5-foot penalty to its speed for 1d4 rounds.

Once implanted, the personal augmentation occupies that system, preventing the installation of any other upgrade, and you can only remove or implant the augmentation in a new system through the transform biotech class feature (see below). The personal augmentation provides a benefit based on which of your body’s systems you implant it in, as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Arms (all)</strong>: Treat your Strength score as 6 higher for the purpose of determining your bulk limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: Add one Intelligence-based skill to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using that skill, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Ears</strong>: You take no penalty to sound-based Perception checks when you are sleeping, and gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects that would deafen you.</p>\n<p><strong>Eyes</strong>: For targets you attack, reduce the miss chance due to concealment to 15%. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks based on sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Feet (all)</strong>: You can move through up to 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. This allows you to take a guarded step into difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Hands (All)</strong>: You can attempt Sleight of Hand checks as if you were trained in the skill, and you can retrieve a weapon or object hidden on your person in the same amount of time it would take to retrieve it were it not hidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: Add Bluff to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using Bluff to lie, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Legs (all)</strong>: Gain a +1 bonus to your AC against combat maneuvers that would change your position, such as bull rush, reposition, or trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Lungs</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against thick, severely thick, thin, and severely thin atmospheres, as well as against gas effects that are negated by not needing to breathe (such as a smoke grenade).</p>\n<p><strong>Skin:</strong> You are protected from the dangers of extreme heat and cold as if you were wearing armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Spinal Column</strong>: Add Acrobatics to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using Acrobatics to balance, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Throat</strong>: Your voice is augmented, allowing you to be heard clearly even in extremely loud areas, such as windstorms and even hurricane-force winds.

The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. Additionally, if the creature fails its save, for the same duration it can’t use any biotech augmentations that require an action to activate.

You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104).

If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></sub> Graviton Revelation</p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/photon.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></sub> Photon Revelation</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">1st Level</h2>\n<p>Solarians gain the following stellar revelations at 1st level</p>\n<p><sub><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></sub> </sub>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.IhyIqvMRvRuDYTLw]{Black Hole (Su)}</p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/photon.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></sub> @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.RQlIIC7yl9XwNiun]{Supernova (Su)}</p>\n<p>Solarians with @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.CkndBsEO0IMsYZ4m]{Electrical Attunement (Su)}&nbsp;gain these revelations at 1st level instead.

This potential takes the form of a pool of Mutation Points (MP).</p>\n<h3>Gaining MP</h3>\n<p>Except where noted otherwise, you can gain Mutation Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Core Rulebook242). During combat, you gain 1 Mutation Point at the start of your turn. Once per turn, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain 1 Mutation Point. At the end of combat, you lose all Mutation Points.

This gives you two beneficial instincts and one drawback; each of these provides an effect based on the number of MP you have, plus the cumulative effects of all lower MP values.

If you’re wearing heavy or powered armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your EAC, though this can’t increase your EAC above your KAC.</p>\n<p><strong>5 MP:</strong> Once per round, when you deal damage with your adaptive strike, you can increase the damage dealt to one target by an amount equal to half your evolutionist level (minimum +1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>6 MP:</strong> You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>7 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to speed increases to +20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>8 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to your AC or EAC increases to +2.</p>\n<h3>Spending MP</h3>\n<p>Along with these standard ways you can spend Mutation Points, some evolutionist adaptations (page 13) add more.</p>\n<p><strong>1 MP:</strong> You can spend 1 MP on your turn to manifest your adaptive strike without taking an action.</p>\n<p><strong>2 MP:</strong> As a swift action, you can spend 2 MP to gain either a climb speed equal to half your land speed or a swim speed equal to half your land speed. This effect lasts 3 rounds. When you take a full action to charge, run, or withdraw, you can activate this ability without taking an action, rather than as a swift action.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Once per round, you can spend Mutation Points with no effect (which you might want to do to lose penalties, for example). If you use this ability as a move action, you can spend up to 2 MP. If you use this ability as a standard action, you can spend up to 4 MP.

If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do you favors.

The target surface must be solid but does not need to be capable of sustaining plants normally. The vines have a reach of 5 feet and attempt to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area; such a creature must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition. Creatures that successfully save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must attempt a new save at the end of your turn each round. Creatures moving into the area must attempt a save immediately; failure ends their movement and they become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}. An @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} creature can break free as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or DC 15 Strength check. The vines last for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level, and the entire area is difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

This ability lasts for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level; this duration doesn’t need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Your base form and size are largely unchanged, but some of your body parts are altered. Armor and gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape for the duration of this ability. You can have only one of these adaptations active at a time; choosing a new adaptation is a standard action and the new choice replaces the old. At 12th level, the climb and swim speeds granted by your adaptation are equal to your land speed, and you add wings (granting you a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability) to the list of possible adaptations.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ipaMMMD39lxyK5xf]{Reactive Resistance (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n <p>The first time each day you would take energy damage, you immediately gain resistance 10 to that energy type for the remainder of the day.

You can’t use this ability if your reactive resistance class feature has not yet been activated for the day.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.QC3BLXs6MJ1uM5CL]{Plant Transport (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n <p>Once per day as a full action, you can enter any living plant equal to your size or larger and exit from another plant of the same kind in the same solar system, regardless of the distance separating the two. The destination plant does not need to be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you merely designate direction and distance and this ability moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, this ability fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You cannot travel through plant creatures. You can bring along objects as long as their bulk doesn’t exceed your Strength score. You can also bring up to five willing Medium or smaller creatures (each carrying no more bulk than their Strength scores) with you, provided they are linked to you with joined hands.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.CrkdUAcKCaiuViaB]{Guided Rebirth (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n <p>As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend all your remaining Resolve Points as a full action to surround yourself with an organic cocoon.

Your experimental apparatus is a hybrid item that must be held in one hand to impart any benefit. Incorporated into the apparatus is one nonconsumable hybrid or magic item with an item level of 1 and no more than 1 bulk. The apparatus has light bulk, but it becomes 1 bulk if it has an incorporated item that has 1 bulk. While you wield the apparatus, you gain the benefits of the incorporated hybrid or magic item, even if you are already wearing your maximum number of hybrid or magic items. Due to its esoteric design and controls, you are the only one who can gain any benefit from the apparatus.</p>\n<p>You can incorporate additional items into the apparatus to expand its functions, including hybrid items, magic items, and magitech augmentations (for the arm, brain, endocrine, hand, or throat systems). An incorporated item’s item level cannot exceed your mechanic level, its bulk cannot be greater than 1, and the apparatus can accommodate a total of only two incorporated items (including the apparatus’s starting item). Incorporating an item into the apparatus takes 8 hours of work and functionally destroys that item in the process. Each item has its own set of charges, if any. You only gain the benefits of a single incorporated item at a time, though you can switch which item is active as a standard action, or as a move action if you spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>If your apparatus is destroyed or lost, you retain its schematics in your custom rig and can rebuild a version of it for free after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your apparatus. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your apparatus with the same amount of work, allowing you to replace one of the installed items at no cost, selecting an item with an item level no higher than the item level of the item being replaced.</p>\n<p><strong>Experimental apparatus replaces the artificial intelligence (AI) class feature.</strong></p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.5iFdZAwtOc1oitja]{Mystical Technician (Ex) - 1st Level}</h3>\n<p>Add Mysticism to your list of class skills in place of Computers.

You gain a limited version of the technomancer’s spells class feature, though you can use these spells only while wielding the apparatus, and your selection of spells is limited to those spells embedded in the apparatus. You have one 1st-level spell slot and one 2nd-level spell slot, and you can cast the 0-level spells at will. You gain one 3rd-level spell slot at 13th level, and you gain one 4th-level spell slot at 16th level. Casting these spells does not expend the incorporated spell gems. Your experimental apparatus can store a maximum number of spell gems equal to half your mechanic level, and these spell gems can be of any level. You can incorporate and replace spell gems in the apparatus as you would new magic items, and incorporated spell gems are effectively destroyed once installed.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you would gain a new mechanic trick, you can instead increase the number of spell gems the apparatus can hold by one, as well as gain one additional spell slot of your maximum spellcasting level, to a maximum of four spells per level.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MjhKrwd5yWe9fAxl]{Versatile Apparatus (Ex) - 15th Level}</h3>\n<p>Your experimental apparatus can now accommodate up to four incorporated items.

This field grants you temporary Hit Points and fortification as if it were a force field with an item level equal to or lower than your mystic level. This field doesn’t block gases, liquids, or light. If the field drops to 0 temporary Hit Points, it ends. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 × your mystic level, but these rounds need not be consecutive. In general, it can be assumed you have enough air or loose matter around you to use this ability, but in some circumstances, such as when you are surrounded by vacuum, the GM is free to rule that this ability can function only if you can provide a source of matter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.b7Tcd5E3v09pkvE7]{Matter Sense (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You develop a feel for the movement of matter around you. You gain blindsense (vibration) with a range of 30 feet, and you gain the Blind Fight feat. If you already have blindsense (vibration), increase its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MffwoUuFX1saPrUK]{Shape Matter (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can shape unformed matter into items you need. To do so, you follow the rules outlined on page 235 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook, using the exceptions that follow. You need no tools or workshop, only your will and matter to rearrange— UPBs or an existing item. An existing item imparts only 10% of its value toward the cost of your creation. In any case, the raw materials must be in your possession and can’t be carried or worn by another creature or exist as part of a structure. Creating an item this way takes 10 minutes. However, if your number of ranks in the appropriate skill to craft an item exceeds that item’s level by 5 or more, you can craft that item in 1 minute. If your ranks exceed the item level by 10 or more, you can create the item as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If you create an item that has daily uses (such as a magic item) or charges (such as a battery) with this ability, the item starts with no uses or charges available but can be recharged normally. However, consumable items function normally. Items you create or convert using this ability can have no more bulk than you have mystic levels and can’t exceed Large size.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.k784iwD8SP5T2gds]{Apportation (Sp) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over material objects and are able to transport small amounts of matter from one spot to another without those objects crossing the intervening space. A number of times per day equal to half your mystic level, you can teleport a nonliving, inanimate object that you are touching and that has up to 2 bulk up to 500 feet away. You do not need to be able to see the destination, but you must be able to clearly describe it, such as “500 feet north.” If the object would arrive in an occupied space, this ability fails but is still expended. Alternatively, you can teleport an object within 500 feet to yourself; you must be able to clearly identify both the object and its current location. You can choose to be holding the object when it arrives, if you are able to hold it; otherwise, the object arrives on the ground in your space.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.7hIQ7ML6t0nAyICK]{Phasing (Sp) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can temporarily cause your body and gear to become out of phase with other matter. For a number of rounds per day equal to your mystic level, as a move action, you can phase. These rounds need not be consecutive. When you’re phased, you can pass through walls or material objects other than corporeal creatures, provided you begin and end your turn outside of the object. During a round in which you phase, attackers who target you with attacks and effects have a 20% miss chance, and you take only half damage from area effects. Force effects block your phasing and have no miss chance or reduced damage when targeting or affecting you. You cease phasing if you are incapable of thinking.</p>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow up to one willing creature per 3 mystic levels you have to phase with you, provided such creatures are within 30 feet of you when you phase. However, each additional creature you phase consumes 1 round of your phasing duration each round it remains phased, and it ceases being phased when you do or if it strays more than 90 feet from you. If a creature is part of your mystic telepathic bond, however, it consumes 1 round the first round it is phased and 1 additional round every other round thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hXfGudMaFYNFlAlY]{Molecular Wall (Sp) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>Up to two times per day, you can manipulate the air and minuscule amounts of matter around you to create a protective field. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use wall of force as a spell-like ability. As with matter field, the GM can rule that you lack sufficient matter to create such a field, depending on your circumstances. In this case, you can create the wall out of psychic matter (sometimes called ectoplasm) that you will into temporary existence. When you do this, the wall costs you 1 additional Resolve Point and lasts half as long.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can create your matter field out of the same psychic matter you can use to create molecular walls. If you do, each round your matter field exists expends 2 rounds from your daily uses of matter field.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.o3fPRrAiclGesrFR]{Translocation (Sp) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can invert the matter of the universe, creating a portal to other worlds.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–10: Technomancer <em>(Below).</em> In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–11: Technomancer Bonus Spells <em>(Below)</em>—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–12: Technomancer Spells Known <em>(Below).</em> Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.</p>\n<p>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p><h2>Spells Per Day</h2><table class=\"inner\" style=\"height: 336px; width: 205px;\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 16px;\"><td style=\"width: 57.2px;

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–5: Mystic Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.</p>\n<p>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p><h2>Spells Per Day</h2><table class=\"inner\" style=\"height: 336px; width: 205px;\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 16px;\"><td style=\"width: 57.2px;

This is a class skill for your drone, and it gains a number of ranks in the chosen skill equal to your class level. Your drone can use this skill when not under your direct control. You can change your drone’s skill unit whenever you rebuild your drone from scratch. Additionally, whenever you are directly controlling your drone, it can use any of your skill ranks if you wish, assuming it has the appropriate tools to do so (a drone without manipulator arms cannot use Engineering to disable a device, for example).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.BIUeOXScAAA53iRA]{Expert AI (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s AI has grown more sophisticated, giving it a more robust combat routine when not under your direct control. Each round on your turn, the drone can take a move action, take a standard action to attack, or make a full attack (this last option allows it to shoot more than once if it has the necessary weapons to do so). The drone takes a –6 penalty to full attacks made without your direct control instead of the normal –4 penalty. Like limited AI, you must still be conscious and within range.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hMJAD02T8K1XTjJ1]{Upgraded Power Core (Ex) - 10th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your drone gains a pool of Resolve Points equal to 1 per 2 levels it has (minimum 1). Your drone can spend 1 Resolve Point to make a full attack without requiring your direct control and at only the normal –4 penalty for a full attack instead of the –6 penalty. Your drone regains Resolve Points after a full 8-hour rest as normal.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cQtmz297P5g6g5xv]{Advanced Mods - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can choose from any of the mods on the advanced mod list whenever your drone gains a new mod (in addition to those from the basic mod list). Your drone must always have at least 5 mods from the basic list before you can add any advanced mods, even if you rebuild your drone after it gains this ability. The list of advanced mods appears on pages 78–79.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.OrRcG0AuwiWBQE2O]{True AI (Ex) - 20th level}</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s AI can act with complete autonomy. Each round on your turn, your drone can take a full suite of actions (either a full action or else a move action, a standard action, and a swift action) without requiring your direct control, and it makes full attacks without your direct control with the normal –4 penalty. You don’t need to issue commands to your drone for it to take actions. You must still directly control the drone for it to use your skill ranks.</p>\n<h1>Drone Feats</h1>\n<p>When choosing feats for your drone, you can choose from the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.xHTJgEqLsHVZKyk4]{Blind-Fight (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.f4Ejv0o7TpUwqaJQ]{Cleave (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.1P1O0BHojSINAbRg]{Deadly Aim (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.i3l4HZjn6MBEWiVe]{Far Shot (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.bMjPH2VpKBHxpdRJ]{Great Cleave (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.UwmeR3lCfm936vxe]{Great Fortitude}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.0Pq35gvSI2JlD682]{Improved Combat Maneuver (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.8BuU1VMQgMbMsz0i]{Improved Critical (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.d7o4eg6e0xgstNfQ]{Iron Will}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.XclQNdMnHZc1R33O]{Jet Dash}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.xMEVPWX20WPPiwcq]{Kip Up (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.bTzOH89OmNana18M]{Lightning Reflexes}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.6ROyFIpOxKzCynH1]{Lunge (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.K1DuZQv4CKQHxnIk]{Mobility (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.01aOr5z3Qc2xV8Ml]{Multi-Weapon Fighting (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.seWKgVZbtyOPhl6e]{Nimble Moves (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.IHElfv0Xwj3yCfVH]{Opening Volley (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.IILK03DmelCL6eLJ]{Penetrating Attack (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.ACti4nBLewJMvG8R]{Shot on the Run (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.dkDzFtHOTXLnJivf]{Skill Focus}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.ZCs2NGwo5y2rUkRs]{Skill Synergy}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.KKokTVjGbpDsLTe8]{Slippery Shooter (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.pw41PalbzAAGnOzY]{Spring Attack (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.KbhyKPDGwmG2L9DA]{Strike Back (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Bl1Dw3CX7Brl1AC2]{Suppressive Fire (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.RoFGEpXnB4YGsz4K]{Versatile Focus (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Ph3nPNKZtR2io3wi]{Versatile Specialization (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.bMZTC3m95OSPFlTG]{Weapon Focus (Combat)}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.9Us7Eg9cAoq3BcS5]{Weapon Specialization (Combat)}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 10th level, when the drone has an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hMJAD02T8K1XTjJ1]{Upgraded Power Core (Ex)}, you can also choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.S6m7n9AqKF0KOh7m]{Extra Resolve}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.gHFaGEQj42de9zmT]{Improved Great Fortitude}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.wkYOPC6hK4otQ4K8]{Improved Iron Will}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.spAncs884V1Xlyz2]{Improved Lightning Reflexes}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GMs can expand this list to include feats from other sources.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Artificial Intelligence","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}}

If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} for 1 round.</p></li><li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li><li><p><strong>2nd (Environmental)</strong><sup><strong>IS</strong></sup><strong>:</strong> You stabilize the affected area, steadying unsteady terrain, preventing collapse, and filling gaps. Reduce the DCs to avoid falling, maintain footing, and balance in the area by 5. The area can collapse only due to circumstances that change after you create this effect or if the GM rules stability is impossible. For example, you can hold a collapsing cave in place for the duration but not a platform lacking any other support. Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have.</p></li><li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li><li><p><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</p></li><li><p><strong>3rd (Environmental)</strong><sup><strong>IS</strong></sup><strong>:</strong> You create a translucent sphere of protection centered on you that moves with you. This barrier and bubble of altered reality might be a thin, semisolid fog, a field of wind, or a bubble inside a film of ectoplasm. This sphere’s boundary provides soft cover and concealment. Atmosphere, gravity, and temperature are tolerable for any creature inside the sphere. Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have.</p></li><li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li><li><p><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</p></li><li><p><strong>4th (Environmental)</strong><sup><strong>IS</strong></sup><strong>:</strong> You create open space in the affected area, provided any structural material and big masses, such as rubble or liquids, in the area have a hardness of 15 or lower. The effect makes it easy to temporarily excavate an area, removing all inanimate objects, but it’s harder to use to replace artificial structures, such as a standing stone building or vault, or to join strongly disparate environments, such as a starship interior and hard vacuum. The GM can increase a structure’s effective hardness by 10 if it meets these criteria. Creating this effect in an area with any structural material harder than hardness 15 requires you to succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against a DC equal to the hardness of the hardest structural material in the area. If this check fails, the alternate reality fails to manifest, and the spell slot used for this ability is expended with no effect.</p>\n<p>This open space doesn’t damage surrounding structures or cause them to collapse, and it temporarily holds out moving materials, such as flowing water or unstable debris. If you open this space in an area that contains creatures, they remain and act appropriately according to other environmental factors that don’t change, such as atmosphere and gravity.</p>\n<p>Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have. When the effect ends, creatures and objects that weren’t inside the open area before it appeared are safely shunted to the nearest open space outside the effect. Creatures and objects that were inside the area before it appeared and remained inside are safely shunted back to their original locations. You could, for instance, use this effect to rescue a creature buried in rubble, but removing the creature from the affected area before the superimposed space disappears is crucial.</p></li><li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li><li><p><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</p></li><li><p><strong>5th (Environmental)</strong><sup><strong>IS</strong></sup><strong>:</strong> Creatures in the area move and act normally despite being encumbered, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, off kilter, paralyzed, staggered, or hindered by another effect that reduces activity or speed, such as the slow spell. Within the area, creatures can’t be grappled or otherwise bound, and they automatically succeed at escaping from being grappled, pinned, or bound. Also, creatures ignore effects from the environment, such as from being underwater or in zero gravity, when moving and attacking. If a creature ignores an ongoing effect due to being in the area, the ongoing effect’s duration continues to elapse, and the effect resumes normally if the creature leaves the area or this effect ends.</p></li><li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li><li><p><strong>6th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</p></li></ul>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":""},"formula":"","modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"none","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Witchwarper","target":{"type":"","value":""},"uses":{"max":0,"per":"","value":0}}}

This weapon appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. The shape of normal ranged weapons—such as pistols, crossbows, and handcannons are fairly common—but more esoteric manifestations such as a shimmering crystal that launches fragments of itself, a dark aura that forms directly onto your foes, or an orb of stellar energy that releases beams of pure light are also possible.

You can select only from the following special grafts: amphibious, computer-assisted controls, junk, luxury, racer, or transport. At 7th level, you can select any type grafts or special grafts when designing your vehicle, and at 10th level, your vehicle can have the Huge size graft.

You can take a single 8-hour rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your vehicle. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can redesign and rebuild your vehicle with the same amount of work, though if the new design’s price is higher, you must expend credits equal to the difference between their prices.

The miniaturized vehicle follows you automatically, though as a move action, you can command it to remain in place or resume following you. As a full action while adjacent to your vehicle, you can restore it to its normal size and functions and board it.

You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal.

As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.</p>\n<p>As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab’s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it’s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.</p>\n<p>You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target’s condition require the microlab be re-attuned.

These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented on page 75.</p>\n<h2>Drone Base Statistics</h2>\n<p>Your drone’s abilities are determined by your mechanic level (or the level you assign to it through your control net ability) and the mods you select for your drone. The below table determines many of the base statistics for your drone. These base statistics modify the starting statistics determined by the drone’s chassis. The terms used in the table are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Level: This is equal to your mechanic level. If you have the control net class feature and assign fewer levels to your drone than you have, the drone’s base statistics are determined by the level you assign to it.</li>\n<li>Hit Points: This is the drone’s maximum number of Hit Points. For the purposes of spells and other effects that rely on Hit Dice or level, your drone’s equivalent Hit Dice or level is equal to your mechanic level (or the level you have assigned to it with the control net class feature). Drones do not have Stamina Points.</li>\n<li>Base Attack Bonus: This is the drone’s base attack bonus.</li>\n<li>Armor Class: Add the listed bonus and the drone’s Dexterity modifier to base Armor Class values listed for its chassis to determine the drone’s total EAC and KAC. Your drone cannot wear armor of any kind, and you cannot increase your drone’s AC further without selecting the appropriate mods.</li>\n<li>Good Save Bonus, Poor Save Bonus: These are the drone’s base saving throw bonuses. Each chassis type designates which saving throw uses the good save value and which ones use the poor save value.</li>\n<li>Ability Increase: Increase two of your drone’s ability scores, as designated by its chassis, by this amount.</li>\n<li>Feats: This is the drone’s total number of feats. You can select a drone’s feats from those listed in Drone Feats on page 76. A drone cannot select a feat that requires a base attack bonus of +1 until it gains its second feat at 3rd level.</li>\n<li>Mods: This is the number of custom modifications you can add to your drone.</li>\n<li>Special: Your drone gains these abilities when you reach (or assign via control net) the appropriate level, as noted on the table. These abilities are described in the section below.</li>\n</ul>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">Class Level</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">Hit

If you designate a linked creature as the target of a spell that normally has a range of personal, the linked creature is affected as if it were you, and you are unaffected.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.uWE9zJRmXpoBeLuU]{Hive Bond (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your telepathic bond class feature to include unwilling targets.

You must have Stealth as a class skill to select this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.33fxlqpShtqndjry]{Arcane Assailant}</h2>\n<p>The arcane assailant fighting style supplements its combat effectiveness with magic powers, drawing on traditions of warrior-wizards dating back to well before the Gap. This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don’t have a magic weapon in your possession.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.DAMcKQ3EGXdh8CGe]{Armor Storm}</h2>\n<p>The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor’s capacity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oo4MlB56sziHi0lB]{Battlemaster}</h2>\n<p>The battlemaster fighting style focuses on adapting your natural advantages to new dangers and situations as they arise. By anticipating particular threats or adjusting mid-combat to deal with specific foes, you can assure your survival and gain the advantage. The following soldier fighting style is an adaptation of this technique that has made its way to the Pact Worlds. You must have the armor savant and natural weapons racial traits to take this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.AKI0TQ3pSwmU5twg]{Blitz}</h2>\n<p>The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.YHaMYdptLi3fXfVH]{Bombard}</h2>\n<p>The bombard fighting style emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hdaFHWL1GAnSF4ZO]{Bullet Rain}</h2>\n<p>Whether the roar of flamethrowers heralds your entrance or the staccato beat of bullets punctuates your battle cries, you’re a master at using heavy weapons.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.6EJMD8EZbjuSnJPs]{Farshot}</h2>\n<p>For some, the best combat strategies eliminate the opposition before they’re even halfway close enough to pose a credible threat. You’re adept at keeping a low profile while launching consistent, patient, and deadly attacks from afar. This style is especially well suited to sniper weapons; activating a weapon’s sniper special property to increase a weapon’s range (typically as a move action) is referred to below as “aiming a sniper weapon,” and attacks made with that increased range are referred to as “aimed shots.”</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.qjAwXnudUtBHdZCe]{Fourfold Tactician}</h2>\n<p>A fourfold tactician is a master of making use of multiple weapons and still having a spare hand. You must have four or more arms to select or use this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oHKHSbFfmBgFfvW8]{Guard}</h2>\n<p>The guard fighting style focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Jba9qeZX5QgjZvwQ]{Hit-and-Run}</h2>\n<p>The hit-and-run fighting style focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.GvubHqBOlV1CsWvz]{Hunter}</h2>\n<p>You’re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks. You may use this expertise as a sniper, trophy hunter, sport enthusiast, or fugitive tracer. Far more focused on skills than other soldiers, your unique talents combine experience in the field with refined combat ability.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.DtbNSlkOtxaaplbr]{Mine Menace}</h2>\n<p>A fair fight might earn a soldier bragging rights, but it’s just as likely to earn them a shallow grave. To compensate for their smaller stature, kobolds often employ traps to hinder their foes and level the playing field. Most notably, this fighting style relies on deploying inexpensive proximity mines and making cunning strikes while an opponent is rattled by the explosions.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.LpwKay3dwLJyjwra]{Powerhouse Style}</h2>\n<p>You specialize in getting the most out of unwieldy weapons, swinging the likes of doshkos and swoop hammers with unstoppable force. After all, you only need to hit your opponent once, as long as you hit them hard enough.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.2C2NBundSvw79yKG]{Qi Adept}</h2>\n<p>You are able to tap into your personal life force, enabling you to unleash incredible strikes upon your foes. Whether you’ve discovered these techniques on your own or studied at ancient monasteries and temples devoted to these lost arts, yours is a power cultivated through intense training and skill.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.bSx9gMPZnyCUHyhG]{Rover}</h2>\n<p>No wilderness gets the better of you, and thanks to your special training and hard-learned lessons, your leadership might be crucial to your companions surviving the wilds as well.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PSAr1JTGPZQ9g1j8]{Sharpshoot}</h2>\n<p>The sharpshoot fighting style enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.tniq6wm0fQSzLbB0]{Shock and Awe}</h2>\n<p>The shock and awe fighting style excels at overwhelming enemies senses with overpowering auditory and visual stimuli. You can modify your weapons to issue thunderous booms or blazing flashes of light, at the same time mitigating these effects with regard to your own senses. This style is strongest with weapons that deal sonic damage or that affect an area.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.f34cpBT3OiXKXssf]{Squad}</h2>\n<p>Soldiers in large organizations, such as the Stewards, learn to fight effectively together in small squads. You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.HiI3JMXX6crpsWDN]{Wrathful Warrior}</h2>\n<p>The wrathful warrior style draws upon your emotions—specifically your rage and wrath—to enable devastating attacks. You may have trained yourself to intentionally overload your fight-or-flight adrenaline response, or may just come from a long line of berserker warriors. At higher levels, you’re able to use your anger to ignore damage and strike with impudence.</p>"},"descriptors":{"acid":false,"air":false,"calling":false,"chaotic":false,"charm":false,"cold":false,"compulsion":false,"creation":false,"curse":false,"darkness":false,"death":false,"disease":false,"earth":false,"electricity":false,"emotion":false,"evil":false,"fear":false,"fire":false,"force":false,"good":false,"healing":false,"language-dependent":false,"lawful":false,"light":false,"mind-affecting":false,"pain":false,"poison":false,"radiation":false,"scrying":false,"sense-dependent":false,"shadow":false,"summoning":false,"teleportation":false,"water":false},"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","rollNotes":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"Soldier","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}}

At 5th level and again every 5 levels thereafter, the shield bonus when aligned against one target increases by an additional +1.</p>\n<p>You can make unarmed attacks with your solar shield; these attacks are not archaic, and you threaten squares within your reach while it is formed. You can add solarian weapon crystals to your solar shield as if it were a solar weapon, in which case their benefits apply to unarmed attacks you make with the shield. The damage type of these attacks is the same damage type as the type granted by the <em>solarian weapon crystal</em>, and if the solarian weapon crystal does not specify a damage type, it deals bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p>Forming or dismissing a solar shield is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar shield is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 76px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\"><strong>Solar Shield</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41px;\">+1/+6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"descriptors":[],"dex":null,"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"equippable":true,"equipped":false,"formula":"","identified":true,"isActive":null,"level":1,"modifiers":[],"price":0,"proficient":true,"properties":{"aeon":false,"amm":false,"analog":false,"antibiological":false,"archaic":false,"aurora":false,"automatic":false,"blast":false,"block":false,"boost":false,"breach":false,"breakdown":false,"bright":false,"buttressing":false,"cluster":false,"conceal":false,"deconstruct":false,"deflect":false,"disarm":false,"double":false,"drainCharge":false,"echo":false,"entangle":false,"explode":false,"extinguish":false,"feint":false,"fiery":false,"firstArc":false,"flexibleLine":false,"force":false,"freeHands":false,"fueled":false,"gearArray":false,"grapple":false,"gravitation":false,"guided":false,"harrying":false,"holyWater":false,"hybrid":false,"hydrodynamic":false,"ignite":false,"indirect":false,"injection":false,"instrumental":false,"integrated":false,"line":false,"living":false,"lockdown":false,"mind-affecting":false,"mine":false,"mire":false,"modal":false,"necrotic":false,"nonlethal":true,"one":false,"operative":false,"penetrating":false,"polarize":false,"polymorphic":false,"powered":false,"professional":false,"propel":false,"punchGun":false,"qreload":false,"radioactive":false,"reach":false,"recall":false,"regrowth":false,"relic":false,"reposition":false,"scramble":false,"shape":false,"shatter":false,"shells":false,"shield":false,"sniper":false,"stun":false,"subtle":false,"sunder":false,"swarm":false,"tail":false,"teleportive":false,"thought":false,"throttle":false,"thrown":false,"thruster":false,"trip":false,"two":false,"unbalancing":false,"underwater":false,"unwieldy":false,"variantBoost":false,"wideLine":false},"quantity":1,"quantityPerPack":1,"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"rollNotes":"","save":{"type":"","dc":"","descriptor":"negate"},"source":"COM pg. 84","specialMaterials":{"abysium":false,"adamantine":false,"coldiron":false,"diatha":false,"djezet":false,"horacalcum":false,"inubrix":false,"khefak":false,"noqual":false,"nyblantine":false,"purplecores":false,"siccatite":false,"silver":false,"voidglass":false},"target":{"type":"","value":null},"usage":{"per":"","value":0},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}}

They can flood out of your body to form a cloud, combine to temporarily create items, or mobilize within you to amplify your physical abilities.</p>\n<p>As a move action, you can direct your nanites to adopt an array. You can have only one array active at a time. Alternatively, you can use a nanite surge (above) to form or switch arrays as a swift action. The nanites maintain their array until you direct them into a different array, you fall unconscious, or you end your turn more than 10 feet from the array. If an array ends without being turned into a different array, the nanites disperse and return to your body at the beginning of your next turn and await further instructions. If you aren’t within 60 feet of the array or the array is physically blocked from reaching you, the nanites instead break down, and you can’t use your nanite array again until you spend 1 Resolve Point and take a full action to create a replacement array.</p>\n<p>Your nanites are technological in nature and can be detected by spells (such asdetect tech), but they aren’t otherwise subject to effects that affect technology.</p>\n<p>The three forms of nanite arrays—sheath, cloud, and gear—</p>\n<p>provide the following benefits only while the specific array is active<br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\"></p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.QoCQEVNtgMhsElwQ]{Sheath Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p>The nanite array reinforces your body, granting you a +1 enhancement bonus to Reflex saving throws and a +1 insight bonus to checks with two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth, selected when you form this array. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>\n<p>When you form a sheath array, you can use a nanite surge to gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your nanocyte level; you lose any such remaining temporary Hit Points when the sheath array ends.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.KOxmSWm5D1jHy8VU]{Cloud Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p>You nanites spread out into a faintly visible cloud that fills a number of contiguous 5-foot squares. The maximum number of squares you can fill this way equals 1 plus your Constitution bonus, and at least one of those squares must be adjacent to you. The cloud is stationary once formed, though you can reconfigure its space as a move action; if you do so, at least one square of the cloud must remain unchanged. When you take a guarded step, you can move 10 feet as long as you begin and end this movement adjacent to or within your cloud array.</p>\n<p>When you form a cloud array, you can use a nanite surge to increase the cloud’s density. This causes the array’s space to provide concealment, but it provides only a 10% miss chance. It doesn’t provide enough concealment to hide, and your attacks ignore any miss chance provided by your cloud. This concealment doesn’t stack with existing concealment.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, whenever you form a cloud array, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 15%. At 7th level, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 20%. At 11th level, the cloud fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus twice your Constitution modifier. At 15th level, when you use a nanite surge while forming the cloud array, any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 25% (though your attacks still ignore any miss chance). At 19th level, the cloud instead fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus four times your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.LLNp1urkLncOxgsb]{Gear Array (EX)}</h3>\n<p>Your nanites shape themselves into a single piece of equipment, such as a weapon, tool, or cybernetic augmentation. You can direct your nanites to create a limited selection of equipment, divided into major forms and minor forms. Major forms include weapons and cybernetic augmentations; minor forms include technological items (excluding armor and weapons) and personal items. At 1st level, you know how to create two major forms and three minor forms. You learn a new minor form at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; you learn a new major form at 3rd level, 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. When you gain a nanocyte level, you can replace one of your major forms with a new major form and one of your minor forms with a new minor form.</p>\n<p>To select a piece of equipment as one of your gear array’s major or minor forms, its level must be equal to or lower than your nanocyte level. Augmentations must be cybernetic, weapons and items must be technological items (not magic or hybrid), and you can’t select equipment that’s consumed on use (such as grenades) or whose bulk exceeds your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p>When creating a nanocyte character at higher than 1st level, for simplicity, you can choose major forms by choosing one form using your nanocyte level, the next form using your nanocyte level – 1, the next using your nanocyte level – 2, and so on. Any extra forms use a nanocyte level of 1. You can choose minor forms the same way.</p>\n<p>When you use your gear array to create a handheld nanite weapon, technological item, or personal item, you can automatically grab and begin wielding it if you have the requisite number of hands free. Otherwise, the item floats in your space until the end of your turn, at which point it drops in your space.</p>\n<p>When you use your gear array to create a cybernetic augmentation, it’s automatically installed in the appropriate body slot as long as that slot is empty; otherwise, it fails to manifest. If a given augmentation has a limited number of uses or frequency, that limit applies regardless of how many times you’ve created it with your gear array. Equipment that requires a battery or ammunition to function must be loaded to function. When you create such equipment, you can have it absorb and automatically load one appropriately-sized battery or set of suitable ammunition in your possession. Any item that uses a battery with fewer than 20 charges can instead use a standard battery.</p>"},"descriptors":[],"duration":{"units":"","value":null},"formula":"","isActive":null,"modifiers":[],"range":{"additional":"","per":"","units":"","value":null},"recharge":{"charged":false,"value":null},"requirements":"1st Level","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"source":"TR, p. 9","target":{"type":"","value":null},"uses":{"max":0,"per":null,"value":0}}}
