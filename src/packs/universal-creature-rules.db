An engulfed creature gains the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XgK4EdO5D3Fj3iWz]{Pinned} condition, takes the listed damage at the beginning of each turn it is engulfed, is in danger of suffocating if it doesn’t have environmental protections, and is trapped within the engulfing creature’s body until it is no longer pinned. An engulfed creature moves with the engulfing creature; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity against the engulfed creature. A creature can engulf one creature that is one size smaller than itself, up to two creatures that are two sizes smaller, or up to four creatures that are three sizes smaller.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
