{"_id":"3NE2nvMbEhINPfdr","name":"Blindsight","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Blindsight is a precise nonvisual sense (or a combination of senses; see page 260) that functions as a more potent version of blindsense. Blindsight operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with blindsight typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsight entry in the creature’s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—say, for example, if a creature that uses scent to perceive through its blindsight loses its sense of smell—the creature loses access entirely to its blindsight. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsight can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have blindsight and succeed at a Perception check to notice a hidden creature, you are observing the creature. Blindsight negates concealment, <em>displacement</em>, invisibility, magical darkness, and similar effects, though a creature with blindsight still can’t perceive ethereal creatures (see the <em>ethereal jaunt</em> spell on page 354). A creature with blindsight cannot be blinded (see page 273) and is not subject to gaze attacks (see the <em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em>).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Blindsight is still limited in many ways compared to normal vision. Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast, though it might be able to make out other features depending on the sense. A creature cannot read written text with blindsight, though it could still use tactile communication. Blindsight works underwater and in fog or smoke, but it typically does not work in a vacuum (although this depends on the nature of the sense; for instance, emotion-based blindsight would work in a vacuum).</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"4D8xxzNTkAujTMHj","name":"Dynamic Hacking Actions","content":"<h2>HACKING ACTIONS</h2>\n<p>The following are common actions used in dynamic hacking encounters. At the GM’s discretion, a hacker might be able to perform actions other than these.</p>\n<h2>Aid (Minor)</h2>\n<p>You run programs, review diagnostics, or look for weaknesses that help your lead hacker with an upcoming task.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Choose one action that a lead hacker will attempt this phase. Attempt the same check, but the DC of your check instead equals 10 or the obstacle’s base DC – 10, whichever is higher. If the obstacle lists additional skills in its Support entry, you can attempt a check with one of those skills in place of the skill typically used for the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The lead hacker gains a +2 bonus to their check to perform that action if they do so before the end of the phase. The bonus increases to +3 if you exceed the DC by 5–9, and increases to +4 if you exceed the DC by 10 or more. A lead hacker can’t gain more than a +4 bonus to any one check from the aid action, even if aided by multiple allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can’t use this action to grant a bonus to one of your own actions.</p>\n<h2>Assess (Minor)</h2>\n<p>You study an obstacle to understand its features.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Process + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You learn the Resolve, Support, Countdown (including the current countdown value), Success, and Special entries for the obstacle. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to resolve the obstacle for 3 phases. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you also identify whether the obstacle has any hidden countermeasures, such as a data bomb or fake shell.</p>\n<h2>Blend (Major)</h2>\n<p>You camouflage your persona and conceal signs of your activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Deceive + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You increase the countdown of all objectives by 1. If you exceed the check’s DC by 5 or more, you can choose one objective and instead increase its countdown by 1d3.</p>\n<h2>Decoy (Major)</h2>\n<p>You create a fake persona that confounds countermeasures.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Deceive + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You create a convincing decoy that lasts until the end of the encounter. When a countermeasure would affect your persona, it has an equal chance of affecting your persona or one of your decoys (such as a 1 in 3 chance of affecting your persona if you have two decoys). Once a countermeasure affects a decoy, that decoy is destroyed with no effect. Countermeasures that do not target a persona (such as wipe) ignore decoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Each time you successfully create a decoy, the DC to create additional decoys increases by 4.</p>\n<h2>Modify (Major)</h2>\n<p>You change a vulnerable program’s functions. This action has a wide range of applications, from deleting a program or changing a module’s data to building or installing a contingent virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> The check varies by the task, determined by the GM. Destroying or destabilizing programs typically requires a Hack check, whereas forging data or installing a backdoor typically requires a Deceive check. Simple tasks might reduce the DC by up to 5, whereas very complicated tasks might increase the DC by up to 5. Some tasks are so vast in scope that they require hours or more—beyond the scope of most hacking encounters.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You successfully perform the action.</p>\n<h2>Recalibrate (Major)</h2>\n<p>You adjust your persona’s subskills for new tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Process – 2</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Reassign the circumstance modifiers you applied when configuring your persona at the beginning of the encounter, setting each modifier between –3 and +3 so long as their sum does not exceed the value allowed by your computer or number of Computers ranks (page 70).</p>\n<h2>Repair (Major)</h2>\n<p>You restore damage sustained by your persona or that of an ally.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Process – 5</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You restore a number of the persona’s lost CP equal to 1d6 + half your ranks in Computers, Engineering, or Medicine (whichever is highest). If your check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, increase the CP recovered to 1d6 + your ranks in Computers, Engineering, or Medicine (whichever is highest).</p>\n<h2>Resolve (Major)</h2>\n<p>You identify and exploit weaknesses in an objective’s code or behavior. This is the action used to defeat objectives, as noted in their respective Resolve entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> The checks required vary by objective.</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You achieve one success toward resolving the objective. If the objective requires multiple successful checks using the subskill you used, and if your check result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, this action is instead treated as two successes toward resolving the objective.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"6OLO3qLTaAenICUz","name":"Urban Terrain","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 397</p>\n<p>Urban terrain can be found in most settlements where the people have greatly exerted their influence over the surrounding environment, constructing buildings where they can live and work in comfort and laying well-defined roads, usually paved. This type of terrain can occur in just about any biome, and it often supersedes the environmental effects of that biome. Urban terrain can include space stations, and it is often replete with technology. The most common rules sections to reference when using urban terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.TN4VeY75Z2Ce8IT7]{Settlements} (see page 405), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.CPkDG7SXnJ0ky8px]{Structures} (see page 406), and Vehicles (see page 228), as well as @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.zDW0cDPQL55G7ose]{Breaking Objects} (see page 409) and sometimes @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.QHtKixa59DI9xQfO]{Radiation} (see page 403).</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In Urban Terrain</h3>\n<p>In a settlement with wide, open streets, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 2d6×10 feet. In a settlement where the buildings are more crowded, standing close together, this distance is 1d6×10 feet. The presence of crowds might reduce this distance.<br /><br />Thanks to twisting side streets and vehicles that can provide cover, it’s usually easy for a creature to use Stealth to hide in a settlement. In addition, settlements are often noisy, making Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, usually increasing the DC of the check at the GM’s discretion.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

However, other forms of interstellar travel existed prior to the Drift. Many of these are still in use today, alongside other recent innovations in stellar drives. While some of these remain in the experimental stage, they provide intriguing alternatives to Drift travel.</p>\n<p>Drift engines enable starships to overcome the limitations of traveling faster than light by entering another plane of existence. Most other interstellar drives also operate by using planar jumps. However, planar travel outside the Drift involves extremely expensive magical technology, often in concert with divine assistance, and such magic is usually tightly controlled by the groups and organizations that use it. As a result, Drift technology is the most commonly available means of interstellar travel, and ships using other methods to travel between stars are relatively rare.</p><p><strong>Restricted:</strong> This particular starship component is typically onlyavailable to a specific group or organization, listed in parentheses.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

During their careers, the player characters will undoubtedly need to venture into space. Traveling from one planet to another, exiting the atmosphere of a planetoid, or visiting an orbiting space station are all examples of common travel that require at least a brief time in space. Many hazards of space can be mitigated by wearing armor (see page 196) or a standard @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.KF7ltBV698hPOQz8]{Space Suit} (see page 231), but sometimes unlucky spacefaring adventurers get caught without them!</p>\n<h3>Cosmic Rays</h3>\n<p>“Cosmic rays” is a catchall term for various interstellar radiation effects. They use the same rules as @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.QHtKixa59DI9xQfO]{Radiation} (see page 403). Most habitable planets maintain atmospheres capable of repelling these emissions. Such protected planets allow, at most, a low amount of radiation in infrequent bursts. Planets devoid of a protective atmosphere are constantly assailed by radiation of medium to severe intensity.</p>\n<h3>Vacuum</h3>\n<p>The void of space is effectively empty of matter, and this vacuum is perhaps the greatest danger of outer space. A creature introduced to a vacuum immediately begins to suffocate (see @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} on page 404) and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per round (no saving throw). Because a vacuum has no effective temperature, the void of outer space presents no dangers from cold temperatures. A creature retains its body heat for several hours in a vacuum. Sound doesn’t travel in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Decompression occurs when a creature suddenly transitions from a pressurized environment to a vacuum, such as by being flung out of an airlock or being inside a sealed structure that becomes heavily damaged. Such a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage (no saving throw) in addition to any suffocation damage.</p>\n<p>Most creatures travel the vacuum of space in a starship.

Each tech relic is indeed a lucky find, for they can’t normally be recreated with modern technological or even magical means. Their very construction often defies foundational principles of modern science.</p>\n<p>Relics of ancient kishalee and sivv civilizations can be found in Starfinder Adventure Path #5: The Thirteenth Gate and Starfinder Adventure Path #33: Dominion’s End, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Relics Overview</h2>\n<p>Relics are rare, lost technologies less powerful than artifacts. They might be weapons, armor, or any other kind of equipment, but they can’t be crafted in a usual manner and are thus always special. Although relics have unusual abilities, each relic has a level—just like other equipment—to give a sense of its relative power and to indicate when it’s appropriate to introduce a relic in a campaign.</p>\n<p>Relics frequently spur adventures. As relics can be of any level, they can appear in adventures designed for PCs that are starting characters or veteran heroes. The PCs might hear rumors of an unusual and possibly unique piece of equipment, prompting them to brave mysterious ruins or contend with cutthroat treasure-seekers to claim the relic as their prize. The PCs might have an enigmatic relic fall into their laps while completing some other task and undertake a new mission to find out what it is, how it works, or how to activate it. A patron might offer a relic as a reward, though an honest one will typically admit the relic might prove more powerful—or more dangerous—than it appears. A cache of relics makes a good hoard for an inscrutable, ancient, or time-displaced villain.</p>\n<p>Relics are often unreliable. While PCs might learn some basics of a relic’s function by trial and error, the relic might work differently under variable conditions (such as when on another plane or used by certain creatures), glitch unexpectedly, or carry some unexpected detriment. Relics often use rare ammunition or batteries that can only be recharged under specific (and often unusual) circumstances; a relic with this type of limitation indicates this in its description. The GM can include other relic quirks or restrictions to keep the players on their toes, but be aware that such glitches might make the PCs regret having worked to collect such an unusual item in the first place!</p>\n<p>The relics presented here are predominantly technological in their function, but they have such strange abilities that they might feel more like magic to the players. All relics, whatever their type, have the following rule.</p>\n<p>Relic: A relic can be sold for 100% of the item’s price, like trade goods. A relic can’t be crafted without a specific (often long-lost) formula, and doing so often requires difficult-to-acquire materials. Even then, it’s rarely possible to recreate more than a few relics before expending the materials, depleting the required tools, or irrevocably warping the blueprints. A relic that becomes understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Relics</h2>\n<p>Weapon relics are abstruse devices discovered under mysterious circumstances. Unlike normal weapons, relic weapons don’t come fully loaded with ammunition unless noted, or unless they have some other indicated reloading method. They’re all treated as uncategorized weapons and are prone to unexpected backlash: on any attack roll of a natural 1, the user must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 the weapon’s level) or else the weapon deals damage to the user rather than the target. (Alternately, relics might use critical fumbles, from the Starfinder Critical Fumble Deck, even if those rules aren’t otherwise used in a campaign).</p>\n<h2>Quirks</h2>\n<p>A tech relic might have any of the following quirks, either randomly determined or specifically chosen.<br /><br /><strong>1. Burbling</strong>: The speech of anyone holding the relic becomes impossible to understand.<br /><strong>2. Crystalline</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it take double damage from sonic damage.<br /><strong>3. Fastidious</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it look clean, spotless, and new.<br /><strong>4. Floating</strong>: The relic can’t rest upon a surface, always hovering and slowly drifting away wherever it’s set down.<br /><strong>5. Keening</strong>: A mournful wail surrounds the relic unless it’s tightly wrapped up.<br /><strong>6. Marked</strong>: Anyone looking at the relic sees a maker’s mark or property tag bearing the viewer’s own name.<br /><strong>7. Menacing</strong>: Bystanders feel the relic is ineffably ominous. 8. Painful: The relic decreases the user’s pain threshold, imposing a –4 penalty to saving throws against pain effects.<br /><strong>9. Predictive</strong>: The relic often finishes the user’s sentences in the user’s voice.<br /><strong>10. Restless</strong>: The relic occasionally teleports itself 5–50 feet in a random direction when not carried or worn.<br /><strong>11. Shedding</strong>: The relic periodically sheds a shell that resembles its exterior, but the item never gets any smaller as a result.<br /><strong>12. Wasting</strong>: Any creature holding the relic seems unhealthy or dilapidated, taking a –2 penalty to saves against afflictions.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"ArWr3NdpKd1ScGn6","name":"Critical Fumble Tables","content":"<h2>CRITICAL FUMBLES</h2>\n<p>Players and GMs can use three methods to determine if an attack is a critical fumble, all triggering only if an attack roll is a natural 1 (the d20 comes up \"1\") and the total attack roll does not meet or exceed the target's AC. Because a critical fumble can be deadly, we recommend using the first option.</p>\n<p>• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker is not proficient with the weapon, or is blinded. confused, or affected by a condition that applies a penalty to attack rolls.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker takes any penalties to the attack roll.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble.</p>\n<h3>USING THE CRITICAL FUMBLE DECK</h3>\n<p>Whenever a character's attack roll is a critical fumble, the player or GM controlling the character draws one card from the deck and follows the result appropriate to that attack's type (energy, kinetic, or spell). If the Extreme Blow! effect matches the damage type (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire. piercing, slashing, or sonic), attack type' (melee or ranged), or weapon category (grenades), that effect must be used instead, </p>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>\n<p>• A critical fumble misses the target unless noted otherwise.<br />• if a critical fumble says you tike weapon damage, this is the base damage for the attack (even if it is an attack made without a weapon), and does not include bonuses for Weapon Specialization, ability modifiers, class features, or similar modifiers.<br />• Required ability checks have a DC of 10 + 1/2 the attack's level (item level for weapon attacks, or, if the attack wasn't made with a weapon, the' attacker's level or CR); skill checks have a DC of 15 + 1-1/2 the level of the attack.<br />• Any effect that requires an Engineering check to fix a weapon uses Mysticism if the weapon is a magic item; or Medicine if the attack was made without a weapon.<br />• Effects that scale by level use a weapon's item level, a spell's caster level, or a character's level or CR for all other effects. Round fractions up.<br />• An effect based on a spell uses the attacker's character level or CR for any calculaffon not defined an the card.<br />• The save DC for an effect triggered by a PC is equal to 10+ 1/2 the level of the attack (see above) + the PC's key ability score. For an NPC, the save DC is based on the ability DC of the appropriate array and CR (Alien Archive 129-131).<br />• An effect that uses the name of an existing critical hit effect (Starfinder Core Rulebook 182) follows the rules for that critical hit effect.<br />• An effect that lasts \"until healed\" ends once the recipient receives healing equal to the damage dealt by the attack. •<br />If a critical fumble says to reroll the attack, use the same attack bonus as the fumbled attack, and deal full damage if the new attack hits the target. </p>\n<p> </p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"CPkDG7SXnJ0ky8px","name":"Structures","content":"<p>CRB pg. 406</p>\n<p>The following rules cover the basic features that can be found in structures.</p>\n<h3>Doors</h3>\n<p>Doors in structures are much more than mere entrances and exits. They can even be encounters all by themselves. Doors come in several types. Consult Table 11–10: Doors for information on common types of doors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking Doors: Structure doors might be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, artificially sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually break through a door with a large weapon such as an assault hammer or other heavy tool.<br /><br />Attempts to chop down a door with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and Hit Points given in Table 11–10: Doors. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines.<br /><br />DC 10 or Lower: A door just about anyone can break open.<br />DC 11–15: A door that a strong person could break with one try and that would take an average person one or two tries.<br />DC 16–20: A door that almost anyone could break, given enough time.<br />DC 21–25: A door that only a very strong person has any hope of breaking, and probably not on the first try.<br />DC 26 or Higher: A door that only an exceptionally strong person has any hope of breaking.</li>\n<li>Locks: Structure doors are often locked and thus require the Engineering skill (or other means) to bypass. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle. Built-in locks (which are usually electronic) either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame or else a sliding iron or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built in but usually run through two rings: one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. A special door might have a lock needing a biometric signature or requiring that the right symbols be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open the door. Because such keyless locks are larger and more complex, they are typically found only in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or steel doors).<br /><br />The DC of the Computers check to hack an electronic system that controls a door or the Engineering check to pick a lock (whether it is mechanical or electronic) often ranges from 20 to 40, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately.<br /><br />Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to strike a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having a hardness of 20 and 30 Hit Points. A lock can be broken only if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied structure, every locked door should have a key somewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>Most fabricated structures have some form of lighting built into the ceilings or walls. This lighting provides enough illumination for the inhabitants to see and is often controlled via a simple switch, touch pad, or vocal device. Lighting can usually be turned on and off on a room-to-room basis, though sometimes a structure’s lighting can be deactivated via a central breaker switch (usually located in some kind of control room or service area). A typical manufactured lighting fixture has a break DC of 18, a hardness of 3, and 10 Hit Points (see page 409 for rules on smashing objects).<br /><br />Natural caverns and structures built by and for creatures with darkvision often lack manufactured lighting. Characters without darkvision must provide their own source of lighting to be able to navigate these locations.</p>\n<h3>Walls</h3>\n<p>Structure walls vary drastically in makeup, ranging from natural, unworked solid stone to reinforced starship bulkheads (though stranger walls exist). While they are typically incredibly difficult to break down or through, they’re generally easy to climb. Table 11–9: Walls contains information on the most common types of walls found in structures.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concrete Walls: These walls are usually at least 1 foot thick. Concrete walls stop all but the loudest noises.</li>\n<li>Starship Walls: Whether the interior walls or the bulkheads that form the outside of the ship, these walls are among the strongest. While they are most commonly used in starship construction, they’re also commonplace in highend planetary structures, such as research stations and military installations.</li>\n<li>Steel Walls: These walls are commonly used within structures of import, such as vaults or older military headquarters.</li>\n<li>Unworked Stone Walls: Hewn walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out of solid rock. Unworked stone is uneven and rarely flat. The rough surface of stone walls frequently provides minuscule ledges where fungus grows and fissures where bats, subterranean snakes, and vermin live.</li>\n<li>Wooden Walls: Wooden walls often exist as recent additions to preexisting structures, used to create animal pens, storage bins, and temporary structures, or just to make a number of smaller rooms out of a larger one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Table

{"_id":"GjzGvCOqijA3OZOD","name":"Surviving Underwater","content":"<p>Related Rules: @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.XXFVHgn8CM2fAYWp]{Aquatic Terrain}</p>\n<p>Source: AP #36 pg. 47</p>\n<p>Most Starfinder adventures assume that the PCs wear armor which affords environmental protections for a number of days equal to its item level (expended in 1-hour increments) unless otherwise specified. These protections provide two primary benefits to a submersed creature: self-contained breathing and protection from the pressures of extreme depths, as described below. The space suit personal item also provides these protections.<br /><br />Most adventures assume that NPCs have adapted to their native environments and therefore ignore many of the dangers and penalties that follow.</p>\n<h2>Suffocation and Drowning</h2>\n<p>Unless a creature has a way to breathe underwater (or doesn’t need to breathe), it must hold its breath or risk drowning. A creature can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. If the creature takes a standard or full action, the remaining duration that the creature can hold its breath is reduced by 1 round. After these rounds have elapsed, the creature must attempt a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. When the creature fails one of these Constitution checks, it begins to suffocate. On the first round of suffocation, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and becomes unconscious (but stable). The following round, it is no longer stable and gains the dying condition. On the third round, the creature suffocates and dies.<br /><br />An unconscious character must begin attempting Constitution checks immediately upon losing air access (or upon becoming unconscious, if the character was conscious when they lost access to air). Once the character fails one of these checks, they are immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition. On the following round, they suffocate and die.<br /><br />Certain effects, such as androids’ constructed racial trait, the life bubble spell, and the water breathing universal creature rule allow creatures to mitigate or ignore this danger.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Depth</h2>\n<p>At certain depths, the pressure of the surrounding water becomes so great that it endangers non-adapted creatures (such as most PCs, including aquatic species).<br /><br />A creature in deep water (100–999 feet deep) must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or gain the sickened condition. This condition ends when the creature returns to a normal depth.<br /><br />Severe depths (1,000 feet or deeper) are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature not accustomed to these depths that needs to breathe must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate as though they’ve lost access to air (see Suffocation and Drowning above). In addition, every hour while at these depths, all such creatures without environmental protections must succeed at an additional Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 cold damage.<br /><br />Note that even aquatic creatures and others able to breathe underwater (or who don’t breathe at all) are still subject to the non-suffocation effects described above.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y","name":"Falling","content":"<p>CRB pg. 400</p>\n<p>A character that falls takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6. A character that takes damage from a fall lands prone.</p>\n<p>If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. On a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, the character avoids taking damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts the damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. For example, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same character deliberately jumps, he takes 1d6 nonlethal damage and 2d6 lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, he takes only 1d6 nonlethal damage and 1d6 lethal damage from the plunge.</p>\n<p>The damage from the first 10 feet of a fall onto a yielding surface (such as soft ground or mud) is converted into nonlethal damage. This conversion is cumulative with damage reduced through deliberate jumps and successful Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>A character can’t cast a spell or activate an item while free-falling unless the fall is greater than 500 feet or the spell or item can be used as a reaction. Casting teleport or a similar spell while falling doesn’t end the character’s momentum; it just changes her location, meaning that she still takes falling damage, even if she arrives atop a solid surface.</p>\n<h3>Falling And Gravity</h3>\n<p>The rules for falling presented here assume standard gravity. For planets with high or low gravity, double or halve the damage amounts, respectively. Falling in extreme gravity deals as least triple the listed damage, and potentially even more.</p>\n<h3>Falling Into Water</h3>\n<p>Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, a falling character takes no damage for the first 20 feet fallen and 1d3 nonlethal damage per 10-foot increment for the next 20 feet fallen. Beyond that, falling damage is lethal damage as normal (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</p>\n<p>A character who deliberately dives into water takes no damage with a successful DC 15 Athletics check or DC 15 Acrobatics check, as long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. The DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.</p>\n<h3>Falling Objects</h3>\n<p>Just as characters take damage when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when they are hit by falling objects.</p>\n<p>An object that falls upon a character deals damage based on its size and the distance it fell. Table 11–7: Damage from Falling Objects determines the amount of damage dealt by an object based on its size. Note that this assumes the object is made of dense, heavy material, such as metal or stone. Objects made of lighter materials might deal as little as half the listed damage, subject to the GM’s discretion. For example, a Huge boulder that hits a character deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage, whereas a Huge wooden wagon might deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage. In addition, if an object falls less than 30 feet, it deals half the listed damage. If an object falls more than 150 feet, it deals double the listed damage. Note that a falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals.</p>\n<p>Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged attack against its KAC. Such attacks generally have a range increment of 20 feet. If an object falls on a character (instead of being thrown), that character can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage if he is aware of the object. Falling objects that are part of a trap use the trap rules (see page 410) instead of these general guidelines.</p>\n<h3>Table 11-7: Damage from Falling Objects</h3>\n<table style=\"height:136px;width:30%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Object Size</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:64.5901%;height:17px;text-align:center\">Colossal</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.1226%;height:17px;text-align:center\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} along to others if it&rsquo;s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. On a failed save, if the victim was affected by a condition as a result of the affliction and that condition was removed (such as by remove condition), the victim regains any conditions from earlier steps along the affliction&rsquo;s progression track (as well as conditions from the current step). A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug&rsquo;s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug} acts as a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease} (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).<br /><br />Each progression track has an end state&mdash;a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn&rsquo;t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.<br /><br /><strong>Curing an Affliction</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease&rsquo;s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} work differently&mdash;fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison's} duration) removes a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison} from the victim&rsquo;s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} might require a longer recovery period.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.ezl3X0BH5JzLbZaX]{Curses} can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.<br /><br />Usually, the spell <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction} </em>immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.i3lpfndXeLq85h12]{Miracle} </em>or <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.i4KITExV7vMeoM24]{Wish}</em>, or in the most extreme cases, <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.AHfzMTHx9PI4Z4zn]{Reincarnate}</em> or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Types</h2>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.ezl3X0BH5JzLbZaX]{Curses}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}</h3>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

However, only a patient demolitionist with the proper training can blow the lid off a crate without scratching the contents, collapse a bridge at an opportune moment, or vaporize a wall to launch a devastating surprise attack.</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Core Rulebook lays out basic rules for arming and activating explosives on pages 141 and 218, though the installation speed and grenade payload better represent an anti-personnel trap than one meant to inflict structural damage. Even a typical door’s hardness and Hit Points are enough to withstand most grenades, making the ordnance required to break a door fairly cost-prohibitive. Anyone who wants to inflict property damage, such as to a door or wall, is better off using the optional demolitions system presented here, along with the expanded rules for the assess stability task of the Engineering skill found in the sidebar on page 69.</p>\n<h2>Demolitions</h2>\n<p>You can use Engineering to arm explosive charges (page 69) that you can trigger later with a detonator (Core Rulebook 218). Applying an explosive charge to a surface typically takes 1 minute, plus 1 minute to program its detonator; this is the primary charge. You can also apply up to five secondary charges to the surface; this takes an additional minute per charge, and each secondary charge must be the same type and mark as the primary charge. After you set the charges, the GM rolls your Engineering check in secret, so you’re not sure how effective your explosive charges are. You gain a circumstance bonus to your Engineering check based on your primary explosive charge’s mark, and the bonus increases by 2 for each secondary charge applied to the surface. The total result can’t exceed the primary charge’s Maximum Result (see Table 2–17: Explosive Charges on this page). The Engineering check DC to disable this explosive is equal to the result of this Engineering check minus the bonuses from secondary charges.</p>\n<p>When you activate the detonator, the charges explode; this functions as a Strength check to break the structure (Core Rulebook 409) that uses your Engineering check’s result in place of the Strength roll. If the check is successful, the explosion breaks apart the structure, allowing movement through its space and preventing it from being closed again (such as for a door). On a success, the explosion also causes collateral damage, dealing fire and piercing damage equal to twice the explosive charge’s mark to all creatures and objects adjacent to the structure (Reflex for half) and filling the damaged area with dust and smoke that grants concealment for 1 round. For every 5 by which the Engineering check exceeds the break DC, the damaging explosion’s radius increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 5 additional feet × the charge’s mark) and its damage increases by an amount equal to the explosive charge’s mark. The total collateral damage can’t exceed the structure’s break DC.</p>\n<p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, the explosion doesn’t harm the structure. If you fail the check by 9 or less, the explosion deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 item levels of the primary explosive charge (rounded up) to the structure; if the demolitions included secondary charges, each one increases the damage by 1d6 (or 2d6 if the secondary charges’ item levels are 10 or higher). If you fail the check by 4 or less, this damage also ignores half the structure’s hardness.</p>\n<p><strong>Controlled Explosion:</strong> When applying explosive charges, you can take a –4 penalty to your Engineering check to limit the subsequent damage, allowing for precise explosions. Choose a number. If your Engineering check result when setting explosive charges exceeds this number, the result is instead reduced to this number.</p>\n<p><strong>Embedded Charges:</strong> Through a combination of careful calculation and drilling holes in the surface to accommodate charges, you can maximize an explosion’s destructive potential. This process takes 10 minutes per charge, 5 minutes per charge of which requires the use of a laser torch (Starfinder Armory 105). As you finish setting the charges, attempt an Engineering check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the primary charge’s item level). If you succeed and all charges used in an explosion are embedded in this way, apply a +2 circumstance bonus to the demolition’s Engineering check; the explosive charges’ maximum result increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Demolitions: </strong>You can halve the time it takes to apply explosive charges, but doing so applies a –5 penalty to your Engineering check to determine the explosion’s result.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Abilities and effects that allow you to increase the rate at which you arm explosives also apply to the demolitions task. If you have an ability that reduces the time required for a specific action (such as the demolition expert envoy expertise talent, Armory 145), you can take that action to arm a single charge.</p>\n<h2>Assess Stability (Engineering)</h2>\n<p>The following expands on the assess stability task on page 141 of the Core Rulebook, adding the ability to evaluate a structure. To do so, you must be within 30 feet of the structure and able to perceive it with a precise sense, or you must have access to detailed schematics. The base DC of this check is 15, modified by any circumstances such as the structure’s complexity or structure. If you succeed, you determine one of the following statistics, plus an additional statistic for every 5 by which you exceed the DC: the structure’s break DC, its hardness, or its Hit Points. If you fail the check, you can retry it after 24 hours.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"N2OOHGUasI1y9Hbj","name":"Damage Reduction (DR)","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some creatures have the ability to instantly heal damage from attacks or ignore blows altogether; this is referred to as the damage reduction special ability. Damage reduction (DR) applies to kinetic damage—any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—that a character takes, regardless of that damage’s source. It does not apply against damage with no damage type or any other damage type, including acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, though these can be mitigated by energy resistance (see page 264).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage the creature ignores from each attack. Weapons made from a certain material, magic weapons (any weapon with a weapon fusion; see page 191), and weapons imbued with a specific alignment often can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/cold iron means that you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not made from cold iron, DR 5/magic means you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not magic, and so on. If a dash follows the slash (“DR 5/—”), then the damage reduction is effective against bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from any weapon, though some attacks have their own ability to overcome DR. Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with a magic fusion or alignment is treated as a magic weapon or having the listed alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Sometimes, multiple types of weapon materials or alignments are indicated after the value of DR, indicating that the damage reduction can be overcome in multiple ways or requires a specific combination of effects to be overcome. For example, DR 5/lawful or magic means any weapon that is of a lawful alignment or that is magic can overcome the damage reduction. In contrast, DR 5/lawful and magic means only weapons that are both of a lawful alignment and magic overcome the damage reduction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an injury-based disease, an operative’s debilitating trick, and poison delivered via an injury. Damage reduction does not negate ability damage, ability drain, energy damage dealt as part of an attack, or negative levels, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack unless the sources granting the damage reduction specifically note otherwise. Instead, you get the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation. Rarely, an effect specifies that it increases a creature’s existing damage reduction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Sometimes damage reduction represents instant healing, while in other cases it reflects the creature’s tough hide or body. In either case, you can see that a conventional attack hasn’t been effective.</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD","name":"Defining Effects","content":"<p><sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Source </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 268</span></sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Whether an effect is created by a class feature, spell, or piece of equipment, it usually has factors such as area, duration, and range that are defined using specific game terms, as well as descriptors that indicate its type of power (and that sometimes affect how it works). The following section describes how effects&rsquo; areas, descriptors, durations, ranges, and targets work, and it also gives the mechanical definition of line of effect and line of sight&mdash;two factors key to determining whether a character can use a spell or piece of equipment effectively.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects cover a defined area. Sometimes an effect&rsquo;s description indicates a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories discussed below. Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point from which the effect originates, but otherwise you don&rsquo;t control which creatures or objects are affected. The point of origin of an effect is always a grid intersection, meaning the point where four squares touch on a tactical battle map.<br /><br />When determining whether a given creature is within the area of an effect, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares, just as you would do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you must count from intersection to intersection. You can count diagonally across a square, but keep in mind that every second diagonal counts as two squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the effect&rsquo;s area, everything within that square is within the effect&rsquo;s area. If the effect&rsquo;s area touches only the near edge of a square, however, things within that square are unaffected by the effect. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Burst, Emanation, Or Spread</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most effects with an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the effect&rsquo;s point of origin and measure its area from that point. </span></p>\n<h3>Burst</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A burst effect applies to whatever is in its area when it comes into effect, including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see. It doesn&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from the burst&rsquo;s point of origin, and its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners. The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst effects are specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin the effect extends. </span></p>\n<h3>Emanation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An emanation effect functions like a burst, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the effect. Most emanations are cones or spheres. </span></p>\n<h3>Spread</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A spread effect extends out like a burst, but it can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the effect spreads out to a given distance in all directions. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see. Calculate distance using the actual distance the effect travels, taking into account turns the effect takes and counting around walls and corners, not through them. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see page 271) to the entirety of the effect&rsquo;s area. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Cone, Cylinder, Line, Or Sphere</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most effects with an area have a particular shape. </span></p>\n<h3>Cone</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A cone-shaped effect extends away from you in a quartercircle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and grows wider as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around corners. </span></p>\n<h3>Cylinder</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">With cylinder-shaped effects, you select the effect&rsquo;s point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle at a height designated in the effect&rsquo;s description, and the effect drops down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped effect ignores any obstructions within its area. </span></p>\n<h3>Line</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A line-shaped effect extends away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect (see page 271). A line-shaped effect applies to all creatures in squares through which the line passes. </span></p>\n<h3>Sphere</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A sphere-shaped effect expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres can be bursts, emanations, or spreads. </span></p>\n<h3>Shapable (S)</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an area or effect entry ends with &ldquo;(S),&rdquo; you can shape the effect. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. The &ldquo;areas&rdquo; of many effects are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular or three-dimensional shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define areas and effects in space. </span></p>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect can have a unique area, as defined in its description. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Areas With Targets</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have areas that target creatures or objects within the specified area. Unlike for targeted effects (see Target on page 272), you do not get to select which creatures are affected; the effect affects all creatures or objects of some kind in the specified area.<br /><br />If an effect restricts which targets are affected (for example, it affects only living creatures), then creatures in the effect&rsquo;s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the number of creatures affected. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Subjects Of Effects</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an effect targets creatures or objects directly, the result travels with the subjects for the effect&rsquo;s duration. If an effect targets an area, it stays within that area for its duration; creatures become subject to the effect when they enter the area but are no longer subject to it when they leave.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Descriptors</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A descriptor is a term that helps define an item, a spell, or another effect in some way. Some effects have more than one descriptor, each of which further refines the ways the effect works and interacts with the world around it, while others have none. Even equipment sometimes has descriptors.<br /><br />The descriptors are as follows: acid, air, calling, chaotic, charm, cold, compulsion, creation, curse, darkness, death, disease, earth, electricity, emotion, evil, fear, fire, force, good, healing, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, pain, poison, radiation, scrying, sense-dependent, shadow, sonic, summoning, teleportation, and water.<br /><br />Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves; they instead describe how spells or effects interact with certain other spells or effects. Some descriptors provide additional information about how the effect to which they are attached operates, as defined below. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Calling</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A calling effect transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The effect grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the effect might limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called die if they are killed on the new plane. A called creature can&rsquo;t be dispelled, even if it was called by magical means. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Charm</h3>\n<p>A charm effect changes how the subject views you. This gives you the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to another creature, but its servitude is not absolute or mindless. Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.<br /><br />A charmed creature retains its original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that it now regards the person who charmed it as a dear friend and gives great weight to that character&rsquo;s suggestions and directions. A charmed creature does not volunteer information or tactics that its master doesn&rsquo;t ask for. A charmed creature never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to it.<br /><br />A creature fights friends it had before being charmed only if they threaten its new friend. Even then, it uses the least lethal means at its disposal, for it wishes to resolve the conflict without causing real harm.<br /><br />A charmed creature can attempt an opposed Charisma check against its master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make it do something it wouldn&rsquo;t normally do even for a close friend. If it succeeds at this check, it decides not to go along with that particular order but remains charmed. If the creature&rsquo;s master commands it to perform an action that the creature would be vehemently opposed to, it can attempt a new saving throw to break free of its master&rsquo;s influence altogether.<br /><br />If a charmed creature is openly attacked by the character who charmed it or by that character&rsquo;s apparent allies, it is automatically freed of the spell or effect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Compulsion</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A compulsion effect overrides the subject&rsquo;s free will in some way, forcing the subject to act in some manner or changing the way its mind works. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Creation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creation effect manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the creator designates. If the effect has a duration other than instantaneous, magic or some other energy holds the creation together, but when the duration ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the effect has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature does not depend on any outside energy for its existence, so it lasts indefinitely once created.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Force</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A force effect deals full damage to incorporeal creatures and blocks their movement. It also blocks the sense through ability.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Language-Dependent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A language-dependent effect uses intelligible language (either audible, visual, or telepathic) as a medium for communication. If you cannot communicate with the target or the target cannot understand what you are communicating, the effect fails to affect that target. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Mind-Affecting</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A mind-affecting effect works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Pain</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A pain effect causes unpleasant sensations but not permanent physical damage. Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fortitude save are immune to pain effects. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Scrying</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A scrying effect creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information while the effect lasts. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same sensory abilities that you have naturally, but not any sensory abilities you gain from other spells or technology. The sensor is a separate, independent source of sensory input for you, and thus it functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened or otherwise suffer sensory impairment.<br /><br />A creature can notice a scrying sensor with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the spell or effect&rsquo;s level). The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell. Lead sheeting, force fields, and some exotic materials and magical protections block scrying effects; if that is the case, you can sense that the effect has been blocked. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Sense-Dependent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A sense-dependent effect has either audible or visual elements, requiring sight or hearing to have any effect. For this kind of effect to affect that target, you must be able to either see or hear the target, and the target must be able to either see or hear you. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Shadow</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A shadow effect creates something that is partially real from an amalgamation of extradimensional energy. Damage dealt by a shadow effect is real. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Summoning</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A summoning effect instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the effect ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from (typically another plane, but not always), but a summoned object is not sent back unless the effect description specifically indicates otherwise. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its Hit Points drop to 0, but it is not really @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform in the place from which it was summoned, during which time it can&rsquo;t be summoned again.<br /><br />When a summoning effect ends and the summoned creature disappears, all spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Teleportation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A teleportation effect involves instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane (see page 471). Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation unless the specific effect notes otherwise, and teleportation effects work within the Drift.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect&rsquo;s duration tells you how long the effect lasts. If a spell, ability, or item has a specific duration and creates one or more effects, those effects last for the duration unless the specific effect notes otherwise.<br /><br />Sometimes an effect is suppressed without being negated or dispelled. When this happens, the effect&rsquo;s duration is unchanged. It still ends at the same time it would have ended if it had not been suppressed. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Timed Durations</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Durations are usually measured in rounds, minutes, hours, days, or other increments. When the time of the effect&rsquo;s duration is up, the energy or force empowering the effect goes away and the effect ends. If an effect&rsquo;s duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly by the GM so you don&rsquo;t know how long the effect will last.<br /><br />Whenever an effect&rsquo;s duration is expressed in a standard unit that measures time, such as hours, days, or even years, it refers to those units as expressed in Pact Standard Time. Under this scheme, a day has 24 hours of 60 minutes each, and a year has 365 days (or 52 weeks). For more information about time and similar concepts in Starfinder, see Time on page 430. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Instantaneous</h3>\n<p>The effect comes and goes the instant it is created, though its consequences might last longer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Permanent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The effect remains until is undone through some method, such as by <em>dispel magic</em> for permanent spells. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Concentration</h3>\n<p>When an effect has a duration of concentration, the effect lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain an effect is a standard action. Any factor that could break your concentration while you are performing activities that require focus (such as casting a spell) can also break your concentration while you&rsquo;re maintaining an effect, causing the effect to end. See Concentration and Interrupted Spells on page 331 for more details. You can neither use an effect that requires concentration nor cast a spell while concentrating on an effect. Some effects last for a short time after you cease concentrating&mdash;typically 1 round per level, though individual effects may vary as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Discharge</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Occasionally an effect lasts for a set duration, or until it is triggered or discharged. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Touch Effects And Holding The Charge</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, most notably spells, have a range of touch (see Range below) and require an action to activate. In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t discharge a touch effect on the round you create it, you can postpone the discharge of the effect (also known as holding the charge) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round until the effect is discharged. If you make any other attack, activate another ability, or cast a spell during this time, the touch effect dissipates.<br /><br />Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Dismissible (D)</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If the duration of a spell or effect ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss the effect at will as a standard action. You must be within range of the effect and be able to fulfill the same conditions required to create the effect&mdash;such as being able to concentrate to cast a spell or having access to the equipment that created the effect&mdash; though you do not actually need to spend the appropriate action. An effect that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the effect is to stop concentrating on your turn.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line Of Effect</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If a weapon, spell, ability, or item requires an attack roll and has a range measured in feet, it normally requires that you (or whoever or whatever is using the ability) have a line of effect to the target to be effective (subject to GM discretion). A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what an attack or ability can affect. A line of effect is blocked by a solid barrier that can stop the effect in question (such as a wall, for most effects), but it is not blocked by purely visual restrictions (such as smoke or darkness). You cannot have line of effect that exceeds planetary range, unless otherwise indicated.<br /><br />You must have a clear line of effect to any creature or object you wish to target or to any space in which you wish to create an effect without an area. For effects with an area, you must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of the effect. An effect that is a burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation affects only an area, creature, or object within line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s starting point, the center point of a cylinder&rsquo;s circle, or an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin). For definitions of these specific terms, see Area on page 268.<br /><br />If you have a line of effect to some of a target&rsquo;s space but not all of it, the target has cover (see pages 253&ndash;254 for more information about cover). Additionally, an otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it may grant cover rather than total cover against an effect, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line Of Sight</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Line of sight is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what you can see. Line of sight is like line of effect, except factors that limit normal vision, such as fog, darkness, and total concealment, can block line of sight. If you can&rsquo;t see a target for any reason, you do not have line of sight to it, and thus you cannot use effects that require you to have line of sight. You cannot have line of sight that exceeds planetary range unless otherwise indicated.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect&rsquo;s range indicates how far from you it can reach. An effect&rsquo;s range is the maximum distance from you that the effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can designate the effect&rsquo;s point of origin. If any portion of the effect&rsquo;s area would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. If a range is based on level, this means caster level for spells, class level for class features, and item level for weapons and equipment. Standard ranges include the following. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Personal</h3>\n<p>An effect with a range of personal is limited to and affects your person only.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Touch</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an effect has a range of touch, you must touch a creature or object to affect your target, which requires you to hit with a melee attack roll (against EAC unless the effect says otherwise) if you are touching an unwilling target. A touch effect that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a weapon can. Some touch effects allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch up to six willing or unconscious targets as part of the activation of such an effect, but all targets of the effect must be touched in the same round that you finish activating the effect. If the effect allows you to touch targets over multiple rounds, touching up to six creatures is a full action. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Close</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of close reaches as far as 25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 levels you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Medium</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of medium reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per level you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Long</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of long reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per level you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Planetary</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of planetary can reach anywhere on the same planet. This also covers targets in orbit around the planet, such as moons and artificial satellites. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">System-Wide</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of system-wide can reach anywhere in the same solar system. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Plane</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of plane can reach anywhere in the same plane of existence. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Unlimited</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, mostly high-level spells, can reach anywhere, even onto other planes. Effects with ranges of unlimited are often very powerful, and they can be difficult or impossible to access until you reach a high level. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Range Expressed In Feet</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have no standard range category, just a range expressed in feet. In this case, the specific effect lists exactly how far its range extends. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Range Increment</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, especially weapons, have a range increment. The weapon can generate an effect at many multiples of this range, but you take penalties if the target is more than one range increment away (see Range and Penalties on page 245).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Target</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have a target or targets. You use these effects on creatures or objects, as defined by the effect itself. You must have line of effect (see page 271) to the target or targets of an effect you wish to use, and you must specifically choose the target or targets. If the effect takes a certain amount of time to activate (such as the casting time of a spell), you do not have to select your target or targets until you finish activating the effect.<br /><br />For example, if you decide to cast a spell that would affect multiple creatures, you need not choose exactly which creatures it affects until you are done casting it and the spell is about to go into effect. This allows you to avoid casting spells or imposing effects on creatures that might have been taken out of a fight or otherwise incapacitated in the interim between your decision to cast a spell and when you&rsquo;ve finished casting it and it&rsquo;s ready to take effect.<br /><br />Some effects restrict which targets can be selected. If an effect targets living creatures, it affects all creatures other than constructs and undead&mdash;in other words, biological or technobiological creatures that are alive. (Artificially created beings that are not undead or constructs are considered living for this purpose.) If an effect targets willing or unconscious targets, it affects only those creatures who wish to be affected by it. A creature can declare itself a willing target at any time (even if it&rsquo;s @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} or it isn&rsquo;t that creature&rsquo;s turn); this does not use up an action and simply requires, for example, a player to inform another player that his character is a willing target. Other effects allow you to target other categories of creatures or items, such as effects that can specifically target a construct, corpse, or object.<br /><br />Some effects allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you activate it. Redirecting an effect is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Effects With Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some targeted effects require an attack roll to hit their target. These effects can score critical hits just as weapons can, and when they do, they deal double damage on a critical hit.<br /><br />If a targeted effect that requires an attack roll lists a duration, it refers to how long the effect lasts on the target (if the attack roll is successful), not how long you have to make an attack.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Abilities And Spell Effects On Large Vehicles</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most vehicles interact with abilities and spells normally; the effects of an explosive blast on an exploration buggy can be determined using the typical rules, for example.<br /><br />However, if you are on an exceptionally large vehicle, such as a sizable aircraft or a starship, the vehicle effectively becomes a type of terrain, and it interacts with the effects of abilities and spells differently. The GM is the final arbiter of what type of vehicle classifies as terrain, but examples include airships, mobile factory crawlers, ocean liners, space stations, starships, trains, or any vehicle larger than a typical creature that is size Colossal or larger.<br /><br />Consult the following guidelines when using abilities or casting spells on vehicles classified as terrain. For the purposes of abilities and spells, exceptionally large vehicles are not considered objects; instead, their various component parts (bulkheads, consoles, walls, etc.) are considered objects. In general, abilities or spells with a stationary or immovable effect (such as <em>wall of force</em>, <em>zone of truth</em>, or the entrance to an Akashic mystic&rsquo;s memory palace) or spells that are anchored to a vehicle (such as <em>wall of steel</em>) move with a vehicle and are not fixed to the physical spot where they are used or cast. In this way, effects that originate from a character on a terrain-sized vehicle and target an area on that vehicle move with the vehicle, instead of manifesting in a static spot that the vehicle quickly outpaces.<br /><br />Beyond these guidelines, the exact effects of an ability or spell that originates from a character on an exceptionally large vehicle are up to the GM.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"QHtKixa59DI9xQfO","name":"Radiation","content":"<h1>Radiation</h1>\n<p>Radiation is a very real threat to adventurers, whether it’s the radiation emitted from stars or the radiation generated by various technological wonders of the universe. Radiation is a poison effect (see page 414) that weakens an affected creature’s Constitution and can also inflict an affected creature with a disease called radiation sickness. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe. The effects of these categories of radiation are described on Table 11–8: Radiation Levels.</p>\n<h2>Area Of Effect</h2>\n<p>Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.</p>\n<h2>Curing Radiation Effects</h2>\n<p>A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting remove radioactivity has the same effect. As usual for poison effects, an affected creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. Remove affliction doesn’t cure a creature of the effects of radiation poisoning, but remove radioactivity does.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a creature has been exposed to enough radiation, it might contract radiation sickness, which acts like a noncontagious disease. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair. Radiation sickness can be treated like any disease, although it can’t be cured with remove affliction.

Prepare: Participants configure their personas and decide </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">whether to be lead or support hackers before accessing </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">the computer.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">2. Present Obstacles: The GM lays out the initial obstacles </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">for the PCs to overcome.

Continued Hacking: After each of the hackers has had a </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">turn, repeat steps 3–5 until the encounter ends.</span></p>\n<p><br />Hacking in the Core Rulebook is straightforward, requiring just a Computers check to access a secured system and avoid countermeasures, sometimes with an additional Computers check to overcome the occasional fake shell or firewall.</p>\n<p>Dynamic hacking involves three key differences. First, a hacking encounter spans multiple phases, during which the hacker can pursue various objectives. Second, a hacker splits their Computers skill into several specializations (Deceive, Hack, and Process), used in place of the Computers modifier during the encounter. Finally, multiple hackers can contribute to dynamic hacking—even PCs with limited technical skills.</p>\n<p>Dynamic hacking functions with existing rules and encounters with minimal adaptation. Rules and guidelines for using this system with existing character options appear on page 73.</p>\n<h2>COMPUTERS SUBSKILLS</h2>\n<p>In dynamic hacking, the Computers skill is broken into three subskills used for various tasks: Deceive, Hack, and Process. <strong>Deceive</strong> represents your ability to hide or misrepresent your identity to avoid detection, confound foes, and trick your way past safeguards. <strong>Hack</strong> represents your prowess to manipulate programs, exploit vulnerabilities, and brute-force your way into a computer’s files. <strong>Process</strong> represents your ability to identify threats and opportunities, as well as change, sustain, defend, or repair your own programs. Your modifier for each of these subskills equals your Computers skill modifier, plus any modifiers based on how you configure your hacking persona (see below).</p>\n<h2>DIGITAL PERSONA</h2>\n<p>While hacking into a computer, you navigate and manipulate its systems through a persona, which is your anchor in that digital world. The persona’s simply a bundle of code through which you act, though you can give it a sensory signature that others perceive when interacting with it. However, your persona is also a target through which others can attack you, track your location, and expel you from the digital space.</p>\n<p><strong>Persona Health:</strong> Countermeasures might attack your persona, degrading its performance or even using the persona to attack you and your equipment more directly. Your persona’s overall health is measured by Connection Points (CP), with lost CP representing damage that impairs performance and connectivity. Your digital persona has a maximum number of CP equal to 12 + 2 × your Computers ranks. You can restore lost CP with the repair action (page 72), and you replenish all lost CP when you spend 1 Resolve Point and take 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>Your persona malfunctions as it loses CP. When your persona’s current CP is at or below 75% of its maximum, randomly select one of your three Computers subskills and apply a –2 penalty to your checks with that subskill. When your persona’s CP is at or below 50% of its maximum, apply that –2 penalty to your checks with the other two subskills. Increase the penalty to –3 when your persona’s CP falls to or below 25% of its maximum. If its CP total ever drops to 0, your persona disintegrates, and you and any support hackers linked to your persona are immediately ejected from the encounter and can’t rejoin until you’ve restored your persona’s current CP to 1 or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuring a Persona:</strong> When you begin a hacking encounter, you configure your persona, assigning a circumstance modifier between –3 and +3 to each of the three subskills: Deceive, Hack, and Process. The sum of these modifiers can’t exceed your number of Computers ranks divided by 3. If you have your own computer (Core Rulebook 213), you can harness its power to enhance your persona, in which case the three circumstance modifiers’ sum above can’t exceed your computer’s tier.</p>\n<p>In addition, you decide whether your persona will act independently or will aid an allied hacker’s persona, establishing whether you are a lead hacker or support hacker.</p>\n<p><em>Lead Hacker:</em> This hacker can perform a major action and a minor action during each phase (action types appear on page 72). In turn, they are vulnerable to countermeasures’ effects. At least one lead hacker must be present to begin a hacking encounter, and any number of lead hackers can participate.</p>\n<p><em>Support Hacker: </em>This hacker’s persona is connected to that of an allied lead hacker. Support hackers are rarely affected directly by countermeasures and can make greater use of non-Computers skills, but they can perform only one minor action each turn. If their lead hacker leaves the encounter, any connected support hackers also leave the encounter.</p>\n<h2>BEGINNING AND ENDING THE ENCOUNTER</h2>\n<p>A hacking encounter begins when one or more users access a secured computer by either directly accessing the computer’s user interface (like a terminal), physically accessing a computer using a hacking kit, or attempting to break into the computer through an infosphere or similar network. Once they begin, the hackers typically work against a timer, as most countermeasures have countdowns that represent how quickly they react to intruders. The encounter continues so long as at least one hacker accesses the computer; however, a GM might end the encounter once a hacker has secured root access or resolved all countermeasures, either of which ends the encounter’s remaining threat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Hacking Phases</strong></h3>\n<p>Much like physical combat, dynamic hacking takes place in phases, during which hackers and automated defenses take turns acting within a digital space. The hackers always act first in a phase, after which the computer’s defenses resolve any of their effects. Each phase, hackers can perform an assortment of actions, including major actions that cause substantial effects and minor actions that focus more on observation, commands, and support. Any lead hacker can perform one major action and one minor action per turn, whereas a support hacker can perform only a minor action per turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus Actions: </strong>At the start of their turn, a hacker can choose to perform additional actions. A lead hacker can choose to take up to three additional major actions during their turn, but they take a cumulative –5 penalty to all skill checks they attempt during their turn for each additional major action taken. A support hacker can choose to take a major action instead of a minor action by spending 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<h2>HACKING OBJECTIVES</h2>\n<p>Objectives represent a combination of goals and obstacles that a hacker overcomes during a hacking encounter. An encounter typically begins with several objectives, and additional objectives appear over the course of the encounter. These objectives are divided into three categories based on their lead function, and sample objectives appear on page 73.</p>\n<p><strong>Countermeasures:</strong> These objectives represent deliberate defenses that pose some risk to hackers. They range from alarms and contingent computer viruses to live counterhackers attempting to stymie intruders.</p>\n<p><strong>Modules:</strong> These objectives are programs that typically have value to the hackers—and are usually the reason for hacking in the first place—such as command modules that control doors or data modules that contain valuable intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Nodes: </strong>These objectives are figurative branches within the computer that provide access to other objectives beyond. Reaching modules often requires traversing one or more nodes.</p>\n<h3>Objective Statistics</h3>\n<p>Objectives typically include a name, a description, and the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Check DC:</strong> This is the base DC of skill checks for interacting with this obstacle. An obstacle’s check DC equals either 15 + 1-1/2 × the encounter’s CR or 15 + 3 × the computer’s tier. Specific checks and actions often include modifiers that adjust this value.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolve: </strong>This lists the way or ways a hacker might overcome the objective. A Resolve entry lists the checks required, the number of successes required for each check, and any modifier to the base DC for those checks. For example, an obstacle with a Check DC of 18 that lists Hack (DC + 0, 2 successes) and Process (DC – 2, 1 success) as its Resolve entry requires two successful DC 18 Hack checks and one successful DC 16 Process check to overcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Support:</strong> This lists any alternate skills a hacker can use when performing the aid action to assist another hacker in overcoming the obstacle.</p>\n<p><strong>Countdown:</strong> This is a timer that triggers special conditions after a certain number of phases, listed in parentheses; some obstacles’ Countdowns are rolled randomly when the obstacle appears. At the end of each hacking phase, reduce this number by 1. If the number is ever reduced to 0, the listed effect occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> This is any special effect that happens once the objective has been resolved.</p>\n<p><strong>Special: </strong>This is any additional effect the obstacle creates.</p>\n<h2>DYNAMIC HACKING ENCOUNTERS</h2>\n<p>Hacking encounters vary to reflect the hackers’ goals and the target computer’s capabilities. Each encounter includes at least one objective tied to the hacker’s goal (such as secret data to steal or a door to open), at least one countermeasure that opposes the hacker, and often, one or more nodes that create avenues the hackers must navigate toward their goals.</p>\n<p>To build an encounter, set the encounter’s Challenge Rating— which sets the encounter’s check DC (page 71)—and decide on an approximate encounter length based on the number of checks required to resolve the key objectives. A short encounter requires about 5–7 successful checks to resolve the main objectives, whereas longer encounters might require 10–15 checks. For each lead hacker involved, add enough countermeasures to increase the number of checks by 2 (for shorter encounters) or by as much as 4 for longer encounters. For each support hacker, increase the number of checks by 1.</p>\n<p>Scaling an encounter in this way need not always involve adding more countermeasures but could instead involve requiring an additional success to resolve specific objectives. This way, even if more PCs join the encounter as lead hackers than you anticipated, you can easily adjust the encounter to provide a fairly similar challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Timed Encounters: </strong>In Starfinder, successfully accessing a system often affords the hacker time to explore at leisure. While a dynamic hack attempt might include finite countermeasures and a clear win condition, the format also supports hackers clashing with an array of defenses that multiply faster than the PCs can deactivate them. In this case, the goal becomes resolving enough countermeasures to stay safe, accomplish the mission, and escape before being overwhelmed or detected.</p>\n<h2>ADAPTING HACKING ABILITIES</h2>\n<p>The following are guidelines for adapting existing class features and character options to the dynamic hacking system.</p>\n<p><strong>Faster Hacking: </strong>An ability that reduces the time it takes to hack instead reduces the penalty a lead hacker takes when performing additional major actions to –3 per additional action.</p>\n<p><strong>Delay Countermeasures: </strong>An ability that would delay a countermeasure’s activation instead increases that countermeasure’s starting countdown value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Negate Countermeasures: </strong>Abilities that would negate a countermeasure entirely instead grant that character a +10 bonus to their first check to resolve the countermeasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> Features that increase the check DC to hack your own computer instead apply their bonus to your checks made to resist any effect that would harm your computer or persona.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Most technology found in settlements can be broken down into the following four categories.</p>\n<h3>Civil</h3>\n<p>Civil technology includes anything installed by a government to be part of an area&rsquo;s infrastructure. Streetlights, public transportation, mail-delivery drones, automated street sweepers, and more make up this category of technology. As a great number of people usually rely on the services this kind of technology provides, it is often better protected. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of civil technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 23.</p>\n<h3>Commercial</h3>\n<p>Commercial technology is often mass-produced and is used by private citizens and most businesses. This category includes personal communication devices, game consoles, most security cameras and electronic door controls, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of commercial technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 18.</p>\n<h3>Restricted</h3>\n<p>Whether owned by the military or a massive corporation, restricted technology is some of the most advanced and hardest to hack. This category includes private servers, weapon prototypes, high-end security systems and alarms, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of restricted technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 30.</p>\n<h3>Custom</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The pervasiveness of technology goes hand in hand with the ability to tweak and alter that technology.

{"_id":"UK3JUtHrP0Wr4hfO","name":"Gravity","content":"<p>CRB pg. 401</p>\n<p>Gravitational differences between planets have the potential to hinder characters or make them superheroes—and sometimes both at the same time. Most planets habitable by humanoids have a gravity level defined as standard, which makes them similar enough that trying to arbitrate the difference isn’t necessary. Others, however, require special consideration. For planets with gravities that aren’t quite standard but don’t fall into the exact categories below, the GM might decide to assume the effects are proportional. For example, a planet with half standard gravity allows player characters to jump twice as high, whereas one with 1-1/2 standard gravity cuts jump heights by a third. In all cases, these effects last until the PCs adjust to the gravity (a process that typically takes about a month of living under such conditions). See Flying on page 259 for information about flying on planets with high or low gravity.</p>\n<h3>Extreme Gravity</h3>\n<p>A planet where the gravity is at least five times as strong as standard gravity is extremely dangerous to most creatures. In addition to the limitations of high gravity (see below), a creature in this environment takes an amount of nonlethal bludgeoning damage per round (at least 1d6, but potentially more, depending on the intensity of the gravity). Once a character takes sufficient nonlethal damage to be reduced to 0 Hit Points, any further damage from extreme gravity is lethal bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<h3>High Gravity</h3>\n<p>On high-gravity worlds, characters are burdened by their increased weight, and their physical abilities are affected accordingly. On a high-gravity world, where the gravity is at least twice as strong as standard gravity, a character (and her gear) weighs twice as much as on a standard-gravity world, but she has the same amount of strength. Such characters move at half speed, can jump only half as high or as far, and can lift only half as much. Thrown weapons (though not those of natives) have their ranges cut in half as they fall to the ground more rapidly. Modifications to running, jumping, and lifting can be negated by certain magic or technology, but projectiles remain affected. Characters who remain in a high-gravity environment for long periods (more than a day) often become fatigued and remain so until they leave the planet or become accustomed to the gravity.</p>\n<h3>Low Gravity</h3>\n<p>Low-gravity worlds are liberating to most species acclimated to standard-gravity worlds. Such characters’ muscles are far more effective than normal. On a low-gravity world, where the gravity is no greater than a third of standard gravity, PCs can jump three times as high and as far and lift three times as much. (Movement speed, however, stays the same, as moving in great bounds is awkward and difficult to control.) Thrown weapons have their range categories tripled.</p>\n<h3>Standard</h3>\n<p>Standard-gravity worlds have gravity approximately the same as that of lost Golarion, which is identical to Earth’s gravity.</p>\n<h3>Zero Gravity</h3>\n<p>Movement in zero gravity (also referred to as zero-g) is not the same as flight. Controlled movement is difficult without some form of propulsion, and creatures without something to push off from often find themselves floating aimlessly. A creature in a zero-gravity environment can’t take move actions to move its speed, crawl, or take a guarded step. If a creature is adjacent to or in the same square as an object (including a wall, floor, or ceiling) or another creature one size category smaller than itself or larger, it can take a move action to push off that object or creature, moving at half its land speed in a direction of its choosing (as appropriate); if that object or creature is movable, it begins moving in the opposite direction at that same speed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving in Zero-G: A creature that moves in a given direction continues to move in that direction at the same speed at the beginning of its turn each round (without taking any action); it must move the full distance unless it is able to change its motion by latching on to an object or creature, pushing off in a new direction, or creating thrust of some kind (all of which are considered move actions). If a creature runs into a solid object during its movement, it must succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check to safely stop its movement; failure means that creature gains the off-kilter condition (see page 276). If a creature runs into another creature during its movement, both creatures must each attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. A creature anchored to a solid object (such as by the boot clamps available with most armor) receives a +4 bonus to this check. An off-kilter creature in a zerogravity environment can steady itself as a move action that requires a surface to grab on to or some method of propulsion; alternatively, that creature can throw a single item weighing at least 4 bulk (for Medium creatures; 2 bulk for Small creatures) to reorient itself and remove the offkilter condition.<br /><br />If provided with sufficient handholds, a creature with a climb speed can move along a wall at full speed, as can any creature that succeeds at a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere, such as wings or turbofans, can’t use their fly speeds in a vacuum; once they reenter an atmosphere, they can recover and get their bearings within 1d4 rounds, after which they can fly normally. Magical flight and methods of flight that provide their own thrust, such as jump jets (see page 206), are not affected. A character in a zero-gravity environment can lift and carry 10 times her normal amount.</li>\n<li>Weapons: Thrown weapons have their range increments multiplied by 10 in zero-g. In addition, all ranged weapons no longer have a maximum number of range increments—their wielders simply continue to accrue penalties the farther away the target is.</li>\n</ul>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Thus, you can speak an amount that makes sense, at the GM’s discretion, without spending any of your actions, even if it isn’t your turn.</p>\n<h2>Delay</h2>\n<p>If you aren’t sure what to do when it’s your turn, you can delay taking an action until other characters have taken their turns. You must declare that you are delaying before taking any actions on your turn (this does not require spending any of your actions). After any creature takes its turn in the initiative order, you can come out of delay and take your turn. This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of the combat. If you used a reaction on your previous turn and then chose to delay, you still regain your reaction at the beginning of your original turn, not when you take your delayed actions.</p>\n<h2>Drop an Item</h2>\n<p>You can drop any item or items that you’re holding into your square or into an adjacent square at any time without spending any actions.</p>\n<h2>Ready an Action</h2>\n<p>You can prepare to take an action when a certain trigger occurs by using a standard action. Decide on a standard, move, or swift action and a trigger. You can take the action you chose when the trigger happens. This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of the combat. If you used a reaction on your previous turn and then chose to ready an action, you still regain your reaction at the beginning of your original turn, not when you take your readied action.</p>\n<p>If your readied action is purely defensive, such as choosing the total defense action if a foe you are facing shoots at you, it occurs just before the event that triggered it. If the readied action is not a purely defensive action, such as shooting a foe if he shoots at you, it takes place immediately after the triggering event. If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again).</p>\n<h2>Use a Skill</h2>\n<p>Like using skills in different circumstances, using a skill in combat usually (but not always) requires taking an action. The action required when using a skill depends on the skill and the specific task you’re trying to accomplish. The skill descriptions in Chapter 5 detail a number of common tasks for each skill and which types of actions they require, if any.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg","name":"Armor","content":"<p><sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 196</span></sub></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor is usually the easiest and most cost-effective way for creatures to protect themselves. Whether you are skimming through space aboard a mercenary vessel, attending a diplomatic meeting on a space station, or descending to a planet&rsquo;s surface to explore, armor provides you with protection against attacks and hostile environments.<br /><br />Modern armor is made of many different substances, including carbon fiber, ceramic, fabric, metal, and polymers. Most are constructed from a combination of materials, and some even use archaic materials such as animal hide. Creatures wear armor to protect themselves, but also to express their personal style.<br /><br />Most suits of armor consist of a helmet, gloves, boots, and a bodysuit that offers head-to-toe protection. Unless otherwise specified, the boots include a functionality that can anchor your feet to a solid surface in a zero-gravity environment, allowing you to orient yourself or return to normal footing when needed (for more about moving in zero-g, see page 402). </span></p>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Wearing Armor</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A character&rsquo;s class and feats determine what kinds of armor they can wear. Further details about wearing armor are below. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you are wearing armor with which you are not proficient, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to both EAC and KAC (see page 240). A character who is proficient only with light armor can wear heavier armor effectively by selecting the Heavy Armor Proficiency feat. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Donning Armor</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The time required to don or remove armor depends on its type. Light armor requires 4 rounds to don or remove, while heavy armor requires 16 rounds to don or remove.<br /><br />Armor that is at least 8th level but less than 16th level takes half the normal time to don or remove. Armor of 16th level or higher takes one-quarter the normal time to don or remove, to a minimum of one full action.<br /><br />Modern suits of armor are designed so that you can don or remove armor without assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Don Hastily</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You can hastily don armor in half the normal time, to a minimum of one full action. The armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 worse than normal. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Armor Size</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor comes in different sizes for different creatures, and you might have to adjust a suit of armor to fit you if it wasn&rsquo;t made for your race. A ysoki can&rsquo;t effectively wear armor made for a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}, and a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} needs to adjust armor that was made for a two-armed creature. If it&rsquo;s in doubt whether a creature can fit the suit, the GM decides whether the armor needs to be adjusted. When you buy armor new, the purchase price includes any adjustments. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Adjusting Armor</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you get secondhand armor that wasn&rsquo;t tailored for you, you can have it adjusted, which requires a successful Engineering check (DC = 10 + 2 &times; the armor&rsquo;s level). Alternatively, you can spend 10% of the armor&rsquo;s purchase price to have it adjusted by a professional&mdash;typically an armorsmith or anyone with multiple ranks in Engineering. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Environmental Protections</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all armors protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor force field specially attuned to pressure and temperature that does not reduce damage from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals. The most common environmental dangers are detailed in Environment beginning on page 394. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Activation and Duration</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A suit of armor&rsquo;s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to its item level. Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes a standard action if you are wearing the suit (assuming the armor was properly donned). If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a helpless creature, you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action, but turning it off requires a Computers check to hack the system, treating the suit as a computer with a tier equal to half the suit&rsquo;s item level (the base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier).<br /><br />The duration of a suit&rsquo;s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an environment recharging station (publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of the recharging stations that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells (see page 234), also recharge armor&rsquo;s environmental protections, and using them to recharge suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no duration remaining still work normally. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Breathing and Pressure</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">All armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres (including any airborne poison or @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a corrosive atmosphere (see page 395) to prevent suffocation, but it isn&rsquo;t strong enough to prevent a corrosive atmosphere from dealing acid damage to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid damage taken from a corrosive atmosphere normally. Any vision impairment from the environment (such as smoke or water) still applies. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Radiation</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor protects you against low levels of radiation (see page 403) and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. Armor of 7th level and higher grants immunity to medium radiation levels and provides a +6 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. No armor&rsquo;s bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that caused you to contract it. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Temperature</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor&rsquo;s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both cold (temperatures as low as &ndash;20&deg; F) and heat (temperatures as high as 140&deg; F). This prevents you from having to attempt most Fortitude saving throws to avoid damage from the environment, and it prevents you from taking damage from breathing in most environments. This does not protect against cold or fire damage from other sources or against environments that deal damage without allowing a Fortitude saving throw or breathing the atmosphere (such as lava).)</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"XXFVHgn8CM2fAYWp","name":"Aquatic Terrain","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 396</p>\n<p>Aquatic terrain can be one of the least hospitable to PCs because most can’t breathe underwater. The ocean floor holds many marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the other terrain elements described in this chapter, but if characters find themselves in the water because they were bull-rushed off the back of a transport ship, the kelp beds or volcanic vents hundreds of feet below them don’t matter. The most common rules sections to reference when using aquatic terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404) and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.gZ8wUsXvIqlFxTpp]{Underwater Combat} (see page 405). The rules for swimming with the @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.HsCWctv7usPI6Gvd]{Athletics} skill (see page 137) are also critical for many creatures operating in an aquatic environment.</p>\n<h3>Deep Water</h3>\n<p>Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Athletics checks to move through (typically, DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water, and DC 30 in maelstrom water). Characters need a way to breathe if they’re underwater; lacking that, they risk drowning. When underwater, characters can move in any direction, including up and down.</p>\n<h3>Extreme Depths</h3>\n<p>At certain depths, the pressure of the surrounding water becomes so great that characters might be affected as if they were in a thick or severely thick atmosphere (see page 396), even if they can breathe underwater.</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection Underwater</h3>\n<p>How far a character can see underwater depends on the water’s clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8×100 feet if the water is clear and 1d8×10 feet in murky water. Running water is always murky, unless it’s in a particularly large, slow-moving river. It is hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the sea floor).</p>\n<h2>Expanded Aquatic Rules</h2>\n<p><sup>Source: AP #36 pg. 47</sup></p>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GjzGvCOqijA3OZOD]{Surviving Underwater}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.hNAwujsKAB9KxFYb]{Underwater Movement}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.YYQn77To3lKzdjhk]{Underwater Combat (Expanded)}</h3>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

This type of terrain can occur in any other biome. Mountains are steeply rising rock, metal, or even the organic crust of the planet. The most common rules sections to reference when using hill and mountain terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.q9EhH1XBLFoM4aNG]{Cold Dangers} (see page 400), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y]{Falling} (see page 400), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see page 398).</p>\n<h3>Chasms</h3>\n<p>Usually formed by natural geological processes, chasms are common dangers in mountainous areas. Chasms aren’t hidden, so characters won’t (usually) fall into them by accident. A typical chasm is 2d4×10 feet deep, at least 20 feet long, and anywhere from 5 to 20 feet wide. It usually requires a successful DC 15 Athletics check to climb the wall of a chasm. In mountain terrain, chasms are typically 2d8×10 feet deep.</p>\n<h3>Rock Wall</h3>\n<p>A vertical plane of stone, a rock wall requires one or more successful DC 25 Athletics checks to ascend. A typical rock wall is from 2d4×10 feet tall to 2d8×10 feet tall.</p>\n<h3>High Altitude</h3>\n<p>At particularly high altitudes, the thinning atmosphere poses a challenge for many creatures, with the same effects as a thin atmosphere (see page 396). A creature residing at a high altitude for 1 month becomes acclimated and no longer takes these penalties, but it loses this benefit if it spends more than 2 months away from high-altitude terrain and must reacclimatize upon returning.</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In Hills And Mountains</h3>\n<p>As a guideline, the maximum distance in mountain terrain at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 4d10×10 feet. In hill terrain, the maximum distance is 2d10×10 feet. It’s easier to hear distant sounds in the mountains. The DCs of Perception checks that rely on sound are usually lower at the GM’s discretion.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"Y0iOmLxszsGz6Q6l","name":"Vision and Light","content":"<p>CRB pg. 261</p>\n<p>Because the majority of creatures in the Starfinder RPG use vision as their only precise sense, it’s important to determine the limitations of vision.</p>\n<h3>Bright Light</h3>\n<p>All characters with vision can see clearly in bright light. Sources of bright light include direct sunlight outdoors, a nearby star shining through a starship viewport, powerful industrial lighting, or any source as bright or brighter than normal sunlight.</p>\n<h3>Normal Light</h3>\n<p>Normal light functions just like bright light, but it is less intense. Normal light includes the light conditions underneath a forest canopy during the day, typical indoor lighting, typical lighting on a starship, or the light shed by a star shaman’s starlight form.</p>\n<h3>Dim Light</h3>\n<p>In dim light, you can somewhat make out shapes, but you can’t see precise details well at all. Dim light includes moonlight outside at night and bright starlight, or a starship’s emergency backup lights. An area just beyond the range of a light source has dim light. Creatures within an area of dim light have concealment (20% miss chance; see page 253) from creatures without darkvision or the ability to see in darkness. Because dim light is not ideal for observation, if you’re in an area of dim light, you can attempt a Stealth check to conceal yourself from creatures without low-light vision, darkvision, or blindsight. Dim light does not affect creatures with low-light vision, which can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>\n<h3>Darkness</h3>\n<p>In darkness, creatures without darkvision effectively have the blinded condition (see page 273). Areas of darkness include an unlit chamber within a structure, most caverns, outside on a moonless night, or the surface of planets with distant or nonexistent stars. Unlike low-light vision and in areas of dim light, darkvision does not work exactly like normal vision in areas of darkness; rather, darkvision works only to a specified range and is in black and white.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

The following adjustments apply whenever a character walks in chest-deep water, becomes fully submerged, or traverses along the bottom of a body of water.<br /><br /><strong>Attacks:</strong> Attacks made underwater take a –2 penalty. Attacks that deal electricity damage take a –4 penalty instead of a –2 penalty.<br /><br /><strong>Attacks from above Water:</strong> Characters have cover against attacks originating from above water in the following situations: characters are fully immersed, or they’re swimming or floating at least chest-deep in water.<br /><br /><strong>Thrown Weapons:</strong> When used underwater, the range of thrown weapons is reduced to a maximum of 5 feet; this limitation overrides any abilities that normally increase a thrown weapon’s range or range increment (such as the grenade expert ability of the soldier’s bombard fighting style).<br /><br /><strong>Damage:</strong> Most attacks underwater deal half damage (minimum 1 damage). However, melee attacks that deal piercing damage deal full damage, and any attacks that deal fire damage (including spells that deal fire damage) do one-quarter damage rather than half damage.<br /><br /><strong>Combat Maneuvers:</strong> The distance you move a target with a successful bull rush is reduced by 5 feet. The trip combat maneuver has no effect underwater.<br /><br /><strong>Burning Condition:</strong> Effects that would apply the burning condition (such as the burn critical hit effect) instead deal the damage listed for the condition only once (the normal underwater reduction for fire damage still applies; see Damage above), and the creature doesn’t receive the burning condition.<br /><br /><strong>Spells:</strong> Some spells work differently underwater, either as stated in their spell description or per the GM’s discretion. Spells with the fire descriptor often function differently when used underwater.<br /><br /><strong>Prone:</strong> Creatures swimming in water can drop prone only if they’re standing on the bottom of a body of water. If a creature underwater would be knocked prone by an effect, it instead gains the flat-footed condition and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. These effects last until the affected creature takes a move action to reorient itself.<br /><br /><strong>Stealth and Detection:</strong> It can be hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the seafloor). How far a character can see underwater depends on the water’s clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8 × 100 feet if the water is clear and 1d8 × 10 feet in murky water.

Taking a drug also exposes the user to the addiction disease (see page 418), with a DC that depends on how addictive the drug is. If a character is dosed with a drug against his will, he can attempt a Fortitude save against the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug}&rsquo;s DC. If he succeeds, this negates both the drug&rsquo;s beneficial and negative effects, as well the chance for addiction.

{"_id":"dXoXgaKcx2ZfBD4M","name":"Vehicle Tactical Rules","content":"<p><sub>Source CRB&nbsp; pg. 278</sub></p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in a vehicle fleeing from enemies who are on foot, or you&rsquo;re on foot yourselves trying to stop a vehicle, movement and combat are represented on a grid, such as a battle map. Different rules apply to chases between vehicles, since they involve much greater distances (see page 282).<br /><br />Vehicles are objects, so they don&rsquo;t have actions or reactions of their own&mdash;they must be piloted by a character or an AI autopilot (see page 280). However, they might still move when uncontrolled (see page 280). In some cases, a vehicle&rsquo;s item level affects the DC of the pilot&rsquo;s or passengers&rsquo; skill checks or otherwise factors into how these rules work. See pages 228&ndash;229 for the statistics of specific vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Vehicle Heading</h1>\n<p>Which direction creatures are facing on a grid is generally irrelevant in Starfinder, but vehicles aren&rsquo;t as nimble, so you need to monitor a vehicle&rsquo;s heading each time it moves. If you&rsquo;re using miniatures, rotate the vehicle&rsquo;s miniature to face the correct direction whenever its heading changes. The vehicle has to face toward one of the edges of its space, not toward a corner.<br /><br />When a vehicle has to move at its current heading (such as during a race action or when uncontrolled), it has to move in a straight line. This line is measured from the center of the vehicle on its front edge, and it can be straight ahead or at an angle, as shown in the diagram on page 279. The angle can&rsquo;t be greater than 45 degrees diagonally from the heading.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Piloting a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re piloting a vehicle during a combat on a grid, the vehicle moves on your initiative count and you have to spend your actions to pilot it. Creatures can take the following actions to drive or interact with vehicles, in addition to the normal combat actions described earlier in this chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Move Actions</h2>\n<p>It takes a move action to board, drive, start, abruptly stop, or take control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Board or Disembark from a Vehicle</h3>\n<p>You can board or disembark from a vehicle as a move action. Doing so while the vehicle is in motion requires a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check; see Boarding on page 285.</p>\n<h3>Drive</h3>\n<p>You can pilot a vehicle at its drive speed, which is noted in the Speed entry of the vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) as a move action. You can turn as needed throughout that movement, and you set your heading at the end of the drive action.<br /><br />Vehicles provoke attacks of opportunity while driving, and when you are in a vehicle that&rsquo;s driving, you similarly provoke attacks of opportunity if you take any actions that would normally do so (including making ranged attacks) unless the vehicle provides total cover. You can&rsquo;t use the drive action to move a vehicle through spaces occupied by creatures, even if they&rsquo;re allies.</p>\n<h3>Start Vehicle</h3>\n<p>Firing the ignition of a vehicle is typically a move action, though more complicated vehicles might have a multistage startup sequence requiring multiple actions.</p>\n<h3>Stop Short</h3>\n<p>Stopping a vehicle after a race action (see Race below) requires a move action (stopping after a drive action doesn&rsquo;t require an action; see Not an Action on page 280). Normally, a vehicle continues to move following a race action. You can attempt a Piloting check (see Pilot a Vehicle on page 146) to reduce the distance your vehicle moves before stopping after a race action by the result of your check, rounded down to the next 5-foot increment. For example, with a result of 17 you would reduce the distance moved by 15 feet (3 squares).</p>\n<h3>Take Control</h3>\n<p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action. See Uncontrolled Vehicles on page 280 for more information about taking control of an uncontrolled vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Full Actions</h2>\n<p>Speed along in a straight line or attacking with the body of a vehicle takes a full action, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Race</h3>\n<p>When making a race action, you pilot a vehicle at full speed in a straight line at its current heading using a full action. You must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + your vehicle&rsquo;s item level) to race. If your vehicle is starting from a dead stop (that is, it didn&rsquo;t move last round), the DC of the check increases by 5.<br /><br />If you fail this Piloting check, the vehicle&rsquo;s behavior depends on the circumstances of the check and the surrounding terrain. If you were attempting to race from a dead stop, the vehicle stalls and doesn&rsquo;t move at all. If the vehicle was already moving, its behavior depends on the terrain. Rough terrain slows the vehicle, causing it to move at half its full speed at its current heading. On flat terrain, the vehicle usually moves at full speed but goes significantly off course. In this case, the GM should take the 180-degree arc in front of the vehicle and divide it into four equal 45-degree arcs. Then the GM randomly determines which of these arcs the vehicle moves into.<br /><br />A vehicle can&rsquo;t safely race through difficult terrain or over obstacles unless outfitted with special gear, nor can it safely race to a destination you can&rsquo;t see unless you&rsquo;ve thoroughly scanned the destination. If you force a vehicle to race unsafely, you must attempt a Piloting check at a DC determined by the GM (usually 20 + the vehicle&rsquo;s item level) when you encounter the difficult terrain or obstacle. If you fail or the vehicle is uncontrolled (see page 280), the vehicle crashes or spins out, as determined by the GM.<br /><br />After taking a race action, a vehicle doesn&rsquo;t slow down immediately. On your next turn, you have four options: you can use another full action to continue to race at full speed, use a move action to drive at the vehicle&rsquo;s drive speed, use a move action to stop short, or relinquish control of the vehicle as a swift action. If you take a swift or move action, you can also take a standard action during that turn. For instance, you could race one turn, then on your next turn, you could fire a weapon as a standard action and then drive as your move action.<br /><br />A racing vehicle provokes attacks of opportunity, but it gets a +2 bonus to its AC against them due to its speed.<br /><br />Many vehicles have extremely high full speeds compared to creatures&rsquo; speeds, so racing at full speed is often tantamount to exiting a battle entirely, unless other vehicles get involved.</p>\n<h3>Ram</h3>\n<p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to its full speed in a straight line at its current heading and try to ram one creature or object at the end of the movement, dealing double the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to the target and half the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to your vehicle. A vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see page 228).<br /><br />Movement during a ram action has all the same restrictions as the race action and requires the same Piloting checks. If you fail any Piloting check during the movement, you fail to ram your target.<br /><br />If the target of the ram action is a creature, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the vehicle&rsquo;s collision DC to avoid being hit. If the target of the ram action is another vehicle, the pilot of the defending vehicle can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit, with a DC equal to the result of your Piloting check. The attacker wins ties.</p>\n<h3>Run Over</h3>\n<p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to double its drive speed and run over any creatures at least two size categories smaller than the vehicle during this movement. Those creatures take bludgeoning damage equal to the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage, but can each attempt a Reflex save against the vehicle&rsquo;s collision DC to take half damage. Roll the damage only once and apply it to each creature, rather than rolling separately for each. A vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see Vehicles on page 228).<br /><br />When you take a run over action, the vehicle takes damage equal to half the damage rolled for each creature it runs over. If the vehicle becomes unable to proceed due to this damage, it ceases moving. You can still set the vehicle&rsquo;s heading at the end of this movement as normal.<br /><br />A vehicle taking the run over action can damage a creature no more than once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. The vehicle can run over objects of the appropriate size with the same effects, though they don&rsquo;t receive saving throws unless they are piloted or otherwise animate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Swift Actions</h2>\n<p>It takes a swift action to engage or disengage a vehicle&rsquo;s autocontrol or autopilot or to relinquish control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Engage or Disengage Autocontrol</h3>\n<p>You can engage a vehicle&rsquo;s autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action. You can disengage its autocontrol as a swift action anytime. See Autocontrol below for more.</p>\n<h3>Engage or Disengage Autopilot</h3>\n<p>You can engage a vehicle&rsquo;s autopilot as a swift action (see Autopilot below).</p>\n<h3>Relinquish Control</h3>\n<p>You can voluntarily hand over control of a vehicle to another pilot as a swift action. If you relinquish control of a vehicle but another pilot does not take over control, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled (see Uncontrolled Vehicles below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Not an Action</h2>\n<p>The following does not require an action.</p>\n<h3>Stop</h3>\n<p>You can stop a vehicle after a drive action without difficulty and without spending an action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Uncontrolled Vehicles</h1>\n<p>If you are knocked out or cease actively piloting, your vehicle becomes uncontrolled. If you delay your action, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled and continues to act on the same initiative count as it did before. This separates your initiative count from that of the vehicle, and the vehicle continues to move (see below) at your previous initiative count until a pilot takes control of it or it crashes or otherwise is brought to a definitive halt.<br /><br />Unless otherwise specified, an uncontrolled vehicle moves straight ahead at its most recent heading as if taking two drive actions on its turn. It slows down incrementally with each action taken (usually to three-quarters the speed of its last action) until it comes to a stop or crashes. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, it could slow down more if it&rsquo;s on uneven terrain or an upward slope, or it could stay at the same speed or even accelerate if it&rsquo;s in a zero-g environment or on a downward slope.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Taking Control</h2>\n<p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action (see Take Control on page 278). During this move action, the vehicle doesn&rsquo;t move any additional distance&mdash;you spend the whole action taking control. Once the action is taken, the vehicle resets to your initiative count, and you can spend any remaining actions piloting the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crashing</h2>\n<p>If an uncontrolled vehicle runs into an obstacle or another vehicle, it crashes. This deals double the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to the uncontrolled vehicle and to the obstacle it ran into, and stops the uncontrolled vehicle&rsquo;s progress. If the uncontrolled vehicle crashes into a controlled vehicle, the other pilot can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit as if it were being rammed (see Ram on page 279). If that pilot avoids being hit, the uncontrolled vehicle continues to move as detailed in Uncontrolled Vehicles above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Autocontrol</h1>\n<p>Some vehicles have autocontrol, which enables you to spend your actions on tasks other than piloting, but is far less capable than an autopilot. You can engage autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action, and it lasts until it is disengaged (also a swift action) or until the vehicle is no longer capable of moving. When you&rsquo;re using autocontrol, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled, but each round it moves in a straight line for the same distance and at the same heading and speed as the last pilot action (moving as if taking two drive actions if drive was the last action the pilot took, or as a race action if that was the last action the pilot took). The autocontrol uses the result of the pilot&rsquo;s most recent Piloting check as the result of its Piloting checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Autopilot</h1>\n<p>Some vehicles have an autopilot AI that can control the vehicle in place of an actual pilot. You can engage or disengage an autopilot as a swift action. You can input a destination into an autopilot as a move action, and the autopilot attempts to reach that location if doing so is possible (provided the autopilot isn&rsquo;t locked by a passcode or otherwise programmed not to obey).<br /><br />A vehicle is considered controlled when the autopilot is engaged. An autopilot&rsquo;s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br /><br />The Systems entry in a vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) lists the autopilot&rsquo;s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle&rsquo;s modifier (listed in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Attacking from a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>Anyone attacking while on a vehicle takes that vehicle&rsquo;s penalty to attack rolls, as listed in the Modifiers entry of the vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228). It&rsquo;s especially difficult to attack from a vehicle that&rsquo;s moving at high speed, so a vehicle might have a higher modifier on attacks (shown in parentheses) when traveling at full speed. The penalty for moving at full speed applies if the vehicle moved at full speed during the last round. The attack penalty doesn&rsquo;t apply when the vehicle is stopped.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Firing Vehicle Weapons</h2>\n<p>Firing a weapon mounted on a vehicle works like firing a normal ranged weapon, but you must activate the vehicle&rsquo;s weapons instead of ones you hold. The penalties to attack rolls in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry also apply to attacks made with a vehicle&rsquo;s weapons.<br /><br />Some vehicles have weapons bound to their steering devices or weapons that are operated from the same control panel. These can be fired when you are piloting, though you normally can&rsquo;t fire the vehicle&rsquo;s weapons on the same turn that you race (or on the same turn that you take another full action) because you don&rsquo;t have enough available actions. Weapons mounted in other manners typically need to be fired by creatures on the vehicle that are dedicated gunners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Drive-By Attacks</h2>\n<p>Because many vehicles have full speeds that might let them move across an entire battle map, the GM may need to make a judgment call when vehicles leave the map and want to return. The GM determines how long returning takes, but it normally takes at least 1 round to double back, since it takes a move action to drive and change heading.<br /><br />In theory, creatures could pile on a vehicle, ready actions to shoot enemies as soon as they&rsquo;re within 30 feet, race the vehicle across the map, and fire in passing. Such a maneuver might seem like a sure thing, but it comes with a few problems. First, the attackers take a big penalty to all their attacks, but enemies who ready actions to fire back don&rsquo;t take those penalties. Second, enemies have time to prepare while the vehicle is off the map. They might take cover, set up obstacles to prevent the vehicle from racing through, or just leave. The GM might also rule that the attackers can&rsquo;t keep a good watch on what&rsquo;s happening while they&rsquo;re off the map or that the vehicle breaks down after the stress of using such a tactic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Escaping on a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>Because vehicles have a top speed that&rsquo;s far faster than most creatures can run, creatures in a vehicle can usually escape from a battle with enemies who are on foot, if they want. The GM has final say on whether a vehicle can escape. Usually, once a vehicle is beyond the range that the enemies on foot can run, those enemies get one more volley of attacks, and then the vehicle and everyone on it escapes. However, if the enemies also board a vehicle, they can usually pursue and the battle transitions to a vehicle chase (see page 282).</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"dtLCJ0nodTp5UwR5","name":"Aerial Terrain","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 396</p>\n<p>On worlds where the atmosphere expands high above the physical boundaries of the surface, there exists a region of open air. Similarly, gas giants are made up of nothing more than a vast atmosphere, held in place by a starlike core. The most common rules sections to reference when using aerial terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y]{Falling} (see page 400), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.UK3JUtHrP0Wr4hfO]{Gravity} (see page 401), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see page 398). The rules for flying with the @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.6by4xbwlnTJWmiOG]{Acrobatics} skill are also critical for many creatures operating in an aerial environment.</p>\n<h3>Clouds</h3>\n<p>Most clouds are little more than condensed gas that obfuscates vision. Treat a cloud in an aerial environment using the same rules as fog cloud, except it’s a nonmagical effect. Other types of cloud exist, such as corrosive or toxic clouds, which operate in the same manner as those types of atmospheres (see above).</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In Aerial Terrain</h3>\n<p>How far a character can see in the air depends on the presence or absence of clouds. Creatures can usually see 5d8×100 feet if the sky is completely clear, with minimal clouds (or other aerial objects) blocking their views. Clouds generally provide enough concealment to hide within (though the hiding creature might have difficulty seeing out from its hiding place).</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"hNAwujsKAB9KxFYb","name":"Underwater Movement","content":"<p>Related Rules: @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.XXFVHgn8CM2fAYWp]{Aquatic Terrain}</p>\n<p>Source: AP #36 pg. 47</p>\n<p>Moving underwater can prove difficult for land-based creatures that don’t have a natural swim speed. Those with swim speeds (whether from their species, gear, magic, or some other effect) have distinct advantages.</p>\n<h2>Swimming Without a Swim Speed</h2>\n<p>A creature that takes a move action to move its speed while underwater must choose a direction to swim (including up or down) and attempt an Athletics check to swim. The DC of this check is 10 in calm water but increases in rough conditions (DC 15), stormy conditions (DC 20), and maelstrom conditions (DC 30). Strong currents, debris, and other environmental conditions can increase this DC further. A creature can’t take 10 to swim in combat or in stormy or maelstrom conditions, even if not distracted or in immediate danger.<br /><br />On a successful check to swim, the creature moves half its land speed in a straight line in its chosen direction. If the creature wants to change direction (including ascending or descending) while swimming, it costs an additional 5 feet of movement to turn 45 degrees. See the Swimming Example below for an example of a creature swimming and changing direction.<br /><br />If a creature fails a check to swim by 4 or less, it makes no progress. If it fails by 5 or more, it sinks, moving 5 feet directly downward.<br /><br />Every hour while swimming, a creature without a swim speed must succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check or take 1d6 nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>\n<h2>Swimming Example</h2>\n<p>Suppose a creature has a swim speed of 30 feet. With a successful check to swim (if required), it can swim forward 5 feet, turn 45 degrees to the left, and swim 5 feet diagonally, all of which costs a total of 15 feet of its movement. The creature can then turn 90 degrees to ascend 5 feet straight up, which costs another 15 feet of movement (10 feet to change its direction and 5 feet to move). At this point, it has used its 30 feet of swimming movement, so its move action ends.</p>\n<h2>Swimming With A Swim Speed</h2>\n<p>If a creature has a swim speed (whether from its species or another source), it can move that full swim speed when it takes a move action to move its speed. This movement uses the same rules presented in the Swimming Example below, which also provides an example of a creature swimming and changing direction.<br /><br />A creature with a swim speed doesn’t need to attempt an Athletics check to swim except in hazardous circumstances, including stormy and maelstrom conditions. It also gains a +8 bonus to Athletics checks to swim and can always take 10 while swimming, even during combat and when distracted or in immediate danger. Creatures with a swim speed can also use the run action while swimming, provided that they swim in a straight line.<br /><br />A creature with a swim speed (such as from their species) doesn’t need to attempt an Athletics check to avoid fatigue damage for each hour it swims.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"jsBYiuZsX63Pz2fD","name":"Full Actions","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL]{Actions in Combat}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 248</p>\n<p>A full action requires your entire turn to complete. If you take a full action, you can’t take your usual standard, move, and swift actions. The following actions are full actions.</p>\n<h2>Charge</h2>\n<p>Charging is a full action that allows you to move up to double your speed and make a melee attack at the end of the movement. You can draw a weapon during a charge attack if your base attack bonus is at least +1.</p>\n<p>Charging carries tight restrictions on how you can move. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares), and all movement must be directly toward the designated opponent, though diagonal movement is allowed. You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and you must move to the space closest to your starting square from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or blocked, you can’t charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement (such as difficult terrain), or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. You can still move through helpless creatures during a charge. If you don’t have line of sight (see page 271) to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacking on a Charge: </strong>After moving, you can make a single melee attack. You take a –2 penalty to the attack roll and a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. You can’t move any farther after the attack. Some classes, including solarian and soldier, grant abilities that modify attacks made on charges.</p>\n<h2>Coup de Grace</h2>\n<p>As a full action, you can deliver a special attack called a coup de grace to an adjacent helpless opponent. You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the target survives the damage, he must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your level or CR) or die. However, if the target is immune to critical hits, the coup de grace does not deal critical damage or effects, nor does it force the target to succeed at a saving throw or die.</p>\n<h2>Fight Defensively</h2>\n<p>You can fight defensively when attacking as a full action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty to all attacks in that round (in addition to the normal penalties for making a full attack) to gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Full Attack</h2>\n<p>You can spend a full action to make two attacks, each with a –4 penalty to the attack rolls. These attacks can be made with the same weapon or different weapons, though certain weapons have a firing speed so slow that you can’t shoot them more than once in a round, even with a full attack. These weapons have the unwieldy special property (see page 182).</p>\n<p>Certain weapons have special individualized full attacks. For instance, some weapons have a fully automatic attack mode. Sometimes special full attacks, such as the soldier’s onslaught class feature, require specialized training in order to gain their benefits.</p>\n<h2>Run</h2>\n<p>You can run as a full action. When you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight line. You gain the flat-footed condition, and you can’t run if you must cross difficult terrain or can’t see where you’re going. Running provokes attacks of opportunity (see below). You can run for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score. See page 258 for information on long-distance running.</p>\n<h2>Withdraw</h2>\n<p>Withdrawing from melee combat is a full action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies don’t get to make attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that square. Unseen enemies still get attacks of opportunity against you, and you can’t withdraw from combat if you’re blinded and have no other precise senses (such as blindsight). If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square other than the one you in which started, enemies can make attacks of opportunity as normal. See Attack of Opportunity below for more information.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"l0itG6wAC0T0JnAX","name":"Marsh Terrain","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 396</p>\n<p>Two categories of marsh exist: relatively dry moors and watery swamps. Both are often bordered by lakes (see page 396), which are effectively a third category of terrain found in marshes. The most common rules sections to reference for marshes and swamps are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.gZ8wUsXvIqlFxTpp]{Underwater Combat} (see page 405), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see below).</p>\n<h3>Bogs</h3>\n<p>If a square is part of a shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1 foot in depth. It counts as difficult terrain, and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted in such a square increase by 2.<br /><br />A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It counts as difficult terrain, and Medium or larger creatures must spend 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.<br /><br />The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover. Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved cover. A creature with this improved cover takes a –10 penalty to attacks against creatures that aren’t underwater.<br /><br />Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares.</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In A Marsh</h3>\n<p>In a moor, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 6d6×10 feet. In a swamp, this distance is 2d8×10 feet. Vegetation and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment (20% miss chance), so it is possible to use Stealth to hide in a marsh.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"mlumM1BnrOQO3N7E","name":"Galactic Trade","content":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><sub>Source AP #34&nbsp; pg. 50</sub></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The life of an independent trader isn&rsquo;t an easy one. On paper, the career seems simple: get a ship, get a crew, get cargo, get paid. In reality, nothing ever seems to go as planned&mdash;starships break down or get scorched in firefights, a journey through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} turns out far more dangerous than expected, and sellers overcharge while buyers haggle down. But the prospect of danger and uncertainty makes for an exciting Starfinder campaign! The following optional rules provide a new way to structure a campaign around a PC crew of independent merchants flying a starship of their own while buying, moving, and selling cargo in the Pact Worlds, Near Space, and the Vast.<br /><br />During the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path, the PCs take control of their professional destinies to work as freelance traders and troubleshooters. The rules presented in this article are designed to simulate part of that lifestyle, and you can use them in almost any campaign, especially a sandbox-style one.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Alternative Build Points</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">These new rules focus on altering the way PCs can obtain Build Points (BP) for building and upgrading starships. In the normal rules, Build Points are a pool that constantly increases as the PCs level up, but in this subsystem, Build Points become a form of currency. The PCs spend BP to buy a starship and cargo, and they earn BP whenever they make a sale.<br /><br />The PCs&rsquo; starship becomes an investment like any other piece of equipment, but bought with BP instead of credits. As the PCs complete jobs, they get more Build Points to spend on upgrading their starship. They can do so gradually, installing one new system at a time, or they can hoard BP and then spend them all at once. However, the PCs should always keep some BP on hand to buy the cargo for their next job. If the PCs&rsquo; ship is destroyed, they also lose the BP they invested in it! (Many crews insure their starships for just this eventuality; see page 54 for details.) But if the PCs&rsquo; business flourishes, they&rsquo;ll find themselves living in the lap of luxury, hiring additional employees, or even buying a second starship to ply the interstellar trade routes.<br /><br />The Starfinder Core Rulebook includes some guidelines for how PCs can acquire the BP they need to build and upgrade their first starship&mdash;via salvage, favors, or an arrangement with a friendly spacedock, for instance. In this case, Build Points represent much more than simple credits and become exclusively useful through the starship creation system, staying separate from the methods by which PCs buy their personal equipment. This separation provides an important distinction because if PCs had the ability to exchange Build Points for credits, they could end up underpowered in starship combat while simultaneously overpowered in all their other encounters.<br /><br />In the rules presented here, Build Points roughly represent the party&rsquo;s business capital. That capital has many components, including the PCs&rsquo; available credit, loans they&rsquo;ve taken out, and assets they might use as collateral. PCs use this capital to make big purchases, like cargo or starship modifications, often with financing help from a bank or other establishment.<br /><br />To begin, the PCs receive a number of Build Points determined by their Average Party Level (APL) as noted in Table 9&ndash;1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. They should use this BP to build their starship; you might want to remind the PCs that their vessel needs plenty of room for cargo and that they&rsquo;ll have to spend a few BP to purchase that cargo. (The PCs in &ldquo;We&rsquo;re No Heroes&rdquo; receive a prebuilt starship and earn a few extra BP by the end of the adventure.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Galactic Trade Basics</h1>\n<p>The PCs will earn most of their Build Points by hauling cargo from one world to another. See Running the System on page 55 for other ways the PCs can receive BP.<br /><br />A cargo job boils down into several steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find Cargo: The PCs find cargo. Determine the cargo&rsquo;s type, the price to buy it, its destination (if any), and how much it might sell for.</li>\n<li>Determine Complication: Most jobs have a unique complicating factor, which you determine in secret when the PCs find their cargo.</li>\n<li>Transport: The PCs take the cargo to its destination or to a world where they hope to sell it.</li>\n<li>Make the Sale: The PCs deliver the cargo to its intended recipient or try to find a buyer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Find Cargo</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cargo in the Starfinder setting is standardized into lots, each massing 25 tons. A single lot of cargo fits into one of a starship&rsquo;s cargo holds, so the PCs can transport a number of lots equal to the number of cargo holds on their vessel. Finding cargo to buy is a downtime activity as detailed in the sidebar on page 52. For more on downtime activities, see page 150 of the Starfinder Character Operations Manual.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cargo Type</h3>\n<p>When the PCs successfully find cargo to purchase, you determine the type of cargo, usually to match the needs of your campaign. Alternatively, you can randomly determine the type of cargo by rolling a d20 on the table below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 1d20]]</td>\n<td>CARGO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Art or antiques</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Base metals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Ceramics or glassware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Chemicals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Furniture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Hides or leather</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Live animals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Machinery or electronics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Minerals or byproducts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Paper products or books</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Plastics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Precision equipment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Precious metals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Prepared food</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Textiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Toys or games</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Vegetable products</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Vehicles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Weapons or ammo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Wood</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Find Cargo</h3>\n<p>You look for suitable cargo to purchase with the hopes of selling it elsewhere.<br /><br />Activity: You spend the day searching the infosphere, talking with contacts, and visiting warehouses or the local starport. You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find cargo in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your character level). You take a cumulative &ndash;1 penalty to this roll for every find cargo activity you or your allies have previously attempted in this settlement within the last week.<br /><br />Results: On a success, you find 1d4 lots of cargo that you can buy. The cargo can&rsquo;t be split up; all of the lots must be bought together. The cargo&rsquo;s total buy price equals 1d4 BP &times; the number of lots. For every 5 by which the result of your check exceeds the DC, you can increase or decrease the amount of cargo by 1 lot.<br /><br />The GM determines the type of cargo and might even tell you where you can sell it for a reasonable price. All of the cargo must be transported and sold together; you and your allies must load the cargo onto your starship yourselves. You might have to deliver some cargoes within a certain time frame. When you&rsquo;re told the type of cargo, its buy price, and (if applicable) its destination and its sell price, you can choose not to purchase that cargo. However, when you purchase the cargo, you decide what to do with it, though you might want to perform the find buyer downtime activity (see below) at another settlement to sell it.<br /><br />Special: If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shipping or Speculation?</h3>\n<p>When the PCs purchase cargo, they generally have to find a place to sell it themselves. After all, transport drivers who earn flat rates usually cover established shipping routes; as galactic traders, the PCs typically do more than that. However, at your discretion, the seller can give the PCs a tip as to where they might offload the cargo they just bought. This tactic can benefit players who&rsquo;ve just started interacting with this system or for groups who only want to dip their toes into the trading game. In such cases, the PCs don&rsquo;t need to use the find buyer downtime activity (see above), and they receive an amount of BP of your choosing per cargo lot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Destination</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that the cargo&rsquo;s seller gives the PCs an idea of where to sell those goods, you can choose that destination based on the needs of your campaign (especially if the players have expressed interest in going to a specific place). Alternatively, you can randomly determine the general destination by rolling a d10 on the table below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r D10]]</td>\n<td>DESTINATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}. If the PCs are already on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, reroll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2&ndash;4</td>\n<td>A different world in the same star system where the PCs bought the cargo.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5&ndash;7</td>\n<td>A world in Near Space.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8&ndash;10</td>\n<td>A world in the Vast.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Determine Complication</h2>\n<p>Once a PC finds the cargo, but before they commit to purchasing it, you should determine what makes this particular job unusual. You decide the complication, and the PCs decide how to deal with it&mdash;if they even become aware of the problem, that is!<br /><br />To randomly determine a complication, roll a d10 on the table below, keeping the result a secret. You can tweak the result as needed for your campaign; once you&rsquo;ve rolled the same result from the table a couple of times, consider throwing out that entry and substituting one of your own! If a complication requires a skill check, the DC for that check equals 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the party&rsquo;s APL. Usually, only one PC should attempt this check. An asterisk (*) marks a complication that the PCs can be made aware of before purchasing the cargo, and some complications modify the buy or sell price of the cargo.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r D10]]</td>\n<td>COMPLICATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Competition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Expiration Date*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Handling Problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>High Demand*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Imitation*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Regulated*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Stolen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Stowaway</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Strange Customs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Tough Sell</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Competition: Once the PCs have loaded their cargo and determined their destination, a rival crew contacts them and declares they&rsquo;re selling similar cargo at that location. Determine how long the rival crew takes to reach the destination (usually assuming average time in the Drift); if the PCs don&rsquo;t beat the rival crew to the destination, the sell price is reduced by 2 BP per lot.<br /><br />Expiration Date*: This cargo is perishable. If the PCs don&rsquo;t deliver it in 2d8 days, they can sell it for a maximum of 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Handling Problems: There&rsquo;s a potential accident while loading or unloading the cargo. Treat this complication as a trap with a CR equal to the party&rsquo;s APL. The exact nature of the trap and the skills necessary to disable it are up to you.<br /><br />High Demand*: This cargo is trending. The buy price is increased by 1 BP per lot, and the sell price is increased by 2 BP per lot.<br /><br />Imitation*: These goods are actually cheap knockoffs. A PC can detect this fact with a successful Perception check, reducing the buy and sell prices by 2 BP per lot. If the PCs want to try to sell the goods at the unreduced price, they must succeed at a Bluff check or else attract the attention of law enforcement.<br /><br />Regulated*: Exhaustive laws govern this cargo at the point of purchase. A PC must succeed at a Computers or Profession (merchant) check, or the crew members must spend 1 day navigating customs and filling out forms before they can load the cargo on their ship.<br /><br />Stolen: This cargo was stolen from another crew, and they&rsquo;re coming to get it back! This complication represents a hard encounter, but the PCs can pacify the NPCs by surrendering the cargo.<br /><br />Stowaway: An NPC with a CR equal to the party&rsquo;s APL hides among the cargo, revealing themself after takeoff. A PC who succeeds at a Perception check can detect the stowaway during the cargo-loading process.<br /><br />Strange Customs: The buyer comes from an unfamiliar culture or has unusual traditions. A PC must attempt a Culture check to maintain proper etiquette. If they succeed, the sell price increases by 1 BP per lot. If they fail, the sell price decreases by 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Tough Sell: The buyer tries to strong-arm the PCs, reducing the sell price by 2 BP per lot. A PC can negate this reduction with a successful Intimidate check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Transport</h2>\n<p>Next, the PCs must get the cargo onto their starship and transport it to a place where they can sell it. In general, the farther the PCs take the cargo, the more it&rsquo;s worth (see Table below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cargo Handling</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loading or unloading a single lot into a starship cargo hold takes 1 hour for one person using a cargo lifter (Core Rulebook 204) or similar equipment. Without such equipment, loading the same lot takes 8 hours of labor; multiple people can work together to reduce this time. For example, it takes 4 hours for two people without major equipment to load a single lot into a cargo hold. While the PCs can usually take their time, a complication might mean that every hour counts!<br /><br />The PCs must also unload the cargo once they reach the world where they want to sell it, but unloading generally occurs while at least one of the crew engages in the find buyer downtime activity (page 54).</p>\n<h2>Make the Sale</h2>\n<p>Once the PCs have reached the area where they want to try to sell their cargo, finding a buyer is a downtime activity detailed below. Certain complications might make this activity more difficult, but once a PC finds a buyer, you need to determine the sale price.</p>\n<h3>Cargo Sell Price</h3>\n<p>First, determine the base sell price of a cargo by rolling a d8; if you roll an 8, roll again once, and add the new result to 8. This result is modified by the distance traveled (as noted on the table below) and any complications, in that order; the total results in a sale price per lot (minimum 1 BP per lot). Finally, the results of the PCs&rsquo; find buyer downtime activity can also alter this price.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TRAVEL TIME</td>\n<td>DESTINATION</td>\n<td>BASE SELL PRICE MODIFIER</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 1d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>Another world in the system or @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}</td>\n<td>&ndash;2 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 2d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>One of the Pact Worlds other than @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} from outside the system</td>\n<td>&ndash;1 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 3d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>A Near Space world</td>\n<td>No change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 5d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>A Vast world</td>\n<td>+1 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Find Buyer</h3>\n<p>You look for someone interested in buying your cargo.<br /><br />Activity: You spend a day researching markets on the infosphere, checking with union or guild representatives, meeting with local contacts, and haggling. You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find a buyer in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your level).<br /><br />Results: On a success, you find someone willing to buy your cargo for the sell price (as determined by the GM). For every 5 by which your check exceeds the DC, increase the sell price of the cargo by 1 BP per lot. If you fail, you still find a buyer, but the sell price of the cargo is reduced by 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Special: If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Spending Build Points</h1>\n<p>The following section expands on the rules for spending Build Points and includes some obligatory expenditures (like upgrading the PCs&rsquo; starship so they can take on more lucrative jobs and bigger threats) as well as new options (like having a comfortable lifestyle or hiring employees). The PCs can hold onto as many unspent BP as they like.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expansion</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP to hire agents, professional representatives, and even full-time employees who work for them. They can also buy another starship and hire crew to haul cargo as part of their overall operations. When the PCs hire personnel to expand their business, you decide the NPCs&rsquo; stats (though usually, an NPC has a total skill bonus in a handful of skills equal to 4 + 1-1/2 &times; their CR). Though usually loyal to the PCs, these NPCs won&rsquo;t risk their lives. If treated poorly, they might leave the PCs&rsquo; service. An employee hired by the PCs agrees to a 1-year contract; at the end of that term, the PCs must hire them again, or the NPC leaves their service.<br /><br />Planetary Agent: A planetary agent costs BP equal to the agent&rsquo;s CR, which can be no higher than the party&rsquo;s APL; as the party&rsquo;s APL increases, the PCs can spend the difference to raise the agent&rsquo;s CR. The agent lives on one world or space station; while they may have many other clients, they work on the PCs&rsquo; behalf to perform the find cargo and find buyer downtime activities. The agent can also perform the gather information task of the Diplomacy skill. The agent won&rsquo;t leave the world on which they&rsquo;re stationed. The PCs must supply the agent with the credits or other requirements necessary for any task they ask the NPC to perform.<br /><br />System-Wide Representative: A system-wide representative operates similarly to a planetary agent, but the system-wide representative will travel to any world in a single star system (such as the Pact Worlds system). A system-wide representative costs BP equal to twice the representative&rsquo;s CR, which can be no higher than the party&rsquo;s APL.<br /><br />Starship: The PCs can use their BP to buy another starship. This starship can&rsquo;t be higher in tier than the party&rsquo;s APL &ndash; 2. The PCs must spend additional BP equal to 5 &times; the starship&rsquo;s tier to hire an NPC crew to run this starship; each crew member has a CR equal to the starship&rsquo;s tier, and they follow the PCs&rsquo; instructions when it comes to buying, transporting, and selling cargo as well as the starship&rsquo;s day-to-day operations. All the BP earned by this other ship goes to the party&rsquo;s pool of BP. The PCs are responsible for the costs and maintenance of any additional starships they own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\n<p>The PCs can insure their starship or cargo. Starship insurance policies cost a number of BP equal to a percentage of their starship&rsquo;s total BP value at time of purchase (see below). An insurance policy remains in effect for 1 year; after this time, the PCs must buy a new policy (at a higher price if their starship has increased in BP value). If the PCs&rsquo; starship is completely destroyed with a policy in effect, the PCs receive a percentage of the ship&rsquo;s BP value in payment. The rest of the Build Points the PCs spent on their starship are lost!<br /><br />Starship insurance policies are rated bronze, silver, and gold. A bronze insurance policy costs 5% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 50% of the total value. A silver insurance policy costs 10% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 75% of the total value. A gold insurance policy costs 15% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 100% of the total value.<br /><br />To insure cargo, the PCs can buy a policy for 10% of the cargo&rsquo;s buy price (minimum 1 BP). If the cargo is lost and not delivered, and the PCs can prove that they didn&rsquo;t steal or lose the cargo through negligence, they&rsquo;re repaid BP equal to the cargo&rsquo;s buy price.<br /><br />The PCs can have only one insurance policy per starship and per each cargo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP to live the good life. These lifestyles assume a group of 4 PCs; you can adjust the costs for larger and smaller groups as you see fit. Lifestyles don&rsquo;t impart any mechanical benefits to the characters.<br /><br />Comfortable: The party spends 1 BP to live comfortably for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in spacious lodgings decorated to their taste and have access to stylish personal transportation. They partake in high-quality food and drink whenever they wish, and they attire themselves in fashionable and flattering clothing.<br /><br />Luxurious: The party spends 5 BP to live in luxury for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in fabulous homes in an elite neighborhood; they have multiple forms of personal transportation, and unique fashions made for them by famous designers (equivalent to formal wear) fill their wardrobes. A large staff of professionals&mdash;housekeepers, gardeners, personal tailors and groomers, a chauffeur&mdash;see to everyday chores the PCs don&rsquo;t wish to concern themselves with (each professional is a professional freelancer with a skill bonus equal to the party&rsquo;s APL).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP on their starship if they have the time and facilities required make such upgrades (Starfinder Core Rulebook 305). Using this system, the total BP value of the PCs&rsquo; starship can be no more than 5% more than the value listed for its tier in Table 9-1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. For example: a group of 1st-level PCs have a tier 1 starship on which they have spent a total of 52 Build Points (saving the rest to purchase cargo). As they accumulate BP by selling cargo, they can spend, at most, 5 BP to upgrade their starship, raising its BP value to 57 (5% more than the 55 BP used to normally create a tier 1 starship). When their APL rises to 2, this group can upgrade their starship further but no higher than 78 BP (because a tier 2 starship is normally created with 75 BP). The PCs still can&rsquo;t spend more than 1,000 BP on their starship when their APL reaches 20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Downgrades</h2>\n<p>Due to bad luck or mishandling of cargo, the PCs might end up with no spare BP to keep the cycle of buying and selling going. In such cases, the PCs can sell parts of their starship to acquire BP. There&rsquo;s no added cost to downgrade; for instance, if the PCs want to pawn their vessel&rsquo;s coilgun, they receive the weapon&rsquo;s full BP cost of 6.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Running The System</h1>\n<p>In many ways, this subsystem helps generate short adventures for your cargo-hauling PCs since there&rsquo;s always a chance of something going a little wrong. At the very least, the system works hand-in-hand with a sandbox-style campaign, as the PCs travel from world to world looking to buy low and sell high!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Session Zero</h2>\n<p>Before beginning a game using the galactic trade subsystem, make sure your players are interested in engaging in the life of freelance merchants. While it might not seem as glamorous as delving into alien ruins or fighting back against an evil empire (though galactic traders can still undertake such adventures), this type of campaign has its appeal to certain players. Generally, merchant PCs aren&rsquo;t beholden to any one patron and can go where they please. However, if your group doesn&rsquo;t seem keen on the bookkeeping required, it might be better not to use this subsystem!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GMing Expectations</h2>\n<p>On average, the PCs will need to complete three to four cargo transport jobs to gain enough BP to upgrade their starship to the next tier. As the group advances in level, they might need to complete a few extra transport jobs per tier, depending on their market savvy and whether or not they&rsquo;ve switched to a larger frame that can hold more cargo.<br /><br />Of course, during this time, the PCs should earn XP in the usual ways (by overcoming skill-based challenges, defeating enemies, and earning story-based rewards) so that the group&rsquo;s APL keeps approximate pace with the amount of BP they can invest in their starship. At your discretion, you can reward the PCs with XP as if they had overcome an easy encounter (Starfinder Core Rulebook 390) upon selling their cargo; you should add this XP to any XP they earn from encounters that emerge from complications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Sources of Build Points</h2>\n<p>This subsystem assumes that the PCs earn their BP only from transporting and selling cargo. However, at your discretion, you can reward them with BP as treasure from particular encounters (such as a raid on a smuggling operation&rsquo;s warehouses) or as salvage from starship combat encounters (such as a fight against a rogue Corpse Fleet ship). In the former case, the PCs have to transport the BP to their ship much in the same way as loading cargo (count a cargo lot as 4 BP for these purposes), and in the latter case, the PCs can earn a number of BP depending on the enemy starship&rsquo;s size category (Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, etc.).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Free Traders</h1>\n<p>The free trader archetype is an excellent choice for a character in a campaign focused on galactic trade. The merchant savvy ability can be used with these rules as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A free trader can use market savvy to reroll the checks required for the find cargo and find buyer downtime activities.</li>\n<li>At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, a free trader can use market savvy to reroll skill checks during a complication.</li>\n<li>At 9th level, a free trader can transport an extra lot of cargo for every five cargo holds their starship has; at 14th level, this bonus increases to an extra lot of cargo for every two cargo holds their starship has.</li>\n<li>At 18th level, a free trader can spend Resolve Points to negotiate the best possible price, reducing the cargo&rsquo;s buy price by 1 BP per lot or raising the sell price of cargo by 1 BP per lot during the find cargo or find buyer downtime activities, respectively; the free trader must be the primary PC performing the activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"></span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

On some worlds, vast fungal growths tower into the sky, while on others metallic veins rise from the ground and connect in spidery canopies. Common rules sections to reference for forests are Catching on Fire (see @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.y2bNBKDGgf2EwmFP]{Heat Dangers} page 403), Falling Objects (see @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y]{Falling} page 401), Smoke Effects (see page 404), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.Y0iOmLxszsGz6Q6l]{Vision and Light} (see page 261).</p>\n<h3>Trees</h3>\n<p>Most forests are filled with trees, or something akin to trees, which provide partial cover to those standing in the same square as a tree. An average tree has an AC of 4, a hardness of 5, and 150 HP (see page 409 for rules on smashing an object). A successful DC 15 Athletics check is enough to climb most trees.</p>\n<h3>Undergrowth</h3>\n<p>Fungal blooms, vines, roots, and short bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. Undergrowth counts as difficult terrain (see page 257), provides concealment (20% miss chance), and increases the DCs of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren’t mutually exclusive; it’s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In A Forest</h3>\n<p>In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 3d6×10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8×10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6×10 feet.<br /><br />Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it’s usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill to hide. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.<br /><br />The background noise of a forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, usually increasing the DC of the check at the GM’s discretion.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"nwRAcqBuoleMkfZE","name":"Weapon Accessories","content":"<p><sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Source AR pg. 58</span></sub></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">The galaxy&rsquo;s weapons dealers offer a dizzying array of options, but sometimes the perfect weapon for a specialized job just isn&rsquo;t available as a base model. Luckily, weapon accessories can provide additional utility with just a little tinkering, which you can do yourself or pay a professional to handle. Weapon accessories modify existing weapons to provide certain benefits to the weapon&rsquo;s user. Experienced operators keep a variety of accessories on hand, swapping them out as needed. </span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Using Weapon Accessories</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Explanations of the statistics for weapon accessories are provided below, along with the rules for adding accessories to weapons. Specific accessories are sometimes exceptions to these rules. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Capacity And Usage</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Some accessories require power to function, similar to some technological items; see page 218 of the Core Rulebook for more information. These accessories are identified with capacity and usage entries in Table 1&ndash;11: Weapon Accessories. A weapon accessory&rsquo;s capacity is the highest-capacity battery that the accessory can use. Usage lists the rate at which charges are consumed when the accessory is used. Attached accessories (see Adding Accessories below) must use their own batteries, but an accessory integrated into a powered weapon can be configured to use either the weapon&rsquo;s battery or its own battery. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Type</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Some accessories can be added only to specific types or categories of weapons, as noted in the Weapon Type entry in Table 1&ndash;11: Weapon Accessories. For the most part, these correspond to the weapon types and categories described on pages 169&ndash;170 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Railed Weapons</strong>: Railed weapons are longarms, heavy weapons, and sniper weapons, all of which have rails along or near the weapon&rsquo;s barrel that allow you to easily add accessories to the weapon. A railed weapon has four rails to which accessories can be added: one on top, one on the bottom, and one on either side. Only one weapon accessory can be added to each rail. Some accessories must be attached to a specific rail, such as the top or bottom, as detailed in the accessory&rsquo;s description. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Adding Accessories</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Weapon accessories must normally be added to a weapon to function. Most accessories can be added either by being attached to a weapon or by being integrated into the weapon, though some accessories must be added in a certain way, as indicated in the accessory&rsquo;s description. In either case, add the bulk of the weapon accessory to the weapon&rsquo;s bulk to determine the final accessorized weapon&rsquo;s bulk. When adding multiple items of light bulk together, treat 2&ndash;10 light bulk items as 1 bulk when combined.<br /><br /><strong>Attachment</strong>: An attached weapon accessory is affixed to a weapon but is not really part of it. Anyone can attach or detach an accessory as a full action, and most weapons dealers will attach an accessory bought from them at no extra charge.<br /><br /><strong>Integration</strong>: An integrated weapon accessory is built into the weapon, becoming part of it. Integrated accessories are usually purchased already integrated into the weapon at the combined price of the weapon and the accessory. If the weapon and accessory are purchased separately, a weapons dealer can integrate the accessory into the weapon for a fee of 10% of the accessory&rsquo;s purchase price. You can integrate an accessory into a weapon (or remove an integrated accessory) if you have a number of ranks in Engineering (or both Engineering and Mysticism, for hybrid accessories) equal to the item level of the weapon or accessory, whichever is higher. It takes 1 hour to integrate an accessory or remove an integrated accessory from a weapon.</span></p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"o5FtLBDT0f0zig3C","name":"Sense Through","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Sense through is the special ability to perceive things beyond an obstacle or barrier that would otherwise block normal senses. It allows a creature to attempt Perception checks into areas that would otherwise lie beyond its senses. Sense through augments a creature’s precise or imprecise senses, rather than replacing them. For example, a creature cannot have a form of sense through based on vision unless it has standard vision. Sense through may be a supernatural power to sense things beyond normal perception or an extraordinary ability representing enhanced senses, and it can be granted by equipment (such as laser microphones and X-ray visors), natural abilities (such as some dragons’ ability to see through smoke), and other effects. Sense through operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with sense through typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision) allows a creature to see through obstacles that would normally block vision. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—for example, if a creature whose vision is augmented by sense through is blinded—the creature loses access to its sense through ability. The typical senses through which creatures with sense through can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, hearing, vibration, and vision.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with sense through (vision) is considered to have darkvision to a range of 60 feet unless stated otherwise. This enables the creature to perceive through materials such as armor, briefcases, and other concealing items, meaning the creature can use Perception to search more quickly and easily (searching up to a 20-foot-by-20-foot area in a single round), though such quick searches reveal only things accessible by that sense. If a secret door is concealed behind a material that blocks this ability (see below), a quick search using sense through (vision) would not reveal it.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some sense through abilities allow a creature to sense through only specific materials. Such materials are indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision [smoke only]) allows a creature to see through smoke as if it were not present, but all other obstacles to vision work normally. A sense through ability that works against only a specific material otherwise works like the sense it is associated with, including requiring Perception checks to notice things.</span></p>\n<h3>Blocking Sense Through</h3>\n<p> Some sense through abilities (generally those of a magical nature) cannot penetrate specific materials. This is indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, a lycanthrope with sense through (scent [blocked by silver]) can smell through walls—but not through even a thin layer of silver.</p>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, in addition to all other limitations, sense through is blocked by energy fields and sufficiently dense material. This includes all energy fields that impact the physical world (such as force fields that grant temporary Hit Points and force effects such as the wall of force spell). The density limitation generally causes these senses to be blocked by 10 feet of wood or plastic, 5 feet of stone, 1 foot of common metal, or 6 inches of lead or any starmetal (such as adamantine). Typical suits of armor and containers do not block such vision unless they specify otherwise.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Since the effects on each card can be deadly against player characters, we recommend using the first option.</p>\n<p>• Option 1: The GM draws a card only when a major villain, creature, or NPC scores a critical hit<br />• Option 2: Using this deck becomes an option that can be given to NPCs as a special ability, and the GM only draws cards for NPCs with that ability.<br />• Option 3: The GM draws a card when any creature or NPC scores a critical hit. </p>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL RULES </h3>\n<p>• A critical hit deals double damage to the target unless the entry says it deals normal damage or triple damage,<br />• Any effect listed as a Crit Effect is considered a critical hit effect. If your attack already has a critical hit effect, you may apply its normal critical hit effect or the card effect, but not both.<br />• If an effect is listed as a Bonus Effect, apply it in addition to the attack's other critical hit effects.<br />• Effects that scale by level use a weapon's item level, a spell's caster level, Or the character's level for supernatural effects as the critical hit effect's level.

{"_id":"p9aQ2VGOiE6f9mQT","name":"Invisible","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An invisible creature is visually undetectable. A creature using only an imprecise sense, or whose only precise sense is vision, can’t observe an invisible creature, so the invisible creature is unseen by such a would-be observer. Creatures with blindsight can perceive invisible creatures normally, since blindsight is a precise sense that does not rely on vision, and thus can observe invisible creatures. See Senses on page 260 and Dealing with Unseen Creatures on page 261 for more information.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Invisible creatures remain invisible even in unusual environments, such as underwater, and when subject to effects such as fog or smoke. They are not magically silenced. They can still be heard, smelled, and felt as normal, even if other creatures can’t see them. Invisible creatures leave tracks and can be tracked normally. A character looking for an invisible creature might find his quarry if the invisible creature drops an item, speaks, smells strongly, leaves an obvious trail, or performs some action that makes itself known. Finding an invisible creature in this way requires a Perception check as normal. If successful, and assuming your only precise sense is vision, you become aware of the invisible creature’s presence, but you don’t know its exact location. If you’re looking for an invisible creature, the GM might rule that you have a bonus or penalty to your Perception checks based on the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items it picks up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus creating the effect of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the creature carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Invisibility does not thwart divination spells or effects. Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks (see the <em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em>). If you are or become invisible while grappled, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to escape being grappled, but you gain no other benefit against the grappler. </span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how much damage is resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage is from a mundane or magical source. If an attack deals both kinetic damage and energy damage (such as dealing 3d6 bludgeoning and 1d6 fire damage), energy resistance applies to the energy damage but doesn’t reduce the kinetic damage.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If energy resistance completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an operative’s debilitating trick or poison delivered via an injury. Energy resistance does not negate ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels dealt along with an energy attack, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have energy resistance against the same energy type from more than one source, the two forms of energy resistance do not stack unless the sources of the energy resistance specifically note otherwise.

{"_id":"tc2udi7kiGimJ1jA","name":"Standard Actions","content":"<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL]{Actions in Combat}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 244</p>\n<p>A standard action is usually the main action you take each round, other than movement. Below are examples of standard actions.</p>\n<h2>Activate an Item</h2>\n<p>Many technological and magic items, such as a cybernetic arm, don’t need to be activated. Certain items, however, do need to be activated to have an effect. Unless otherwise noted, activating such an item is a standard action.</p>\n<h2>Attack</h2>\n<p>Making a single attack is a standard action.</p>\n<h3>Melee Attacks</h3>\n<p>With a melee weapon, you can strike any opponent in a square adjacent to your space. You add your Strength modifier to your melee attack rolls and to your melee damage rolls.</p>\n<p>Some melee weapons in Chapter 7 have the reach special property, as indicated in their descriptions, and some monsters have natural reach. Typically, a character or monster with reach can attack any foe within their reach (see Reach and Threatened Squares on page 255 for more details).</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or otherwise attack a target that is within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect (see page 271). You add your Dexterity modifier to your ranged attack rolls, but not to your ranged damage rolls.</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks with a Thrown Weapon</h3>\n<p>With a thrown weapon or a grenade, you can make a ranged attack at a target that is within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect (see page 271). You add your Strength modifier to your ranged attack rolls with a thrown weapon, and to your damage rolls with weapons with the thrown special property. Do not add your Strength modifier to damage rolls with grenades.</p>\n<h3>Targeting a Grid Intersection</h3>\n<p>When using a weapon with the explode special property or a thrown weapon that has an area effect, such as a grenade, you target a specific grid intersection on a tactical battle map, rather than a specific creature. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5.</p>\n<h3>Missing with a Thrown Weapon</h3>\n<p>If you miss on a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, the weapon lands in a random square or grid intersection as appropriate near your target. To determine where it lands, roll 1d8. This determines the initial misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction, as illustrated in the diagram above. After you’ve determined the misdirection of the throw, roll 1d4. The result is how many squares away in that direction the weapon lands.</p>\n<p>For example, after a missed ranged attack with a grenade, a player rolls 1d8 with a result of 1. This indicates that the grenade’s initial misdirection falls short of the target intersection. Then, the player rolls 1d4 with a result of 2. This determines that the grenade actually lands at an intersection 2 squares in front of the target intersection.</p>\n<h3>Range and Penalties</h3>\n<p>A ranged weapon’s range increment is listed along with its other statistics (see Chapter 7). If you make an attack with a ranged weapon from a distance greater than its listed range, you take a cumulative –2 penalty to the attack roll for each full range increment of distance between you and the target beyond the first (or fraction thereof).</p>\n<p>For most ranged weapons, the maximum range is 10 range increments, or 10× the number listed as the weapon’s range. For thrown weapons, the maximum range is 5 range increments. Some ranged weapons have different maximum ranges, but if so, their descriptions specify their maximum ranges.</p>\n<h3>Critical Hits</h3>\n<p>When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20), you hit regardless of your target’s AC. If the total result of your attack roll meets or exceeds the target’s EAC or KAC (as appropriate for your attack), you’ve also scored a critical hit. You roll your damage twice, each time with all your usual bonuses and including any additional damage from special abilities, and then add the rolls together. Some weapons inflict a special effect on a target of a critical hit, in addition to dealing double damage (see page 182).</p>\n<p>If the total result of your attack is less than your target’s relevant AC, your attack still hits on a natural 20, but it deals damage normally.</p>\n<h2>Cast a Spell</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of spells require at least a standard action to cast, and sometimes more. Spells that take more than a round to cast require a full action each round until they are complete. For more information about how spells and magic work, see Chapter 10.</p>\n<h3>Casting While Threatened</h3>\n<p>Casting a spell takes a significant amount of concentration, forcing you to lower your defenses briefly. When you cast a spell, it gives targets threatening you in melee a chance to make an attack of opportunity against you (see Attack of Opportunity on page 248), unless the spell specifies otherwise—normally only the case for a few spells with a range of touch. If this attack of opportunity hits and damages you, you fail to cast the spell and lose the spell slot. For more information about threatened squares, see page 255.</p>\n<h2>Combat Maneuver</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can attempt one of the following combat maneuvers. For each maneuver, choose an opponent within your reach (including your weapon’s reach, if applicable) and then make a melee attack roll against the opponent’s KAC + 8. The effects of success vary depending on the maneuver, as described below.</p>\n<h3>Bull Rush</h3>\n<p>You knock the target back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8. If an obstacle is in the way, the target stops at the obstacle instead.</p>\n<h3>Dirty Trick</h3>\n<p>You make an unorthodox attack to briefly hinder the target. A dirty trick could be throwing sand in the target’s eyes, jamming a rock into his actuators, or any other improvised action designed to put your opponent at a disadvantage. Your target is blinded, deafened, entangled, off-target, shaken, or sickened (your choice) for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8 (see Conditions beginning on page 273 for information on these conditions). The target can remove the condition as a move action. A dirty trick is normally a melee attack, but a GM can allow certain actions to count as dirty tricks at range, in which case you take a –2 penalty to your attack roll for every 5 feet between you and the target.</p>\n<h3>Disarm</h3>\n<p>You knock an item the target is holding out of the target’s hands and onto the ground. If you have a hand free, you can automatically grab the item with your hand before it falls.</p>\n<h3>Grapple</h3>\n<p>You hold the target in place. You must have at least one hand free to perform a grapple combat maneuver. Your target has the grappled condition, meaning she can’t move from her current space and takes further penalties until she either uses a standard action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver to grapple you (giving you the grappled condition) or uses the escape task of the Acrobatics skill to break free. If the result of your attack roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 13, the target is instead pinned for the same duration, and she can’t take any actions that involve moving her limbs other than to attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>The grappled or pinned condition lasts until the end of your next turn, unless you renew it on your next turn with another grapple combat maneuver. The condition ends immediately if you move away. As long as you have one target grappled or pinned, you cannot attempt to grapple another. The grappled and pinned conditions are further detailed in Conditions on pages 276–277.</p>\n<p>When you renew a grapple, you can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed, including most weapons and equipment (but not worn armor). Doing so immediately ends the grapple.</p>\n<h3>Reposition</h3>\n<p>You change the target’s position to a different location still within your reach and within 5 feet of its original placement. You can move the target 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8, but all movement must remain within your reach. You cannot move the target past an obstacle.<br /><br />If you reposition a creature as a full action, you can move a distance equal to the distance you repositioned your target (up to your move speed), dragging the target along with you.</p>\n<h3>Sunder</h3>\n<p>You deal damage to one object held in the target’s hand or accessible on its body. The object must be something that could be drawn easily by the target as a move action (see Draw or Sheathe a Weapon on page 247). The damage is reduced by an amount equal to the object’s hardness (see Smashing an Object page 409).</p>\n<h3>Trip</h3>\n<p>You knock the target prone if it is on the ground. A target in the air instead descends 10 feet, falling prone if this causes it to fall to the ground. A target in zero gravity is instead knocked offkilter. The prone and off-kilter conditions are further detailed on pages 276–277.</p>\n<h2>Concentrate to Maintain a Spell</h2>\n<p>Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action (see Duration on page 270 for more information about concentration).</p>\n<h2>Covering Fire</h2>\n<p>You can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that provides covering fire for an ally. Make a ranged attack roll against AC 15. If you hit, you deal no damage but the selected ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the next attack from a creature in your line of effect (see page 271), so long as that attack occurs before your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Dismiss a Spell</h2>\n<p>Dismissing an active spell is a standard action (see Duration on page 270 for more information about dismissible spells).</p>\n<h2>Feint</h2>\n<p>You can use your standard action to feint by attempting a Bluff check. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s Sense Motive total skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. You can’t feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score, and you cannot take 10 or take 20 (see page 133 in Chapter 5) on a Bluff check to feint. When you successfully feint, you treat your opponent as flat-footed for your next attack against him before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Fight Defensively</h2>\n<p>You can fight defensively when attacking as part of a standard action. If you do, you take a –4 penalty to attacks and gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Harrying Fire</h2>\n<p>You can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that distracts a foe in your line of effect. Make an attack roll against AC 15. If you hit, you deal no damage, but the next ally to attack that foe gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her next attack roll, as long as that attack occurs before your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Total Defense</h2>\n<p>You can defend yourself as a standard action. Starting at the beginning of this action, you get a +4 bonus to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn. You can’t combine total defense with other actions that increase your AC, nor can you make attacks of opportunity while benefiting from total defense.</p>\n<h2>Use a Special Ability</h2>\n<p>There are three types of special abilities: extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural. Special abilities often carry the parenthetical abbreviations (Ex), (Sp), or (Su) to indicate whether they are extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural abilities. Some are ongoing, while others are use-activated. For more details, including descriptions of specific special abilities, see page 262.</p>\n<p>Using a special ability is usually a standard action, unless it is an ongoing ability or the ability says otherwise. In rare cases, an ability might take a full action or a move action to activate. In most cases, a use-activated special ability cannot be activated as a swift action. Using a spell-like ability typically provokes attacks of opportunity (see page 248) unless stated otherwise.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

For instance, opening a door normally doesn’t require a check, but it does if the door is locked. The following actions are move actions.</p>\n<h2>Crawl</h2>\n<p>You can crawl 5 feet as a move action. A crawling character is considered prone.</p>\n<h2>Direct or Redirect an Effect</h2>\n<p>Some technology and spells allow you to redirect an effect to new targets or areas. Redirecting requires a move action unless the technology or spell states otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Draw or Sheathe a Weapon</h2>\n<p>Drawing a weapon so that you can use it in combat or putting it away so that you have a free hand requires a move action. This action includes activating or deactivating the weapon. This also applies to weapon-like objects that are easily accessible, such as remote controls and most tools or sensors you can carry and use with one hand. If your weapon or weapon-like object is stored in a pack or otherwise out of easy reach, you must instead retrieve it as a stored item before you can use it (see Manipulate an Item below).</p>\n<p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can combine drawing or sheathing a weapon or weapon-like object with moving up to your speed as a single move action.</p>\n<h2>Guarded Step</h2>\n<p>You can carefully step 5 feet as a move action. This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity (see page 248), even if you’re in a threatened square (see page 255).</p>\n<h2>Manipulate an Item</h2>\n<p>Moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action. This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a door.</p>\n<h2>Move Your Speed</h2>\n<p>The simplest move action is moving up to your speed (see Speed on page 255 for more information). Many nonstandard modes of movement are also covered under this action, including burrowing (using your natural burrow speed, if you have one), climbing and swimming (using either the Athletics skill or your natural climb or swim speed, if you have one), or flying (using the Acrobatics skill if you have either access to flight or a natural fly speed). See Additional Movement Types on page 258 for more details. Some full actions (such as the operative’s trick attack) allow you to move as well, which act as moving up to your speed.</p>\n<h2>Reload</h2>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, reloading is a move action that includes grabbing ammunition you have readily available. Some weapons require different actions to reload; see the weapon’s description.</p>\n<h2>Stand Up</h2>\n<p>This special form of move action allows you to stand up from a prone position.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63","name":"Weather","content":"<p>CRB pg. 398</p>\n<p>Weather can play an important role in an adventure. The following section describes weather common on most habitable worlds. Additional rules for cold and heat dangers can be found in Environmental Rules starting on page 400.</p>\n<h3>Rain And Snow</h3>\n<p>Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another. Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure vision as effectively as dense fog. Most precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. If the temperature drops from above freezing to 32° F or below, it might produce ice.</p>\n<h3>Rain</h3>\n<p>Rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a –4 penalty to Perception checks. It has the same effect on flames and Perception checks as severe wind (see below).</p>\n<h3>Snow</h3>\n<p>Falling snow has the same effects on visibility and skill checks as rain. Snow-covered squares count as difficult terrain. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground.</p>\n<h3>Heavy Snow</h3>\n<p>Heavy snow has the same effects as normal snowfall but also restricts visibility as fog does (see Fog on page 399). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4 feet of snow on the ground. Snow at this depth counts as difficult terrain, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds might result in snowdrifts 1d4×5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind—a reinforced wall or a large force field, for instance. There’s a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompanied by lightning (see Thunderstorm on page 399).</p>\n<h3>Other Precipitation</h3>\n<p>There are other forms of precipitation, such as freezing rain, hail, and sleet. These generally function as rain when falling, but at the GM’s discretion, they may also have effects on movement similar to snow once they accumulate on the ground.</p>\n<h3>Storms</h3>\n<p>The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that accompany storms reduce visibility ranges by three-quarters, imposing a –8 penalty to Perception checks. Storms make aiming with ranged weapons difficult, imposing a –2 penalty to attack rolls, and archaic ranged weapons can’t be fired at all. Storms automatically extinguish unprotected flames. Storms commonly appear in three types: dust, snow, or thunder.</p>\n<h3>Dust Storm</h3>\n<p>These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a dust storm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most dust storms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. There is a 10% chance for a dust storm to be accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table 11–6: Wind Effects on page 400); this greater dust storm deals 1d3 nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also poses a choking hazard (see Suffocation and Drowning on page 404). A greater dust storm leaves 2d3–1 feet of fine sand in its wake.</p>\n<h3>Snowstorm</h3>\n<p>In addition to the wind and precipitation common to other types of storms, a snowstorm leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.</p>\n<h3>Thunderstorm</h3>\n<p>In addition to wind and precipitation, a thunderstorm is accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters who don’t have proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm (GM rolls to hit). Each bolt deals between 4d8 and 10d8 electricity damage. One in 10 thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado.</p>\n<h3>Powerful Storms</h3>\n<p>Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero and can make Perception checks and ranged weapon attacks difficult. Powerful storms are divided into the following types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blizzard: The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d4 feet), and extreme cold make blizzards deadly for those unprepared for them.</li>\n<li>Hurricane: In addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity is extremely difficult under such conditions.</li>\n<li>Tornado: With incredibly high winds, tornadoes can severely injure and kill creatures pulled into their funnels.</li>\n<li>Windstorm: While accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through the force of their winds (see Winds below).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fog</h3>\n<p>Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance).</p>\n<h3>Winds</h3>\n<p>Wind can create a stinging spray of dust, sand, or water, fan a large fire, rock an atmospheric transport midflight, and blow gases or vapors away. If powerful enough, it can even interfere with some ranged attacks and knock characters down. Below are the most common wind forces seen on habitable worlds.</p>\n<h3>Light Wind</h3>\n<p>A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.</p>\n<h3>Moderate Wind</h3>\n<p>A steady wind often extinguishing small, unprotected flames.</p>\n<h3>Strong Wind</h3>\n<p>Gusts that automatically put out any unprotected flames. Such gusts impose a –2 penalty to nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls.</p>\n<h3>Severe Wind</h3>\n<p>Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –4 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Windstorm</h3>\n<p>Powerful enough to bring down branches, if not whole trees. Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –4 penalty, while attacks with archaic ranged weapons are impossible. Perception checks that rely on sound take a –8 penalty due to the howling of the wind. Small characters might be knocked down.</p>\n<h3>Hurricane-Force Wind</h3>\n<p>Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –8 penalty, and archaic ranged weapon attacks are impossible. Perception checks based on sound are impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees. Most characters are knocked down due to the force of these winds.</p>\n<h3>Tornado</h3>\n<p>All flames are extinguished. All nonenergy ranged weapon attacks are impossible, as are sound-based Perception checks. A creature in close proximity to a tornado that fails a DC 15 Strength check is sucked toward the tornado. All creatures that come into contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage per round, before being violently expelled in a random direction (falling damage, described below, might apply). While a tornado’s rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Table 11-6: Wind Effects</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind Force</td>\n<td>Wind Speed</td>\n<td>Ranged Attack Penalty*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>0–10 mph</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>11–20 mph</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>21–30 mph</td>\n<td>–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>31–50 mph</td>\n<td>–4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windstorm</td>\n<td>51–74 mph</td>\n<td>–4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hurricane</td>\n<td>75–174 mph</td>\n<td>–8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tornado</td>\n<td>175–300 mph</td>\n<td>Impossible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* This applies only to nonenergy ranged weapons.

A character can’t recover from the damage dealt by a hot environment until she gets out of the heat and cools off.<br /><br />A character in very hot conditions (above 90° F) must attempt a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty to their saving throws. A character can attempt a Survival check to receive a bonus to this saving throw, and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see page 148).<br /><br />In severe heat (above 110° F), a character must attempt a Fortitude saving throw once every 10 minutes (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty to their saves. A character can attempt a Survival check to receive a bonus to this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see page 148).<br /><br />Extreme heat (air temperature over 140° F, boiling water, fire, and lava) deals lethal fire damage. Breathing air in extreme heat deals 1d6 fire damage per minute (no saving throw). In addition, a character must attempt a Fortitude saving throw every 5 minutes (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Hotter environments can deal more damage at the GM’s discretion.<br /><br />A character who takes any damage from heat exposure suffers from heatstroke (same as the fatigued condition; see page 276). These penalties end when the character recovers from the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.<br /><br />Boiling water deals anywhere from 1d6 to 10d6 fire damage per round of exposure, depending on water temperature and level of immersion.</p>\n<h3>Catching On Fire</h3>\n<p>Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and noninstantaneous magical fires might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Spells or technological items with an instantaneous effect don’t normally set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and go in a flash.<br /><br />A character at risk of catching fire must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (usually DC 15) or gain the burning condition (see page 273). Those whose clothes or equipment catch fire must attempt a separate Reflex saving throw (at the same DC) for each item. On a failed saving throw, flammable items take the same amount of damage as the character.</p>\n<h3>Lava Effects</h3>\n<p>Lava or magma deals a minimum of 2d6 fire damage per round of exposure, while cases of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano) deal upward of 20d6 fire damage per round. The exact damage is left to the GM’s discretion, based on situational terrain elements.<br /><br />Damage from lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 per round). Immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity or resistance to lava or magma.

In addition to hospitable atmospheres, there are various other types of atmosphere that serve as hazards to most life.</p>\n<h3>Corrosive</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a corrosive atmosphere eats away at matter. The type and speed of the erosion varies, but the most common use of this term describes atmospheres capable of dissolving most matter. A typical corrosive atmosphere deals anywhere from 1 acid damage per minute up to 10d6 acid damage per round to creatures and objects within. Certain metals and treated materials may be immune to the specific atmosphere of a planet, and often the corrosion can be mitigated with dutiful preparation.</p>\n<h3>No Atmosphere</h3>\n<p>A creature on a planet without an atmosphere (or with an atmosphere so thin that it is effectively airless) is exposed to a vacuum (see page 394).</p>\n<h3>Normal</h3>\n<p>A normal atmosphere is one that can support the majority of breathing life-forms. Most such atmospheres are composed of some combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and other nontoxic gases.</p>\n<h3>Thick</h3>\n<p>A nonacclimated creature operating in a thick atmosphere treats it as somewhat harmful, due to the extra chemical compounds in the air and the increased atmospheric pressure. Every hour, such a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or become sickened. This condition ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere. Conversely, the increased weight of the air grants a +4 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly or Piloting checks to keep an aircraft in flight.</p>\n<p>Severely thick atmospheres are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature in such an atmosphere must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate (see Suffocation and Drowning on page 404) as its lungs cease coping with the density of the oxygen inhaled and lose the strength to keep pumping air into its bloodstream.</p>\n<h3>Thin</h3>\n<p>Thinner atmospheres tend to cause a nonacclimated creature to have difficulty breathing and become extremely tired. A typical thin atmosphere requires such a creature to succeed at a Fortitude save each hour (DC = 15 +1 per previous check) or become fatigued. The fatigue ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Severely thin atmospheres can cause long-term oxygen deprivation to those affected in addition to the effects of a standard thin atmosphere. The first time a creature in a severely thin atmosphere fails its Fortitude save, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 damage to all ability scores. A creature acclimated to high altitude (see Hill and Mountain Terrain on page 397) gains a +4 insight bonus to its saving throw to resist this effect.</p>\n<h3>Toxic</h3>\n<p>Toxic atmospheres are composed of poisonous compounds and vary radically in their consistencies. Some toxic atmospheres are capable of sustaining oxygen-breathing life-forms, while others immediately suffocate those within them. Regardless of whether or not they allow creatures to breathe, toxic atmospheres are threats to most living creatures, as they act as an inhaled poison (see page 417). Though the specific type of poison varies, many toxic atmospheres act as existing poisons but with radically different onset times and save DCs. Low-level toxic atmospheres can have onset times measured in hours or days, while heavily toxic atmospheres have onset times measured in rounds.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"zDW0cDPQL55G7ose","name":"Breaking Objects","content":"<p>CRB pg. 409</p>\n<p>When attempting to break an object, you have two choices: smashing it with a weapon or destroying it with sheer strength.</p>\n<h3>Smashing An Object</h3>\n<p>Using a weapon to smash a foe’s weapon or an object accessible on the foe’s body is accomplished with the sunder combat maneuver (see page 246). Smashing an unattended object is similar, except this attack roll is opposed by the object’s Armor Class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Unattended objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don’t usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object’s Armor Class is equal to 10 + a modifier due to its size (see Table 11–12: Size and Armor Class of Objects) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (–5 modifier) but also an additional –2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if a creature takes a full action to line up a shot, it automatically hits with a melee weapon and gains a +5 bonus to an attack roll with a ranged weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Each object has hardness—a number that represents how well it resists damage. Each time an object is damaged, its hardness is subtracted from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object’s Hit Points. On average, a sturdy piece of equipment (such as a weapon or a suit of armor) has a hardness equal to 5 + 2 × its item level. Any other piece of equipment has a hardness equal to 5 + its item level.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> An object’s Hit Point total depends on its item level and is modified by additional criteria. On average, a sturdy piece of equipment (such as a weapon or a suit of armor) has a number of Hit Points equal to 15 + 3 × its item level. Any other piece of equipment has a number of Hit Points equal to 5 + its item level. Any item of level 15th or higher receives an extra 30 Hit Points. Very large objects may have separate Hit Point totals for different sections. Objects do not have Stamina Points.<br /><br /><em>Damaged Objects:</em> A damaged object remains functional (though it has the broken condition; see page 273) until the item’s Hit Points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed. Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Engineering skill or a number of spells.<br /><br /><em>Ineffective Weapons:</em> Certain weapons can’t effectively deal damage to certain objects. Most low-level melee weapons have little effect on metal walls and doors. Certain pieces of equipment are designed to cut through metal, however.<br /><br /><em>Immunities:</em> Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.<br /><br /><em>Vulnerability</em> to Certain Attacks: Certain attacks are especially strong against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and might ignore the object’s hardness.</li>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Effects that deal damage generally damage unattended objects normally but don’t damage held or attended objects unless the effect specifically says otherwise. Effects that do something other than deal damage affect only objects if their descriptions specifically say so (only common with spells) or note “(object)” in the description of the effect’s saving throw. An object’s total saving throw bonus for Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves is equal to the object’s caster level or item level. An object that is held or worn uses the saving throw bonus of the creature carrying it if that bonus is better than its own saving throw bonus. Items with a caster level or item level of 0 don’t receive saving throws when unattended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Destroying Objects Using Strength</h3>\n<p>When a character tries to destroy a certain object by using sudden force rather than by dealing damage, he attempts a Strength check (rather than making attack and damage rolls, as with the sunder combat maneuver) to determine whether he succeeds. Since hardness does not affect an object’s break DC, this value depends more on the construction of the item in question than on the material the object is made of. Consult Table 11–13: DCs to Break Objects for a list of common break DCs.</p>\n<p>If an object has lost half or more of its Hit Points, the object gains the broken condition (see page 273) and the DC to break it is reduced by 2.</p>\n<p>Larger and smaller creatures get bonuses and penalties to Strength checks to break objects as follows: Fine –16, Diminutive –12, Tiny –8, Small –4, Large +4, Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Table 11-12: Size and Armor Class of Objects</h3>\n<table style=\"height:170px;width:30%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<th style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Size</th>\n<th style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">AC Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Colossal</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">–8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">–4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">–1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Diminutive</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:50.0203%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Fine</td>\n<td style=\"width:49.2614%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Table 11-13: DCs to Break Objects</h3>\n<table style=\"height:102px;width:40%\" border=\"1px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<th style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Task</th>\n<th style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Strength DC</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Break down wooden door</td>\n<td style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Burst rope bonds</td>\n<td style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Burst steel restraints</td>\n<td style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Break down steel door</td>\n<td style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:66.8866%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">Bend nanocarbon bars</td>\n<td style=\"width:32.395%;height:17px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;text-align:center\">35</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
