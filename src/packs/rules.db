Almost anything can be found hiding inside their mainframes, from the plans for wondrous new technological marvels to some of the darkest corporate secrets imaginable. That said, most computers consist of simple information and control systems. Gaining access to computers in order to reach their files and control modules is a common occurrence in the game—and even sometimes required. The following rules are designed to give GMs the tools necessary to design computer systems that are both interesting and challenging.</p><h1>Basics</h1><p>Each computer system is made up of various simple statistics that tell the GM how the computer functions, what it knows, what it controls, and what it can do to defend itself. This information is presented in the following terms.</p><h2>Tier</h2><p>The computer’s tier indicates its overall technological sophistication, from 1 to 10. A tier-1 computer might be something as simple as a common datapad, a door lock, or a lighting controller, whereas a tier-10 computer represents the systems managing the engine core of a space station or the mainframe of an Aspis Consortium intersystem office. Note that the workstation of a tier-10 computer mainframe might itself be only a tier-3 computer, but it cannot in any way access or control the full mainframe, even if hacked; it can interface with only the components to which it has been granted access. Thus, access to the mainframe itself and features it controls requires hacking its tier-10 defenses.</p><p>The tier of a computer determines its base price and the base DC to hack into its system using a Computers check. Both of these are modified by the modules and countermeasures installed on a system (see Modules and Countermeasures below). The base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier.</p><h2>User Interface</h2><p>A computer’s control module is the input device and display designed to allow you to enter commands into and receive data from the computer. In the Pact Worlds, most user interfaces include a keyboard, view screen, microphone, and speakers, to allow typed, spoken, or gesture-based commands to be given to the computer and to deliver graphic or audio data from the computer. These kinds of user interfaces come free with any system, and a computer can have as many as ten user interfaces per point of bulk the computer has (though normally only public systems or computers used by large companies do this).</p><p>It is also possible for a user interface to exist only as a broadcast device (such as a comm unit), or even to have another smaller computer act as a user interface (using a control module). You can set a computer to use this kind of user interface for free when you buy it, though you must pay for the additional device separately, or you can install (or remove) user interfaces using the disable or manipulate module task of the Computers skill to alter a user interface. Such additional user interfaces do not count against the total modules a computer can have.</p><p>You can use a hacking kit to access a computer without using a user interface, but this requires you to have physical contact with the computer or to make contact through an infosphere or similar network that is linked to the computers.</p><h2>Size</h2><p>Computers can be extremely small, but miniaturizing such units without sacrificing computational power or durability increases a computer’s price. At base, a computer has a bulk equal to its tier squared. Computers with light bulk or negligible bulk can be worn easily on the wrist or clipped to communications devices and used without having to hold them in a hand. Any computer with a bulk of 1 or more must be held or set on a sturdy surface to be used. Computers with a bulk of 25 or more are not designed for portability, and normally they are permanently mounted to furniture or a vehicle or starship. You can reduce the size of a computer with the miniaturization upgrade (see page 216).</p><h2>Access and Authorization</h2><p>Computers are designed for users to quickly and easily gain access to their files and functions. A computer may have unsecured access, which allows anyone able to interact with its user interface to perform basic functions. In such cases it usually has secured root access, so more crucial features remain available to only a select few. A computer can have unsecured root access, but this is normally only the case for a newly-purchased computer, and the first owner is expected to establish secure root access as soon as possible.</p><h3>Access</h3><p>Access means you are able to use all the basic functions of the computer, which generally includes retrieval of any information not stored in a secure data module (see page 215), the ability to send and receive messages from other devices or systems connected to the computer (which may include access to a planetary infosphere), and control of any minor functions (such as door controls, entertainment systems, light switches, and other common household devices) controlled by the computer.</p><p>In most cases, it is obvious at a glance whether a computer’s user interface has unsecured access or whether it is necessary to attempt a Computers check to hack the system.</p><h3>Root Access</h3><p>Root access is a more advanced form of access that allows you to use all of a computer’s functions and modules, bypass or set conditions for its countermeasures, and look at, copy, add to, and delete any of its secured data. With root access, you can also grant a specific individual with access the ability to use a specific module or countermeasure you control that would not normally be available to the base access level.</p><p>You can gain root access only when a computer is first purchased, when it is granted by another creature that already has root access, or when you make a successful Computers check to hack the system and beat the computer’s normal DC by 20 or more. Normally, root access applies to a computer as a whole, but modules behind a firewall can have their own separate root access permissions.</p><h3>Secured Computers</h3><p>Most systems attempt to balance access and security with a two-step verification process to confirm authorized access, entailing both a physical security key (which might be nearly any tangible object, such as a keycard, palm print, or even another computer) and a password (often a fairly long string of characters entered through a keyboard, but also potentially a voiceprint or song, a telepathic command, or a riddle easily understood if you know the context).</p><p>Characters who are authorized, have the security object, and know the password can access a computer and use it for its intended purpose without needing to hack into it. Both a security key and a password can limit a character’s access to only some modules or tiers of a computer and don’t allow the user to access other functions. If you attempt to hack a computer, you gain a significant advantage if you acquire its security key or password, each giving you a +5 bonus to Computers checks to hack. However, the access granted by such security measures can easily be revoked by someone who already has access to the computer if that individual knows you have somehow obtained a security key or learned a password. Similarly, if you use either a security key or password to gain a bonus to a Computers check and then fail that check by 5 or more, the system automatically locks access against further attempts from the specific security credential used, which no longer grants its bonus to future checks.</p><h2>Basic Functions</h2><p>Computers are good at storing data, making calculations, manipulating and sorting information, performing rote tasks, and combining these tasks (often in the form of apps or programs). A computer may be set up to perform any of these functions in a general way, and it’s impossible to define everything a computer can possibly do. In general, computers can be treated as tools that streamline tasks that would otherwise demand significant bookkeeping, computation, sorting, tracking, or viewing, as long as the needed data can be input. Such tasks are normally part of a computer’s basic functions (though the data they need might well be kept behind a firewall, in a secure data module, or both), and ultimately it is up to a GM to determine a computer’s total capacity for performing such basic functions.</p><p>A basic function can also control a simple device such as a fire-suppression system, remote door, or a video camera— anything with simple on and off functions. New basic functions of this type can be added with a successful DC 10 Computers check, though the GM has final say on what an appropriate basic function is for a computer. Anything more complex that would normally require a creature to operate must be controlled through a control module (see page 215).</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>Modules define what a computer is capable of doing beyond its basic functions. Computers can have any number of modules. These typically fall into one of four categories: control, secure data, spell chips, and upgrades. Control modules can operate a device or object that is in some way linked to the computer, such as a video camera or even a connected robot. A secure data module contains a vast amount of information, from technical blueprints to financial ledgers or perhaps personal correspondence. Spell chips are special magic items that allow a computer to generate spell effects. Finally, upgrades are simply improvements to the computer system that increase the difficulty of hacking the computer, expand its reach, or make it faster and easier to use. For more information about common computer modules, see Modules on page 215.</p><h2>Countermeasures</h2><p>  Countermeasures are specific actions that occur if someone tries to hack into a computer system. Some spring into action only if someone attempts and fails a Computers check to hack the system, while others activate whenever anyone tries to access the machine in any way. The most basic countermeasures simply remove access from a user or specific user interface, whereas more advanced countermeasures might alert robot sentries or even emit a lethal shock. A computer can have a maximum number of countermeasures equal to its tier. For more details about common computer countermeasures, see Countermeasures beginning on page 216.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier</td><td>Price</td><td>DC to Hack</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>50</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>250</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1,250</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5,000</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10,000</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>20,000</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>40,000</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>80,000</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>160,000</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>320,000</td><td>53</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

However, other forms of interstellar travel existed prior to the Drift. Many of these are still in use today, alongside other recent innovations in stellar drives. While some of these remain in the experimental stage, they provide intriguing alternatives to Drift travel.</p></blockquote><p>Drift engines enable starships to overcome the limitations of traveling faster than light by entering another plane of existence. Most other interstellar drives also operate by using planar jumps. However, planar travel outside the Drift involves extremely expensive magical technology, often in concert with divine assistance, and such magic is usually tightly controlled by the groups and organizations that use it. As a result, Drift technology is the most commonly available means of interstellar travel, and ships using other methods to travel between stars are relatively rare. More guidelines on incorporating these alternative modes of travel can be found in the sidebar on page 9.</p><h3>Non-Drift Travel in your Game</h3><p>Drift engines are the most widely used technology in the galaxy for interstellar travel, and the Starfinder RPG assumes that all starships use the Drift for journeying between worlds. The interstellar drives presented in this section are generally restricted to certain faiths or organizations and are intended primarily for NPC use. As always, the GM has final say on whether PCs have access to these starship systems, but be aware that adding these options could challenge the baseline assumptions of your game. While these alternative interstellar drives aren’t more powerful than standard Drift engines, they might introduce complications for certain types of stories.</p><p>If you want to outfit a published starship with one of these new options (such as giving an Inheritorworks Cathedralship an archon drive), you can simply replace the Drift engine with the interstellar drive and update the ship’s Drift rating to match the rating of the new drive. The ship’s BP total and PCU rating will likely not be completely accurate, but the discrepancies should not have much of an impact on play, especially if the ship appears only in a single encounter. Alternatively, you can rebuild the ship from scratch using the new engine, but you will likely have to make other adjustments to the ship’s stat block to accommodate the interstellar drive’s BP cost and PCU requirements.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"v0UfAHfdsXIiY95b","name":"Alternate Interstellar Navigation","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>SOM pg. 8</p><p>Traveling through the Drift relies on Drift beacons for navigation, and these beacons effectively divide the galaxy into two zones: Near Space (regions close to Drift beacons) and the Vast (everywhere else). These distinctions are meaningless to starships without Drift technology; the density of Drift beacons in a given region of space has no bearing on travel times through planes other than the Drift. Likewise, Absalom Station’s Starstone has no effect on travel outside the Drift—it takes just as long for a ship without Drift tech to reach Absalom Station as it does to get to any other point in that system.</p><p>For most of the non-Drift interstellar engines presented here, travel times are the same whether a ship’s destination is in Near Space or the Vast, and the actual distance between the starting point and the destination doesn’t matter. With the exception of fold gates, traveling within a system takes about 1d6 days, and traveling anywhere in the galaxy takes about 5d6 days (the same as travel to the Vast via the Drift), though more powerful engines can reduce this time. When traveling to a world using a non-Drift interstellar drive, roll the travel time, then divide the result by the engine rating of your starship’s interstellar drive to determine how long it takes you to reach your destination. For example, a starship with a planar aperture drive (engine rating of 2) traveling to a planet elsewhere in the galaxy would roll 5d6 and divide the result by 2. If you rolled 15, then the trip would take 7-1/2 days (don’t round down travel rolls). As with Drift travel, days spent traveling through other planes are no different for a crew than days spent in normal space. A starship can stop while traveling through another plane, but such breaks don’t count toward your travel time.</p><p>Interstellar travel through planes other than the Drift has its perils, as the planes of the Great Beyond are often more dangerous than the Drift. The risk of random encounters when traveling through other planes is always higher than in the Drift.</p><p>As with Drift-capable starships, for a starship to activate its interstellar drive to either exit or enter the Material Plane, it must remain stationary with its conventional thrusters turned off for 1 minute.</p><ul><li><strong>Travel In-System (1d6 Days):</strong> Jumping between two points in the same solar system is moderately faster than moving between them in real space, but there is a 10% chance of random encounters on the plane being traversed.</li><li><strong>Travel In-Galaxy (5d6 Days):</strong> Regardless of the target location or plane traversed, traveling to another location in the galaxy takes the same amount of time, and the risk of random encounters on that plane can be anywhere from 40% to 60%.</li><li><strong>Travel Beyond the Rim:</strong> While technology capable of carrying a ship to another galaxy might exist, it is unknown to the galaxy at large; intergalactic travel using either Drift technology or non-Drift interstellar drives is currently impossible.</li></ul>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"xSsGm5CDn46XYCIB","name":"Interstellar Drives","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>SOM pg. 9</p><p>The interstellar drives below let you travel to distant star systems without using the Drift; their statistics appear here.

Interstellar drives have a PCU requirement and a maximum frame size. The cost in Build Points is based on the starship’s size category (for the purposes of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, and so on).

A ball of light hangs in the center of the engine, radiating rainbow light all over the ship’s engineering section and bathing the crew in color. Many ships equipped with archon drives hold regular worship services during interstellar journeys, as it is a common belief that the focused prayers of a ship’s crew can increase the drive’s efficiency.</p><p>Archon drives were in existence at the end of the Gap and were one of only a very few means of achieving interstellar travel before the advent of Drift tech, though they were— and still are—tightly controlled by the church of Iomedae.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.iAOgs89Z4Bw2IW48]{Chaos Sail}</h2><p>Chaos sails are engines powered by the churning evolutionary forces of change and possibility. Much like traditional sails bend the unpredictable wind to their advantage, chaos sails tap into the volatile energies of the roiling Maelstrom, enabling starships to travel through that plane to bypass interstellar distances. But raw chaos is difficult to harness, and chaos sails carry unpredictable risks—anything from the ships’ interior layouts rearranging, cargoes morphing into other goods, and even the laws of physics changing while in transit. Crews and passengers can be impacted as well, with pilots finding their flight controls now monitor power-core performance instead, or captains discovering that they must encourage or cajole their ship’s weapons to fire in combat.</p><p>Besmara is said to have created the first chaos sails for her ship, the Starwraith, driving it through the Maelstrom’s Cerulean Void and into other planes. Before the introduction of Drift travel, her pirate-priests were the primary users of chaos sails, and the especially devout continue to do so, trusting in Besmara’s favor to keep them safe from the hazards of the Maelstrom.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.cgbvvhi1SUvIKPAA]{Constellation Orrery}</h2><p>Almost every sapient culture has constellations—patterns of stars visible from a location that represent figures from mythology, folklore, or religion. Stories about these constellations have been shared for generations, cementing their shapes in the collective imagination of thousands of different worlds. Every planet has different constellations and stories attached, but they are all linked together in a mystical sense, as the use of constellation orreries proves.</p><p>A constellation orrery is a form of interstellar drive that enables starships to navigate along the imaginary lines that connect the stars in a constellation, using stars that appear in multiple constellations as “switching stations” to change lines. These constellation lines are similar to terrestrial ley lines, and they run through not just one plane, but many. Constellation orreries look similar to ancient mechanical solar system models that displayed the orbits of planets around a star, but they depict the relative positions of stars in a constellation, reconfiguring their appearance as the ship passes through different constellations. The Church of Ibra is the sole known purveyor of constellation orreries, but whether the drive’s origin lies in the Gap or before it is just another cosmic mystery for the faithful to decipher.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.5XGYJhtK8b2EZjLk]{Elemental Engine}</h2><p>Even starship crews native to the elemental planes commonly use Drift engines for most interstellar travel, but prior to the modern era, some elemental denizens made use of other plane-hopping engines to get to and from the Material Plane. Such travel was not without risk, as various factions constantly struggle for dominance over the elemental planes and are often hostile to unknown starships entering their territory.</p><p>Those elemental engines still in use are often found in the hands of smugglers, pirates, and other outlaws, who use these drives to avoid capture by escaping to the inhospitable expanses of one of the elemental planes, where most Material Plane law-enforcement agencies cannot pursue them. Of course, a Material Plane starship using an elemental engine must have some means of protecting the ship from the harmful planar energies it will endure during such transits. Vessels native to one of the elemental planes, however, are usually impervious to the energies of that plane.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.bDNnLgDQd23ehAr7]{First Drive}</h2><p>The First World is a plane of endless possibility and evolution. Initially created as something of a rough draft of the Material Plane, the First World constantly reinvents itself, with the laws of physics—even time—changing from one location to another. Another major difference between the First World and the Material Plane is that the First World has no outer space; it is mostly a single, immeasurable landmass. Nevertheless, it is possible to achieve interstellar travel on the Material Plane by using a so-called first drive to travel through the First World. The journey can be perilous, and more than one starship using a first drive has disappeared in transit, possibly abducted by the fey denizens of the First World.</p><p>The fey deities called the Eldest rule the First World, and those regions they control are some of the few areas of stability on the plane, held in place by the sheer will of the Eldest. A first drive enables a starship to navigate through the First World by using these stable realms as waypoints. Locations in the First World roughly correspond to physical locations on the Material Plane—for example, a portion of the First World corresponds to the planet Akiton. A starship in orbit around Akiton can activate its first drive to arrive in the Akiton portion of the First World, then travel through the plane to another planet’s corresponding First World location. When the ship reenters the Material Plane, it arrives close to that planet. Unfortunately, this means that a vessel equipped with a first drive must travel between two locations that existed at the time the First World was created. A first drive cannot be used to travel to or from a location that does not have a First World analog (such as a space station like Absalom Station or open space); any attempts to do so simply fail.</p><p>The Eldest are generally credited with creating the first drive; some planar scholars believe that Ng the Hooded was directly responsible. A more contested theory is that the first drive was a rough draft of Triune’s Drift engine, though no evidence to support such a claim has been brought to light, and neither the Eldest nor Triune have confirmed or denied these speculations. What is known is that the Eldest are the sole suppliers of first drives, and they usually offer them to mortal spacefarers only as part of inscrutable bargains.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.E0fhmZwZnpDRmguZ]{Fold Gates}</h2><p>Found in scattered locations deep in the Vast, fold gates are an ancient magical means of interstellar travel designed to foil the speed limit of the universe. Fold gates don’t enable a starship to travel at speeds faster than light—the magic “folds” the space between two gates instead, and a vessel simply passes through the gates in a near-instantaneous transition from one physical location to another.</p><p>Unfortunately, repeated use of fold gates caused strain on the most heavily traveled routes, weakening the fabric of space-time and in some cases stretching and ripping it like badly worn cloth, causing disasters such as the disappearance of entire star systems. Most of these dangerously distorted fold gate routes eventually disintegrated, with the gates themselves collapsing into black holes or becoming mystical hazards that can ensnare unwary ships in strange, labyrinthine demiplanes.</p><p>Fold gates are known to have been in use even before the Gap, but the original builders of the fold gates and the techniques for creating them have been lost to history. Some stable, functional fold gates still remain, but all the gates discovered to date have been found in the Vast, and the entire network of linked gates has yet to be fully mapped. Starship captains use fold gates at their own risk, but they remain an option for daring pilots seeking shortcuts through the galaxy.</p><p>Journeying between a pair of fold gates usually takes only 1d8 hours, but travel is limited to predetermined destinations—those locations with functioning fold gates (determined by the GM). Fold gates have no BP cost, as no special engines are needed to use them, but they drain an immense amount of power from vessels passing through them to maintain the stability of the folded space they create. Fold gates are physical objects, so only Huge or smaller starships can fit through them.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.arqNIzaPzKwiQjNs]{Helldrive}</h2><p>Just as the Church of Iomedae made early use of proprietary archon drives, so too did Asmodeans develop their own technology: Helldrives, which enable starships to travel through Hell itself to circumvent Material Plane distances. Today, Helldrives are most commonly found in the fleets of the Hellknights, supporting their mission to bring the rule of law to a chaotic universe.</p><p>Hell is a brutal and orderly plane; it is full of dangers for the unwary, but it honors its agreements. Each Helldrive functions as a physical contract permitting relatively easy—though rarely truly safe—passage through Hell. The Church of Asmodeus constructs each Helldrive individually, customized for the ship that will carry it, and only those who follow the strict tenets of Hell to the letter are allowed to use them. Helldrives run on fuel condensed from damned souls, and some planar scientists speculate that the very act of operating a Helldrive is akin to signing an infernal contract, with the user’s soul pledged to become fuel for the next generation of Helldrives.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.LKRMRPcCldRD76HM]{Planar Aperture Drive}</h2><p>The four-armed witchwyrds (Starfinder Alien Archive 122) have traveled the stars and planes since long before the Gap, using starships outfitted with proprietary hybrid interstellar engines called planar aperture drives. Manufactured by the Tetrad trade association, witchwyrds’ interplanar mercantile group, planar aperture drives open temporary portals to other planes, allowing witchwyrds to travel with ease throughout the galaxy and most other planes, including the Drift. Their navigational charts are a wonder to behold, though sometimes even witchwyrd ships arrive in the wrong place when traveling through ever-changing planes like the First World or the Maelstrom.</p><p>These drives are the only non-Drift engines known to access the Drift, though how they accomplish this is unknown—one of the leading theories posits the Tetrad signed an exclusive deal with Triune, giving its ships access to the Drift. In any case, the Tetrad does not sell its planar aperture drives to non-witchwyrds under any circumstance, and most Tetrad starships are equipped with security features like biometric locks or even self-destruct systems to keep the technology out of non-witchwyrd hands. On the rare occasions that such engines have been captured by outsiders, they work only as normal Signal Basic Drift engines.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.LHKVTDWIf0gmWFYc]{Shadow Engine}</h2><p>The Shadow Plane is a warped reflection of the Material Plane, and distances there are highly variable, making it possible to traverse vast distances in less time than it would take on the Material Plane—a fact some species exploited in early forms of faster-than-light starship travel. The shadow engines of velstracs and the Church of Zon-Kuthon were among the most prevalent of these technologies, which transition a starship from the Material Plane to the Shadow Plane by replicating the effects of the shadow walk spell on an interstellar scale. Early shadow engines were slower than Drift engines, but velstracs have continually refined the technology, and modern shadow engines are now just as fast as equivalent Drift-capable vessels.</p><p>Shadow engines can propel starships at incredible speeds, but such speed comes with a price: excruciating pain. Kuthites believe that pain leads to enlightenment and have built that tenet into their shadow engines, giving them the painful special property.</p><p><strong>Painful:</strong> When a shadow engine is first activated, every creature on the ship (crew and passengers) is wracked with agonizing pain that imposes a –2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, and skill checks (including for starship combat) for as long as the ship is on the Shadow Plane. A target that succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + the starship’s tier) reduces the duration to 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. Velstracs don’t take the penalties from this effect, though they do enjoy the pain the engine provides.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}
{"_id":"7MyEhuifQLwaPZ8e","name":"Senses","pages":[{"_id":"eRuw7PyvI33WDzvu","name":"Senses","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 260</p><p>Just as actions determine what you can do in combat and movement determines how you get there to do it, senses determine what you can perceive and how. Different alien races might have many different senses, but essentially all senses are separated into precise and imprecise senses. A specific creature’s senses are typically further refined into special abilities that more tightly detail how it perceives. These abilities include blindsight, blindsense, sense through, darkvision, and low-light vision, and the description of these abilities is found in Special Abilities beginning on page 262.</p><p>The broad definitions of creatures’ types of senses are below, followed by an explanation of how they function.</p><h2>Precise Senses</h2><p>Precise senses allow a creature to perceive the world in nuanced detail. For many creatures, the only precise sense they have is vision. Most other precise senses are collectively referred to as “blindsight,” indicating that they are precise like vision but creatures can use them without needing to see.</p><h2>Imprecise Senses</h2><p>Imprecise senses allow a creature to perceive certain details and clues about the world, which vary depending on the sense, but these are not sufficient for the creature to make out nuanced detail the way a human’s sight does. For many creatures, their nonvisual senses are imprecise. Some creatures have extremely keen imprecise senses that, while still insufficient to provide details like a precise sense would, can greatly help the creatures detect stimuli in the absence of their precise senses; such senses are collectively referred to as “blindsense.”</p><h2>Specific Sensing Mechanisms</h2><p>Creatures with blindsense or blindsight typically perceive using a specific sense mechanism, indicated in parentheses after blindsense or blindsight in the creature’s statistics. If this sense somehow becomes unusable, the creature loses access entirely to its blindsense or blindsight. The typical senses through which creatures can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</p><p>Specific entries for blindsense, blindsight, and other senses can be found in Special Abilities beginning on page 262.</p><h2>The Four States of Awareness</h2><p>In gameplay, there are four different states of awareness that you can have with regard to another creature, which determine, for example, whether you surprise it when you engage it in combat or whether you can target a creature with an attack. These states of awareness are described below. </p><h3>Unaware</h3><p> When you are unaware of another creature, you don’t even know it is present. Generally this occurs because the creature is hidden, you failed your Perception check to notice it, and the creature hasn’t yet performed any actions that would alert you to its presence. You cannot directly attack a creature you are unaware of, but it is subject to area effects. </p><h3>Aware Of Presence</h3><p> When you are aware of another creature’s presence, you don’t necessarily know exactly where it is. Typically this occurs when the hidden creature has taken some action that revealed its general presence in the area but has successfully used Stealth since then to hide its exact location. If you have succeeded at a Perception check to notice a creature with an imprecise sense other than blindsense, you are aware of the creature’s presence (if you have blindsense, a successful Perception check means you are aware of the creature’s location; see below). You cannot directly attack a creature if you are only aware of its presence, but it is subject to area effects affecting its location.</p><p>In order to directly attack such a creature, you must pinpoint its exact location with an additional Perception check to search (see page 144). If this check is successful and you are using an imprecise sense to pinpoint a creature, you become aware of the creature’s location (see Aware of Location below). If this check is successful and you are using a precise sense to pinpoint a creature, you are observing the creature (see Observing below). </p><h3>Aware Of Location</h3><p> When you are aware of a creature’s location, you know exactly where the creature is located, but you still can’t observe the creature with a precise sense such as vision. Generally, this occurs because you have blindsense, or because the creature is hidden but you have succeeded at a Perception check to search for the creature with an imprecise sense. You must at least be aware of a creature’s location in order to directly attack it, though it is considered to have total concealment from you (see page 253). It is, however, subject to area effects affecting that location. </p><h3>Observing</h3><p> When you are observing a creature, you can directly perceive the creature with a precise sense. Generally, this occurs when a creature is visible, when the situation makes it impossible for the creature use Stealth to hide, or when you have succeeded at a Perception check to search for the creature using a precise sense such as blindsight. You must be observing a creature to use a ranged effect that targets a specific creature without requiring an attack roll to hit (such as magic missile). You can also make normal attacks, including ones using ranged abilities, against creatures that you are observing. Again, it is subject to area effects that affect its location.</p><p>A creature currently being observed can’t attempt a Stealth check without first breaking that observation. To break observation, the creature must either mask itself from your precise senses (with darkness, fog, invisibility, or the like, but not with effects such as displacement that still leave a clear visual indicator of its location), move somewhere it can’t be observed (a place with cover, for example), or use Bluff to create a distraction to momentarily break your observation of it.<br /></p><h2>Dealing with Unseen Creatures</h2><p>If you are unaware of a creature, aware of a creature’s presence, or aware of a creature’s location, that creature is considered to be “unseen” for you. A stationary unseen creature has a +40 bonus to Stealth checks, but this bonus is reduced to +20 if the unseen creature moves (and these bonuses are negated for potential observers with blindsense). An unseen creature benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance) against attacks. In addition, you are considered flat-footed against an unseen creature’s attacks.</p><p>If you are unaware of a creature or aware only of its presence, you cannot directly attack it. You must first succeed at a Perception check to search for the creature’s location, which then allows you to become aware of the creature’s location (if using an imprecise sense) or to observe the creature (if using a precise sense). If an unseen creature makes a melee attack against you from a space adjacent to you, you automatically determine its location, though this doesn’t stop it from moving after the attack.</p><h2>Vision and Light</h2><p>Because the majority of creatures in the Starfinder RPG use vision as their only precise sense, it’s important to determine the limitations of vision. </p><h2>Bright Light</h2><p> All characters with vision can see clearly in bright light. Sources of bright light include direct sunlight outdoors, a nearby star shining through a starship viewport, powerful industrial lighting, or any source as bright or brighter than normal sunlight. </p><h2>Normal Light</h2><p> Normal light functions just like bright light, but it is less intense. Normal light includes the light conditions underneath a forest canopy during the day, typical indoor lighting, typical lighting on a starship, or the light shed by a star shaman’s starlight form. </p><h2>Dim Light</h2><p> In dim light, you can somewhat make out shapes, but you can’t see precise details well at all. Dim light includes moonlight outside at night and bright starlight, or a starship’s emergency backup lights. An area just beyond the range of a light source has dim light. Creatures within an area of dim light have concealment (20% miss chance; see page 253) from creatures without darkvision or the ability to see in darkness. Because dim light is not ideal for observation, if you’re in an area of dim light, you can attempt a Stealth check to conceal yourself from creatures without low-light vision, darkvision, or blindsight. Dim light does not affect creatures with low-light vision, which can see in dim light as if it were normal light. </p><h2>Darkness</h2><p> In darkness, creatures without darkvision effectively have the blinded condition (see page 273). Areas of darkness include an unlit chamber within a structure, most caverns, outside on a moonless night, or the surface of planets with distant or nonexistent stars. Unlike low-light vision and in areas of dim light, darkvision does not work exactly like normal vision in areas of darkness; rather, darkvision works only to a specified range and is in black and white.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}
{"_id":"AoGIedPXZpPJUbzz","name":"Tech Relics","pages":[{"_id":"NVIDoRTQe9ox2DFh","name":"Tech Relics","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":0,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> TR pg. 64</p><p>Relics of fallen civilizations, alternate timelines, or cultures vanished in the Gap are scattered throughout the galaxy, awaiting rediscovery. Each tech relic is indeed a lucky find, for they can’t normally be recreated with modern technological or even magical means. Their very construction often defies foundational principles of modern science.</p><p>Relics of ancient kishalee and sivv civilizations can be found in Starfinder Adventure Path #5: The Thirteenth Gate and Starfinder Adventure Path #33: Dominion’s End, respectively.</p><h2>Relics Overview</h2><p>Relics are rare, lost technologies less powerful than artifacts. They might be weapons, armor, or any other kind of equipment, but they can’t be crafted in a usual manner and are thus always special. Although relics have unusual abilities, each relic has a level—just like other equipment—to give a sense of its relative power and to indicate when it’s appropriate to introduce a relic in a campaign.</p><p>Relics frequently spur adventures. As relics can be of any level, they can appear in adventures designed for PCs that are starting characters or veteran heroes. The PCs might hear rumors of an unusual and possibly unique piece of equipment, prompting them to brave mysterious ruins or contend with cutthroat treasure-seekers to claim the relic as their prize. The PCs might have an enigmatic relic fall into their laps while completing some other task and undertake a new mission to find out what it is, how it works, or how to activate it. A patron might offer a relic as a reward, though an honest one will typically admit the relic might prove more powerful—or more dangerous—than it appears. A cache of relics makes a good hoard for an inscrutable, ancient, or time-displaced villain.</p><p>Relics are often unreliable. While PCs might learn some basics of a relic’s function by trial and error, the relic might work differently under variable conditions (such as when on another plane or used by certain creatures), glitch unexpectedly, or carry some unexpected detriment. Relics often use rare ammunition or batteries that can only be recharged under specific (and often unusual) circumstances; a relic with this type of limitation indicates this in its description. The GM can include other relic quirks or restrictions to keep the players on their toes, but be aware that such glitches might make the PCs regret having worked to collect such an unusual item in the first place!</p><p>The relics presented here are predominantly technological in their function, but they have such strange abilities that they might feel more like magic to the players. All relics, whatever their type, have the following rule.</p><p>Relic: A relic can be sold for 100% of the item’s price, like trade goods. A relic can’t be crafted without a specific (often long-lost) formula, and doing so often requires difficult-to-acquire materials. Even then, it’s rarely possible to recreate more than a few relics before expending the materials, depleting the required tools, or irrevocably warping the blueprints. A relic that becomes understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p><h2>Weapon Relics</h2><p>Weapon relics are abstruse devices discovered under mysterious circumstances. Unlike normal weapons, relic weapons don’t come fully loaded with ammunition unless noted, or unless they have some other indicated reloading method. They’re all treated as uncategorized weapons and are prone to unexpected backlash: on any attack roll of a natural 1, the user must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 the weapon’s level) or else the weapon deals damage to the user rather than the target. (Alternately, relics might use critical fumbles, from the Starfinder Critical Fumble Deck, even if those rules aren’t otherwise used in a campaign).</p><h2>Quirks</h2><p>A tech relic might have any of the following quirks, either randomly determined or specifically chosen.<br /><br /><strong>1. Burbling</strong>: The speech of anyone holding the relic becomes impossible to understand.<br /><strong>2. Crystalline</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it take double damage from sonic damage.<br /><strong>3. Fastidious</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it look clean, spotless, and new.<br /><strong>4. Floating</strong>: The relic can’t rest upon a surface, always hovering and slowly drifting away wherever it’s set down.<br /><strong>5. Keening</strong>: A mournful wail surrounds the relic unless it’s tightly wrapped up.<br /><strong>6. Marked</strong>: Anyone looking at the relic sees a maker’s mark or property tag bearing the viewer’s own name.<br /><strong>7. Menacing</strong>: Bystanders feel the relic is ineffably ominous. 8. Painful: The relic decreases the user’s pain threshold, imposing a –4 penalty to saving throws against pain effects.<br /><strong>9. Predictive</strong>: The relic often finishes the user’s sentences in the user’s voice.<br /><strong>10. Restless</strong>: The relic occasionally teleports itself 5–50 feet in a random direction when not carried or worn.<br /><strong>11. Shedding</strong>: The relic periodically sheds a shell that resembles its exterior, but the item never gets any smaller as a result.<br /><strong>12. Wasting</strong>: Any creature holding the relic seems unhealthy or dilapidated, taking a –2 penalty to saves against afflictions.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

If the result of your skill check equals or exceeds the difficulty class (also called the DC) of the task you are attempting, you succeed. If the total is less than the DC, you fail. Sometimes a task features varying degrees of success or failure depending on how much your result is above or below the required DC. The GM is responsible for determining the DCs of skill checks (see Skill DCs on page 392 for more details).</p><p>Often, using a skill requires taking an action, or it is taken as part of some other action. The action depends on the skill and the specific task listed in that skill. Each skill description details a number of common tasks for which that skill is used. Your GM will also prompt you to roll nonstandard skill checks when the circumstances of the game demand it.</p><p>Sometimes you attempt a skill check not to accomplish a task, but to thwart someone else’s task or action. This is called an opposed skill check. With an opposed skill check, one creature attempts a skill check to try accomplish some action or task, while another creature attempts its own skill check to determine the DC the first creature must meet or exceed to accomplish its goal. Typically, attempting an opposed skill check to determine the DC requires no action, but it often requires you to be conscious or have the ability to take certain types of actions when you do so.<br />On occasion, it’s impossible for you to attempt a skill check. Sometimes the situation prevents you from rolling a skill check, and other times the skill in question requires special training in order to attempt. Skills that require special training are called trained-only skills and are marked as such in their headings. Unless otherwise noted in the skill’s description, you can’t attempt an untrained skill check to accomplish a task using a trained-only skill; you must have at least 1 rank in that skill to attempt a check.</p><p>The table that begins the following page summarizes the differences between trained and untrained skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>SKILL CHECK TYPE</td><td>SKILL CHECK RESULT</td></tr><tr><td>Trained class skill</td><td><p>1d20 + skill ranks + 3 + ability score<br />modifier + other modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td>Trained skill</td><td><p>1d20 + skill ranks + ability score modifier<br />+ other modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td>Untrained skill</td><td><p>1d20 + ability score modifier + other<br />modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>* Armor check penalties apply to most Strength- and Dexterity-based<br />skill checks.</p></td><th></th></tr></tbody></table><h2>Take 10</h2><p>Most of the time, you attempt skill checks while under pressure or during times of great stress. Other times, the situation is more favorable, making success more certain.</p><p>When you are not in immediate danger or distracted, the GM might allow you to take 10 on a skill check. When you take 10, you don’t roll a d20, but rather assume that you rolled a 10 on that die, then add the relevant skill modifiers. For many routine tasks, or for tasks you are particularly skilled at, taking 10 ensures success. If you still fail when taking 10, you might require more time and energy to succeed at that task (see Take 20 below).</p><p>Unless you have an ability that states otherwise, you cannot take 10 during a combat encounter. Also, you can’t take 10 when the GM rules that a situation is too hectic or that you are distracted, and taking 10 is almost never an option for a check that requires some sort of crucial effect as a key part of the adventure's story.</p><h2>Take 20</h2><p>When you have plenty of time to devote to a skill’s task and that task has no adverse effect upon failure, the GM might rule that you can take 20 on that skill check. This is similar to taking 10, but instead of assuming your roll was a 10, you assume it’s a 20.</p><p>Taking 20 means you are making multiple attempts at the task until you get it right. It also assumes that you are failing many times before you succeed. Taking 20 typically takes 20 times as long as attempting a single check would take (usually 2 minutes for a skill that takes a standard action to perform).</p><h2>Aid Another</h2><p>The GM might rule that you can help someone succeed at a skill check by performing the same action and attempting a skill check as part of a cooperative effort.

Generally, you need to attempt an Acrobatics check while flying only if you attempt a difficult maneuver or are in dangerous wind conditions. Usually, these checks are attempted as part of a move action while flying.</p><p>You receive a bonus or penalty to Acrobatics checks to fly depending on your maneuverability: a –8 penalty for clumsy maneuverability, no bonus for average maneuverability, or a +8 bonus for perfect maneuverability.</p><p>The following situations require Acrobatics checks and have consequences for failure. The DCs for such checks are based on the current wind and air conditions and other factors determined by the GM. You can’t take 20 on Acrobatics checks to fly.</p><h3>Avoid Falling Damage</h3><ul><li> If you are falling and you can fly, you can attempt an Acrobatics check as a reaction to negate the damage from the fall. If you fail, you fall normally. If you have perfect maneuverability, you can avoid falling damage automatically without attempting a check.</li></ul><h3>Fly in Dangerous Wind Condition</h3><ul><li>The more violent the wind conditions, the more difficult it is to keep flying. In conditions of windstorm or higher (51+ mph; see page 400), you must attempt an Acrobatics check to stay aloft each time you move. If you fail this check, you cannot move. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you are blown 2d6 × 10 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind (or in a direction decided by the GM), and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. You can’t take 10 on Acrobatics checks to fly in dangerous wind conditions.</li></ul><h3>Hover</h3><ul><li>Safe flight typically requires momentum. If you wish to stay in place, or hover, while flying, you must attempt an Acrobatics check as a move action. If you fail, you fall. If you have clumsy maneuverability, you can’t hover at all. If you have average maneuverability and at least 5 ranks in Acrobatics or if you have perfect maneuverability, you can hover automatically without attempting a check; this does not require a move action.</li></ul><p>The DCs for Acrobatics checks to fly are based on the prevailing wind conditions. The following chart provides the base DCs for air conditions, whether an Acrobatics check is required to fly in those air conditions, and whether a creature can take 10 on an Acrobatics check to fly. These wind conditions typically represent fairly clear skies and consistent wind speeds. The DC increases by as much as 5 for choppy wind or airborne debris, or 10 for both.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>WIND<br />CONDITIONS</p></td><td style=\"width:20%\">DC</td><td><p>CHECK<br />REQUIRED?</p></td><td>TAKE 10?</td></tr><tr><td>Light to moderate (0–20 mph)</td><td>15</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Strong (21–30 mph)</td><td>17</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Severe (31–50 mph)</td><td>19</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Windstorm (51–74 mph)</td><td>27</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Hurricane force (75–174 mph)</td><td>33</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Tornado force (175+ mph)</td><td>39</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Tumble</h2><p>As long as you do not have the encumbered or overburdened condition (see pages 275–276), you can use Acrobatics to move through a space threatened by an enemy or enemies without provoking attacks of opportunity from them. Tumbling is a move action, and you move at half speed. The DC to move through an opponent’s threatened area is 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If multiple opponents are threatening the same space, you attempt one check with a DC based on the opponent with the highest CR, and the DC increases by 2 for each additional opponent beyond the first.<br />You can also tumble directly through an opponent’s space; the DC is 20 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If you fail this check, you stop moving adjacent to your opponent and provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If you attempt to move through multiple threatened spaces or opponents’ spaces during the same round, you must succeed at a check for each space, and the DC of each check beyond the first increases by 2. For example, if you tumble through a space threatened by two CR 1 creatures and a CR 2 creature, the DC = 15 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 22. If you then tumble through the space of the CR 2 creature, the DC = 20 + 3 + 2 = 25.</p><p>In all of these cases, the DC is modified by the same environmental circumstances that apply to the balance task of Acrobatics (see page 135). If you fail the check, you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. If you want to move at full speed while tumbling, you take a –10 penalty to the check. You can use Acrobatics to tumble while prone, but you can move only 5 feet as a full action and take a –5 penalty to the check. Use the following base DCs for Acrobatics checks to tumble.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>SITUATION</td><td style=\"width:40%\">DC*</td></tr><tr><td>Move through a threatened area</td><td>15 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td></tr><tr><td>Move through an enemy’s space</td><td>20 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td></tr><tr><td><p>* The DC increases by 2 for each additional threatened space or<br />opponent’s space you move through in 1 round</p></td><th></th></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx","name":"Athletics (Str; Armor Check Penalty)","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":900000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong>: CRB pg. 134</p><p>You can scale vertical surfaces, leap over obstacles, and swim.</p><h2>Climb</h2><p>As part of a move action, you can use Athletics to climb up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or another steep incline. You can even climb on a ceiling, provided it has handholds, but you cannot climb on a perfectly smooth surface. On a successful check, you move at half your land speed across such a surface. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall. You can’t take 20 on an Athletics check to climb. You need at least two hands to climb, but you can cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell, shoot a small arm, or take some other action that takes only one hand.

If you take a 10-foot running start just prior to the jump attempt, the DC is equal to the number of feet you are attempting to jump horizontally, or four times the number of feet you are attempting to jump vertically. If you do not take a running start, the DC of the check doubles. The DC is modified by the same environmental circumstances that apply to Acrobatics checks to balance (see page 135). If you fail the check, you fall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall prone even if you don’t take any damage from the fall. Creatures with a land speed of 35 feet or more gain a +4 bonus to Athletics checks to jump. This bonus increases by 4 for every 10 by which a creature's land speed exceeds 40 feet. You can’t take 20 on Athletics checks to jump.</p><h2>Swim</h2><p>As part of a move action, you can use Athletics to swim. On a successful check, you move half your land speed through water and similar fluids. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you sink beneath the surface or sink deeper, and you must hold your breath or begin drowning (see page 404). If you do not have a swim speed (see page 259), for each hour you swim, you must succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check or take 1d6 nonlethal damage from fatigue.

If you succeed, the creature you are lying to believes you are telling the truth, at least until confronted with evidence to the contrary. The GM may determine that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince someone they are true.</p><p>The DCs for Bluff checks to lie are adjusted based on the target’s initial attitude toward you (see Diplomacy on page 139) as well as other circumstances determined by the GM (such as the plausibility of the lie).<br /></p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Initial Attitude</strong></td><td><strong>DC Modifier</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hostile</strong></td><td><strong>+10</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Unfriendly</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Indifferent</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>Helpful</td><td>–5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Pass Secret Message</h2><p>You can use Bluff to pass a secret message to an ally without others understanding the message’s true meaning. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for more complex messages, as determined by the GM. Those overhearing the message can attempt an opposed Sense Motive check to learn the gist of the message.

Firewalls can block off specific sections of a computer and grant different users root access to those sections.</p><p>The base DC for many of the tasks of the Computers skill is equal to 13 + (4 × the computer’s tier). These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.</p><h2>Access Unsecured System</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Computers to access an unsecured computer system’s most basic functions. The DC to access the information or functions of a public computer with no countermeasures or firewalls is generally 10. Unlike other tasks of the Computers skill, you can attempt to access a system untrained if you take 20 on the task, requiring 2 minutes. Secured computer systems, and secured sections of an unsecured system, can be accessed by making a Computers check to hack a system.</p><h2>Craft Computer</h2><p>If you have enough ranks in Computers, you can build computers. See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p><h2>Create or Detect Forgery</h2><p>You can use Computers to forge official documents. This takes 1d4 minutes. The GM rolls the Computers check to create a forgery in secret, so you’re not sure how good your forgery is. This check is opposed by the Computers check of anyone who examines the document to determine its authenticity.</p><p>The DCs for Computers checks to detect a forgery are based on the type of forged document as well as other circumstances determined by the GM, as shown in the table below.<br /></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Circumstance</td><td>DC Modifier</td></tr><tr><td>Document contradicts knowledge or orders</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Type of document is well known to examiner</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Type of document is unknown to examiner</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Examiner only casually reviews document</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Forger has a sample of a similar document</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Destroy or Repair System or Module</h2><p>You can use Computers to repair a computer system or module that has been disabled, or destroy one that has been either removed or disabled by spending 10 minutes per tier of the computer system working on the computer. The DC is based on the tier of the computer system. If you are repairing a disabled module or system and you fail the check by 5 or more, you accidentally destroy the module or system. You can’t take 20 on a Computers check to destroy or repair a computer system.</p><h2>Detect Fake Shell</h2><p>If you have access to a computer, but not root access, you may actually only have access to a fake shell (see page 217). If you succeed at the check, which takes a full action, you realize that you have accessed a fake shell. The DC is equal to the DC to hack the computer + 5 (see Table 7–22: Computer Tiers on page 214).</p><h2>Disable or Manipulate Module</h2><p>A character with root access to a computer can disable or manipulate a countermeasure or module as a standard action with a DC 10 Computers check. If you have access (but not root access) to a computer, you can attempt a Computers check to activate, add, disable, or manipulate any countermeasure or module. If you want to affect a countermeasure or module that is behind a firewall, you must first hack the system (see below) to gain access to it. Activating or disabling a countermeasure or module generally takes a standard action. Adding or removing a module generally takes 1 minute per tier of the computer. All of these tasks have a DC equal to the DC to hack the system. You cannot take 20 on a Computers check to disable or manipulate a module.</p><h2>Gain Root Access</h2><p>If you have access to a computer, you can attempt to upgrade your authorization to gain root access. This works similar to hacking the same computer, but the DC is 20 higher. In many cases it is impossible to gain root access, and every task beyond the computer’s basic functions must be attempted as a separate check to destroy, repair, disable, or manipulate modules or countermeasures. If a firewall has been set to have a different set of authorized users with root access, you must gain root access to it separately. Once you have root access to a computer, you can alter who else is granted root access with a successful Computers check to hack the system.</p><h2>Hack System</h2><p>You can use Computers to hack a computer system to which you don’t already have access. Hacking a computer system typically takes one full action per tier of the computer system. You can cut this time in half (to a minimum of one full action) for every 5 by which you increase the DC of the Computers check. If you succeed at the check, you gain access to any part of the computer that is not behind a firewall (see page 217). This allows you to use the basic functions of the computer and to make further checks that require you to have access. Accessing parts of a computer behind a firewall requires an additional Computers check for each firewall.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"LeZmnFwnlB89ovBB","name":"Culture (Int; Trained Only)","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":1200000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 139</p><p>You are a student of the vast number of known cultures in the galaxy, and you have a deep and rich understanding of the undercurrents of cultures and language in general.

It takes at least 1 minute to decipher approximately 250 words of writing or fewer. The GM often rolls Culture checks to decipher writing in secret. If you succeed at the check, you understand the general content of the text. If you fail, you don’t understand the text.

Attitudes fall into five categories (from worst to best): hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful. You can use Diplomacy to change a creature’s initial attitude to a more positive one, but at the risk of angering the creature and worsening its attitude toward you if you fail. This is a language-dependent ability. The creature must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher, and you must spend at least 1 minute interacting and conversing with the creature to change its attitude. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Diplomacy skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR (or the encounter’s CR, if you are trying to change the attitude of a group of creatures), whichever is higher. The DC is modified by the creature’s initial attitude (see page 140) and other circumstances, as determined by the GM. If you succeed, the creature’s attitude improves by one category (for instance, a hostile creature becomes unfriendly). If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you can choose to spend 10 more minutes interacting with the creature to improve its attitude by one additional category. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you anger the creature, and the creature’s attitude worsens by one category (for instance, a friendly creature becomes indifferent).</p><p>Attacking a creature always worsens its attitude by one category for each attack made, and may have other consequences based on the creature’s current attitude.</p><p>Positively affecting a creature’s attitude takes time. You typically can't use Diplomacy to positively change a creature’s attitude by more than one category (or two categories if you spend the extra time) within a 24-hour period, unless the GM decides otherwise or you have an ability that allows you to do so.</p><p>The five categories of initial attitude are described below, along with the effects of negatively changing each attitude.</p><h4>HOSTILE</h4><p>A hostile creature would rather attack you either physically or verbally, than civilly converse with you. Most enemies you meet are hostile. It’s often hard to talk diplomatically with hostile creatures, though it can be done remotely (via a communication device) or by avoiding combat with the creatures while persuading them to listen to reason. If you fail the Diplomacy check by 5 or more, you can’t attempt to change a hostile creature’s attitude again for 24 hours.</p><hr /><h4>UNFRIENDLY</h4><p>Unfriendly creatures are typically wary of you, or afraid you will try to hurt them if they aren’t careful or fail to keep you at bay. Unfriendly creatures become hostile when angered or attacked.</p><hr /><h4>INDIFFERENT</h4><p>Indifferent creatures take little notice of you, but hold no ill will against you. They don’t care about your plight, but may give you simple advice or directions. Most creatures you meet in everyday life or in settlements are indifferent. Indifferent creatures become unfriendly when angered or attacked.</p><hr /><h4>FRIENDLY</h4><p>Either due to a generally cheerful disposition or a predisposition to like you, friendly creatures treat you with kindness and respect. They may give you more-detailed advice or simple aid, but generally won’t go out of their way to be helpful. If angered or attacked, friendly creatures become indifferent and often try to avoid further contact with you if possible.</p><hr /><h4>HELPFUL</h4><p>Helpful creatures are not only friendly, but desire to help you, within reasonable means. Helpful creatures typically give you more lengthy or difficult aid, or offer small services that are readily available to them. When angered or attacked, helpful creatures become friendly, but somewhat guarded, as they are often confused by such reactions to their generosity.</p><p>The DCs for Diplomacy checks to change attitudes are adjusted based on the creature’s initial attitude as well as other circumstances determined by the GM.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>INITIAL ATTITUDE</th><th>DC MODIFIER</th></tr><tr><td>Hostile</td><td>+10</td></tr><tr><td>Unfriendly</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Indifferent</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>Helpful</td><td>—*</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* You cannot improve a creature’s attitude above helpful.</p><h2>Gather Information</h2><p>You can use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual. You must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people within a settlement or local region. If you succeed, you learn something about that topic or individual, though the GM may determine that some information is simply unknown to the local people.</p><p>The DCs for Diplomacy checks to gather information are based on the nature of the information being sought and may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances, such as bribes or gifts.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>INFORMATION SOUGHT</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Common facts or rumors</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Obscure or secret knowledge</td><td>20 or more</td></tr><tr><td>Prominent or well-known individual</td><td>5 + character’s CR</td></tr><tr><td>Average or ordinary individual</td><td>10 + character’s CR</td></tr><tr><td>Mysterious or obscure individual</td><td>15 + character’s CR</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"aayAhTaRzitONs5U","name":"Disguise (Cha)","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":1400000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 140</p><p>You are able to change your appearance to blend in and deceive others, whether to infiltrate</p><h2>Change Appearance</h2><p>You can use Disguise to change your appearance with 1d3 × 10 minutes of work with a disguise kit, by casting a spell such as disguise self, or by using a technological device such as a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.BqC7LI0RlKsBmgAH]{holoskin}. The GM rolls the Disguise check in secret, so you’re not sure how good your disguise is. This check is opposed by the Perception check (see page 144) of anyone who might realize that you are not who you appear to be. If you are not drawing attention to yourself, other creatures do not usually get to attempt a Perception check to pierce your disguise. If creatures are being particularly alert for suspicious activity (such as security personnel on a starship or space station), it’s assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.</p><p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you’re changing your appearance.

This takes 1 minute to connect the detonator and set the explosive. The DC of this check is typically 10. If you fail the check, you can attempt to arm the explosive again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you trigger the explosive prematurely.</p><p>You can also attempt to build an explosive more difficult to disarm.

If you fail the check, you can retry it after 24 hours.</p><h2>Craft Tech Item</h2><p>If you have enough ranks in Engineering, you can create technological devices or items (including computers). See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p><h2>Disable Device</h2><p>You can use Engineering to disable a lock, a trap, or a mechanical or technological device, or to disarm an explosive, as long as the device is unattended and you can access it. The amount of time this takes depends on the complexity of the device but typically requires at least one full action. The DC of the check is determined by the GM and is based on the complexity of the device. For extremely complex devices or systems, the GM might require multiple checks. The GM rolls the Engineering check to disable a device in secret, so you don’t necessarily know whether your attempt has succeeded or failed. If you succeed, you disable the device. If you fail the check and discover your error, you can attempt to disable the device again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is an explosive or a trap, you trigger it. If you are attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p><p>You can also use the disable device task to rig a device to work normally for a while, and then become disabled sometime later. This increases the DC of the check by 5. If you want to leave no trace of your tampering, the DC increases by an additional 5. If you succeed at the check, you can rig the device to become disabled up to 1 round later for each rank of Engineering you have. If you fail the check by 5 or more, your efforts have the same effect as if you were merely attempting to disable the device.</p><p>Due to the danger, you cannot take 20 on an Engineering check to disable a device.</p><p>The DC for an Engineering check to disable a device is based on the complexity of the device. The following chart provides base DCs by complexity, examples of such devices, and the time it takes to disable such devices. The GM can adjust these DCs and times to reflect other circumstances.

Generally, a check is not required to identify relatively simple technological items that are commonly available in the Pact Worlds (such as those items presented in Chapter 7).

The amount of time this takes typically depends on the complexity of the object. You can repair an object or piece of equipment you crafted in half the usual time. The DC of the check is determined by the GM and based on the complexity of the object. If you succeed, you restore a number of Hit Points equal to the result of your Engineering check. If you fail the check by 10 or more, you damage the object further, dealing 1d4 damage to it; this damage can’t reduce an item to fewer than 1 HP.</p><p>If the object or piece of equipment is damaged but not broken, you can repair it at no cost.

See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p><h2>Disable Magic Device</h2><p>You can use Mysticism to disable a magical trap or other magical item. This functions as the disable device task of the Engineering skill, and the DC of the check is based on the trap itself. You can’t take 20 on a Mysticism check to disable a magic device.</p><h2>Identify a Spell Being Cast</h2><p>If you can clearly observe a spell being cast, you can use Mysticism to identify the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + 5 × the level of the spell being cast. This does not require an action. You can’t take 10 or 20 on a Mysticism check to identify a spell.</p><h2>Identify Creature</h2><p>You can use Mysticism to identify constructs with the magical subtype, dragons, fey, magical beasts, outsiders, and undead (see page 133).</p><h2>Identify Creature</h2><div><p>As part of the action to cast detect magic, you can use Mysticism to identify the properties and command words of magic items. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × the item level. You can usually attempt a Mysticism check to identify a magic item only once per 24-hour period; further attempts within that period fail. However, casting an identify spell allows you to attempt a second check in the same 24-hour period and grants you a +10 insight bonus to the check. If you have the time, you can take 20 to attempt another check to identify a magic item in the same 24- hour period, but only if you can perform research, such as with access to an information network or downloaded data set.</p></div><h2>Recall Knowledge</h2><p>You can use Mysticism to recall knowledge about alchemical theory, arcane symbols, deities, magic traditions, the planes, religious traditions and symbols, and related topics (see page 133).</p><h2>Repair Item</h2><p>You can use Mysticism to repair a magical or hybrid piece of equipment, as long you have access to it. This typically takes 1 hour. You can repair a piece of equipment you crafted in half the usual time. The DC of the check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × item level. For a magical object without an item level, the GM determines the DC and the amount of time it takes to repair the object based on the object’s complexity (see the repair item task of the Engineering skill on page 142 for guidelines). If you succeed, you restore a number of Hit Points equal to the result of your Mysticism check. If you fail the check by 10 or more, you damage the item further, dealing 1d4 damage to it; this damage can’t reduce an item to fewer than 1 HP.<br />If the piece of equipment is damaged but not broken, you can repair it at no cost. If it is broken but not destroyed, you must spend 10 UPBs per item level (see page 233) each time you attempt to repair it. A destroyed piece of equipment can’t be repaired with the Mysticism skill.<br />You can’t take 20 on a Mysticism check to repair an item or an object.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP","name":"Perception (Wis)","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 144</p><p>You can use all of your senses (hearing, taste, touch, sight, and smell) to notice danger, pick out fine details, and search for hidden objects or creatures.</p><h2>Notice</h2><p>You can use Perception to notice things happening around you. This is the most basic task of the Perception skill. It can be used for a variety of reasons determined by the GM. You might attempt a Perception check to see if you can act in a surprise round, to spot something important out of the corner of your eye, or to realize there are hidden creatures nearby (though you can’t notice a creature that is invisible unless it makes itself known; see page 264). A Perception check to notice usually does not involve taking an action, though you must be conscious and have the use of at least some of your senses to do so. The GM determines the DC. You cannot take 20 on a Perception check to notice things.<br />The DCs for Perception checks to notice things are determined by the GM based on the circumstances and may be adjusted to reflect other conditions. See the search task below for a chart with some example circumstances and their typical DCs.</p><h2>Pierce Disguise</h2><p>As a move action, you can use Perception to recognize that a creature has changed its appearance. Sometimes, if you are being particularly alert for those in the area who might be in disguise, the GM might allow you to do this without taking an action. This check is opposed by a Disguise check attempted by the disguised creature. If you succeed, you realize the creature is disguised and not who it seems, but not necessarily who or what the disguised creature is beneath that disguise. If the disguised creature is impersonating a particular individual that you know, the GM might grant you a bonus to your Perception check.<br />Divination magic or scanners that allow you to see through illusions or holograms do not penetrate mundane and low-tech disguises, but they can negate illusory or holographic components of a disguise.<br />The DCs for Perception checks to pierce a disguise are adjusted according to how familiar the observer is with the particular individual the disguised creature is masquerading as, as well as other circumstances determined by the GM.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>FAMILIARITY</th><th>DC MODIFIER</th></tr><tr><td>Intimate</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td>Close friends</td><td>–8</td></tr><tr><td>Friends or associates</td><td>–6</td></tr><tr><td>Recognizes on sight</td><td>–4</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Search</h2><p>As a move action, you can use Perception to search for something in particular, such as finding an invisible creature that has made itself known or a hidden creature you know is in the area, or looking for nearby traps or hazards. You can also search an area to find anything of interest that might be hidden or is otherwise not immediately noticeable, such as concealed cargo compartments or hidden treasure. In that case, it takes 1 minute to search an area no more than 20 feet by 20 feet (or smaller, if the GM rules the area is particularly cluttered or complex). The DC is determined by the Stealth check of the creature, by the trap or hazard involved, or by the GM. If you are not in combat, you can take 20 on a Perception check to search.<br />The DCs for Perception checks to search may be adjusted by the GM based on the circumstances and to reflect other conditions.

This lets you direct your vehicle or ship in your desired heading and to plot longer courses. Plotting a course to a star system you have visited frequently usually requires a successful DC 10 Piloting check and takes 10 minutes.

You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession’s daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p><p>Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks. While skills like Culture, Life Science, Mysticism, and Physical Science represent highly specialized fields of study, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. When you put ranks in a Profession skill, you must choose the ability score keyed to that skill: Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. Common Charisma-based Profession skills include actor, artist, comedian, con artist, courtesan, dancer, musician, orator, poet, politician, video personality, and writer. Common Intelligence-based Profession skills include accountant, archaeologist, architect, corporate professional, electrician, lab technician, lawyer, mathematician, philosopher, professor, psychologist, and vidgamer. Common Wisdom-based Profession skills include bounty hunter, cook, counselor, dockworker, farmer, gambler, general contractor, herbalist, maintenance worker, manager, mercenary, merchant, miner, and smuggler.</p><p>A Profession skill should not overlap with existing skills. For example, if you want to play a scientist, you should put ranks into Life Science or Physical Science rather than create a Profession (scientist) skill. The GM is the final arbiter of what is a good choice for a Profession skill and what ability score a given Profession skill is keyed to.</p><p>Different professions are considered different skills for the purpose of how many ranks you can have each level. For example, a 4th-level character could have 4 ranks in both Profession (dockworker) and Profession (vidgamer).</p><h2>Earn a Living</h2><p>You can use Profession to earn money. A single check generally represents a week of work, and you earn a number of credits equal to double your Profession skill check result.

At any time, if you doubt something another creature is telling you, you can request the GM to allow you to attempt a Sense Motive check to determine whether it is deceiving you. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter; otherwise, it’s a move action. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by that creature’s Bluff check. If you succeed, you realize that you are being deceived or that a lie is being told, but not how it is untrue, nor does it let you know the truth. If you fail (or if no deception or lie is being made), you believe that the speaker doesn’t seem to be deceiving you. Failing the check by 5 or more may mean (at the GM’s discretion) you believe that a truthful statement contains deceptions or that a lie or deception is a truthful statement.</p><h2>Discern Secret Message</h2><p>If you overhear or otherwise intercept a secret message, you can use Sense Motive to learn the gist of its true meaning. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by a Bluff check attempted by the creature passing the secret message. If you succeed, you learn the information contained in the secret message. If you fail (or if there is no secret message), you don’t detect any hidden meaning in the message. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you might infer false information, as determined by the GM. Often, the GM rolls these checks in secret and informs you of the results.</p><h2>Sense Mental Effect</h2><p>You can use Sense Motive to ascertain whether another creature within 30 feet is affected by a mental effect, even if the creature is unaware of the effect. You must spend at least 1 minute interacting with the creature. The DC of this check is typically 25, but it can be higher or lower based on how overt the manifestation of the mental effect is, as determined by the GM. Knowing that a creature is under a mental effect does not automatically determine the nature of the mental effect, though outward signs and the subtleties of behavioral change may provide enough clues to attempt an Intelligence-based skill check or an Intelligence check to determine the nature of the mental effect, at the GM’s discretion.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"qVEW9HjXQN0ok879","name":"Sleight of Hand (Dex; Armor Check Penalty; Trained Only)","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2700000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 146</p><p>You can hide small objects, pick pockets, and accomplish other feats of manual dexterity without being noticed.</p><h2>Entertain</h2><p>You can use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience, as if you were using the earn a living task of the Profession skill.</p><h2>Hide Object</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Sleight of Hand to hide a small object (including a small arm or a one-handed melee weapon with light bulk) on your body. The check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone observing you or searching your body. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus to the check. Especially small objects or those created to be easy to hide can grant up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your Sleight of Hand check to hide an object on your person, as can compartments in clothing or armor made to facilitate such hiding. Retrieving a weapon or object hidden on your person is a standard action.</p><h2>Palm Object</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Sleight of Hand to palm a small object no larger than a small communicator or memory stick. The check is opposed by the Perception checks of anyone nearby who could notice the attempt. If you successfully use the Bluff skill to create a diversion, you gain a +10 bonus to this check (see Bluff on page 137). If you fail, you still palm the object, but not without being noticed by those whose Perception check results exceed your Sleight of Hand result. You can’t take 20 on a Sleight of Hand check to palm an object.</p><h2>Pick Pocket</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Sleight of Hand to steal an object from another creature. The DC of this check is usually 20, but it can be modified by any precautions the object’s wearer has taken, as determined by the GM.

You can attempt a Stealth check to hide either as a move action (if you are planning to stay immobile) or as part of a move action. If you move at a rate of half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Stealth check. If you attempt to hide while moving more than half your speed or after creating a diversion with Bluff, you take a –10 penalty to your Stealth check; these penalties are cumulative if you do both. The check is opposed by the Perception checks of creatures in the area that might detect you. A creature that fails the opposed skill check treats you as if you had total concealment as long as you continue to have actual cover or concealment. A creature that succeeds at the opposed skill check either sees you or pinpoints you (see page 260) in situations when you have total concealment. If you lose actual cover or concealment during your turn, you can attempt to stay hidden, but only if you end your turn within cover or concealment.</p><h3>Invisibility and Hiding</h3><p>If you are invisible or benefit from total concealment, you gain a +40 bonus to your Stealth check as long as you remain immobile. You are considered immobile if it is your turn and you have not yet moved or if you have not moved since the start of your last turn. If you are invisible but not immobile, you instead gain a +20 bonus to your Stealth check. Typically, a creature cannot attack you if you are invisible or have total concealment unless the creature pinpoints you with a successful Perception check. (Invisible creatures can still be heard, smelled, and felt, and might do something to make themselves known to those who succeed at Perception checks; see Invisible on page 264 in Chapter 8.) Even then, the attacking creature has a 50% miss chance against the pinpointed creature.</p><hr /><h3>Attacking From Hiding</h3><p>If you are successfully hiding from a creature, that creature is considered flat-footed for the purpose of your first attack from hiding. If you remain invisible after your first attack, that creature is considered flat-footed against your attacks until it succeeds at a Perception check to locate you or until you become visible.</p><h2>Sniping</h2><p>If you have already successfully used Stealth to hide from a creature that is at least 10 feet away, you can briefly pop out of cover or concealment and make a single ranged attack against that creature.

Typically, one check determines the success of your efforts for a single day. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude saving throws against severe weather while moving up to half your overland speed, or a +4 bonus if you remain stationary and build a temporary shelter. You can grant this bonus to one other creature for every 1 point by which your result exceeds the DC. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to endure severe weather.</p><h2>Follow Tracks</h2><p>You can use Survival to either find tracks or follow tracks you have found for 1 mile or until they become difficult to follow, whichever occurs first. Finding tracks requires a full action. If you move at half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Survival check. You can move at your full speed with a –5 penalty to the check or at twice your normal speed with a –20 penalty to the check.<br />The base DCs for Survival checks to follow tracks depend on the surface and are adjusted based on prevailing conditions and the group being tracked; such modifiers are cumulative. The GM may further adjust DCs to reflect other circumstances such as the number of creatures being tracked, local gravity, and weather conditions.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>SURFACE</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Very soft ground (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud)</td><td style=\"width:20%\">5</td></tr><tr><td>Soft ground (soft earth, drying mud)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Firm ground (fields, woods, thick rugs, dirty or dusty floors)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hard ground (bare rock, most flooring)</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><th>CONDITION</th><th>DC MODIFIER</th></tr><tr><td>Multiple creatures in group being tracked</td><td>–1 per three creatures</td></tr><tr><td>Time since tracks were made</td><td>+1 per 24 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Moonlight</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Overcast or moonless night</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>Tracked group moves at half speed and hides trail</td><td>+5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Handle an Animal</h2><p>As a move action, you can use Survival to improve the attitude of an animal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. This functions just like a Diplomacy check to change a person’s initial attitude, but it is not language-dependent. A typical domesticated animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><h2>Live off the Land</h2><p>You can use Survival to keep yourself and others fed in the wild by hunting and foraging, enabling you to move up to half your overland speed without needing food and water supplies. Typically, one check determines the success of your efforts for a single day. You can provide food and water for one other character for every 2 points by which the result of your check exceeds 10. In some cases, an environment may be so inhospitable (such as an airless asteroid) that it is impossible to live off the land. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to live off the land.</p><h2>Orienteering</h2><p>Once each hour while traveling through unfamiliar terrain and each time you move close to a natural hazard such as quicksand or patches of poisonous atmosphere, you can use Survival to keep from getting lost or to notice or avoid the hazard.</p><h2>Predict Weather</h2><p>You can use Survival to predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. You must spend at least 1 minute observing the surrounding area and its current weather patterns. You can predict the weather an additional day in advance for every 5 points by which your result exceeds 15. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to predict weather.</p><h2>Rear a Wild Animal (Trained Only)</h2><p>You can use Survival to raise a wild animal from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to use this task to rear wild creatures other than animals. Rearing a wild animal typically takes months or even years. If you succeed at the check at the end of this time, the animal is domesticated and has an initial attitude of friendly toward you. You can rear as many as three animals of the same kind at one time.</p><h2>Ride a Creature</h2><p>You can use Survival to ride an animal or another beast as a mount. The most typical actions while riding a creature don’t require checks. As a move action, you can either mount, ride (using the mount’s speed instead of yours), or dismount from a creature. Saddling a creature typically takes at least 1 minute, but the process could take longer if you’re using an unusual saddle or mount.<br />The following actions do require Survival checks.</p><h4>CONTROL MOUNT IN BATTLE</h4><p>You can attempt to control a mount not normally trained for combat while in battle. This is part of whatever action you are attempting to have the mount accomplish. If you fail the check, you lose that action.</p><hr /><h4>COVER</h4><p>As a swift action, you can drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail the check, you don’t gain the benefit of cover, and you can’t attack or cast until you use a move action to pull yourself back up. Pulling yourself back up doesn’t require a check.</p><hr /><h4>FAST MOUNT OR DISMOUNT</h4><p>You can attempt to mount or dismount from a creature as a swift action instead of a move action.</p><hr /><h4>FIGHT FROM A COMBAT-TRAINED MOUNT</h4><p>When you direct a mount trained for combat into battle, you must attempt a Survival check to ride as a swift action. If you succeed at the check, you can still make your own attacks as normal, along with any attacks the mount can make. If you fail the check, either you or your mount can make attacks, but not both.</p><hr /><h4>GUIDE WITH KNEES</h4><p>As part of a move action to ride a creature, you can guide it with your knees, keeping both of your hands free. If you fail the check, you must use one hand to guide your mount.</p><hr /><h4>LEAP</h4><p>As part of a move action, you can guide your mount to leap over an obstacle. If you succeed at the check, the mount must still succeed at an Athletics check to jump, but it can use your ranks in Survival in place of its ranks in Athletics, if that number is greater. If you fail the initial Survival check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage or 1d6 falling damage, whichever is greater.</p><hr /><h4>SOFT FALL</h4><p>As a reaction, you can reduce the damage you take from a fall off your mount (see page 400). With a successful check, you reduce the damage you take form the fall by 1d6.</p><hr /><h4>SPUR MOUNT</h4><p>As a move action, you can attempt to spur your mount to greater speeds. If you succeed at the check, the mount’s speed increases by 5 feet for that move action, but the mount takes 1d3 damage whether or not the check succeeds or fails. You can use this ability as often as you want, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the mount becomes fatigued.

This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.</p><p>Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.</p><p>Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. On a failed save, if the victim was affected by a condition as a result of the affliction and that condition was removed (such as by remove condition), the victim regains any conditions from earlier steps along the affliction’s progression track (as well as conditions from the current step). A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).</p><p>Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.</p><p><strong>Curing an Affliction:</strong> Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.d4fcGwOcrsuYrwGH#long-term-care]{Long-Term Care} on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.</p><p>Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.</p><p>Usually, the spell @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction} immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track).

However, only a patient demolitionist with the proper training can blow the lid off a crate without scratching the contents, collapse a bridge at an opportune moment, or vaporize a wall to launch a devastating surprise attack.</p><p>The Starfinder Core Rulebook lays out basic rules for arming and activating explosives on pages 141 and 218, though the installation speed and grenade payload better represent an anti-personnel trap than one meant to inflict structural damage. Even a typical door’s hardness and Hit Points are enough to withstand most grenades, making the ordnance required to break a door fairly cost-prohibitive. Anyone who wants to inflict property damage, such as to a door or wall, is better off using the optional demolitions system presented here, along with the expanded rules for the assess stability task of the Engineering skill found in the sidebar on page 69.</p><h2>Demolitions</h2><p>You can use Engineering to arm @UUID[.oMZo3soyDWOVqq8X]{explosive charges} (page 69) that you can trigger later with a detonator (Core Rulebook 218). Applying an explosive charge to a surface typically takes 1 minute, plus 1 minute to program its detonator; this is the primary charge. You can also apply up to five secondary charges to the surface; this takes an additional minute per charge, and each secondary charge must be the same type and mark as the primary charge. After you set the charges, the GM rolls your Engineering check in secret, so you’re not sure how effective your explosive charges are. You gain a circumstance bonus to your Engineering check based on your primary explosive charge’s mark, and the bonus increases by 2 for each secondary charge applied to the surface. The total result can’t exceed the primary charge’s Maximum Result (see @UUID[.TmE9rf9dDSvRMOeD]{Table 2–17: Explosive Charges} on this page). The Engineering check DC to disable this explosive is equal to the result of this Engineering check minus the bonuses from secondary charges.</p><p>When you activate the detonator, the charges explode; this functions as a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.ftqreMQkNpYDxpxY#destroying-objects-using-strength]{Strength check to break the structure} (Core Rulebook 409) that uses your Engineering check’s result in place of the Strength roll. If the check is successful, the explosion breaks apart the structure, allowing movement through its space and preventing it from being closed again (such as for a door). On a success, the explosion also causes collateral damage, dealing fire and piercing damage equal to twice the explosive charge’s mark to all creatures and objects adjacent to the structure (Reflex for half) and filling the damaged area with dust and smoke that grants concealment for 1 round. For every 5 by which the Engineering check exceeds the break DC, the damaging explosion’s radius increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 5 additional feet × the charge’s mark) and its damage increases by an amount equal to the explosive charge’s mark. The total collateral damage can’t exceed the structure’s break DC.</p><p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, the explosion doesn’t harm the structure. If you fail the check by 9 or less, the explosion deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 item levels of the primary explosive charge (rounded up) to the structure; if the demolitions included secondary charges, each one increases the damage by 1d6 (or 2d6 if the secondary charges’ item levels are 10 or higher). If you fail the check by 4 or less, this damage also ignores half the structure’s hardness.</p><p><strong>Controlled Explosion:</strong> When applying explosive charges, you can take a –4 penalty to your Engineering check to limit the subsequent damage, allowing for precise explosions. Choose a number. If your Engineering check result when setting explosive charges exceeds this number, the result is instead reduced to this number.</p><p><strong>Embedded Charges:</strong> Through a combination of careful calculation and drilling holes in the surface to accommodate charges, you can maximize an explosion’s destructive potential. This process takes 10 minutes per charge, 5 minutes per charge of which requires the use of a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.tOtmTsXNEattXits]{laser torch} (Starfinder Armory 105). As you finish setting the charges, attempt an Engineering check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the primary charge’s item level). If you succeed and all charges used in an explosion are embedded in this way, apply a +2 circumstance bonus to the demolition’s Engineering check; the explosive charges’ maximum result increases by 5.</p><p><strong>Quick Demolitions:</strong> You can halve the time it takes to apply explosive charges, but doing so applies a –5 penalty to your Engineering check to determine the explosion’s result.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> Abilities and effects that allow you to increase the rate at which you arm explosives also apply to the demolitions task. If you have an ability that reduces the time required for a specific action (such as the demolition expert envoy expertise talent, Armory 145), you can take that action to arm a single charge.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

The following section describes how effects’ areas, descriptors, durations, ranges, and targets work, and it also gives the mechanical definition of line of effect and line of sight—two factors key to determining whether a character can use a spell or piece of equipment effectively.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"up67p4C1yL7AsA2G","name":"Area","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":200000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 268</p><p>Some effects cover a defined area. Sometimes an effect’s description indicates a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories discussed below. Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point from which the effect originates, but otherwise you don’t control which creatures or objects are affected. The point of origin of an effect is always a grid intersection, meaning the point where four squares touch on a tactical battle map.</p><p>When determining whether a given creature is within the area of an effect, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares, just as you would do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you must count from intersection to intersection. You can count diagonally across a square, but keep in mind that every second diagonal counts as two squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the effect’s area, everything within that square is within the effect’s area. If the effect’s area touches only the near edge of a square, however, things within that square are unaffected by the effect.</p><h3>Burst, Emanation, Or Spread</h3><p>Most effects with an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the effect’s point of origin and measure its area from that point.</p><h3>Burst</h3><p>A burst effect applies to whatever is in its area when it comes into effect, including creatures that you can’t see. It doesn’t affect creatures with total cover from the burst’s point of origin, and its effects don’t extend around corners. The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst effects are specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst’s area defines how far from the point of origin the effect extends.</p><h3>Emanation</h3><p>An emanation effect functions like a burst, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the effect. Most emanations are cones or spheres.</p><h3>Spread</h3><p>A spread effect extends out like a burst, but it can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the effect spreads out to a given distance in all directions. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can’t see. Calculate distance using the actual distance the effect travels, taking into account turns the effect takes and counting around walls and corners, not through them. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see page 271) to the entirety of the effect’s area.</p><h3>Cone, Cylinder, Line, Or Sphere</h3><p>Most effects with an area have a particular shape.</p><h3>Cone</h3><p>A cone-shaped effect extends away from you in a quartercircle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and grows wider as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won’t go around corners.</p><h3>Cylinder</h3><p>With cylinder-shaped effects, you select the effect’s point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle at a height designated in the effect’s description, and the effect drops down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped effect ignores any obstructions within its area.</p><h3>Line</h3><p>A line-shaped effect extends away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect (see page 271). A line-shaped effect applies to all creatures in squares through which the line passes.</p><h3>Sphere</h3><p>A sphere-shaped effect expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres can be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p><h3>Shapable (S)</h3><p>If an area or effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the effect. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. The “areas” of many effects are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular or three-dimensional shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define areas and effects in space.</p><h3>Other</h3><p>An effect can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p><h3>Areas With Targets</h3><p>Some effects have areas that target creatures or objects within the specified area. Unlike for targeted effects (see Target on page 272), you do not get to select which creatures are affected; the effect affects all creatures or objects of some kind in the specified area.<br /><br />If an effect restricts which targets are affected (for example, it affects only living creatures), then creatures in the effect’s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the number of creatures affected.</p><h3>Subjects Of Effects</h3><p>If an effect targets creatures or objects directly, the result travels with the subjects for the effect’s duration. If an effect targets an area, it stays within that area for its duration; creatures become subject to the effect when they enter the area but are no longer subject to it when they leave.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"Et5Wi1ityPgChozU","name":"Descriptors","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 269</p><p>A descriptor is a term that helps define an item, a spell, or another effect in some way. Some effects have more than one descriptor, each of which further refines the ways the effect works and interacts with the world around it, while others have none. Even equipment sometimes has descriptors.</p><p>The descriptors are as follows: acid, air, calling, chaotic, charm, cold, compulsion, creation, curse, darkness, death, disease, earth, electricity, emotion, evil, fear, fire, force, good, healing, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, pain, poison, radiation, scrying, sense-dependent, shadow, sonic, summoning, teleportation, and water.</p><p>Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves; they instead describe how spells or effects interact with certain other spells or effects. Some descriptors provide additional information about how the effect to which they are attached operates, as defined below.</p><h3>Calling</h3><p>A calling effect transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The effect grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the effect might limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called die if they are killed on the new plane. A called creature can’t be dispelled, even if it was called by magical means.</p><h3>Charm</h3><p>A charm effect changes how the subject views you. This gives you the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to another creature, but its servitude is not absolute or mindless. Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.</p><p>A charmed creature retains its original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that it now regards the person who charmed it as a dear friend and gives great weight to that character’s suggestions and directions. A charmed creature does not volunteer information or tactics that its master doesn’t ask for. A charmed creature never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to it.</p><p>A creature fights friends it had before being charmed only if they threaten its new friend. Even then, it uses the least lethal means at its disposal, for it wishes to resolve the conflict without causing real harm.</p><p>A charmed creature can attempt an opposed Charisma check against its master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make it do something it wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If it succeeds at this check, it decides not to go along with that particular order but remains charmed. If the creature’s master commands it to perform an action that the creature would be vehemently opposed to, it can attempt a new saving throw to break free of its master’s influence altogether.</p><p>If a charmed creature is openly attacked by the character who charmed it or by that character’s apparent allies, it is automatically freed of the spell or effect.</p><h3>Compulsion</h3><p>A compulsion effect overrides the subject’s free will in some way, forcing the subject to act in some manner or changing the way its mind works.</p><h3>Creation</h3><p>A creation effect manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the creator designates. If the effect has a duration other than instantaneous, magic or some other energy holds the creation together, but when the duration ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the effect has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature does not depend on any outside energy for its existence, so it lasts indefinitely once created.</p><h3>Force</h3><p>A force effect deals full damage to incorporeal creatures and blocks their movement. It also blocks the sense through ability.</p><h3>Language-Dependent</h3><p>A language-dependent effect uses intelligible language (either audible, visual, or telepathic) as a medium for communication. If you cannot communicate with the target or the target cannot understand what you are communicating, the effect fails to affect that target.</p><h3>Mind-Affecting</h3><p>A mind-affecting effect works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p><h3>Pain</h3><p>A pain effect causes unpleasant sensations but not permanent physical damage. Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fortitude save are immune to pain effects.</p><h3>Scrying</h3><p>A scrying effect creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information while the effect lasts. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same sensory abilities that you have naturally, but not any sensory abilities you gain from other spells or technology. The sensor is a separate, independent source of sensory input for you, and thus it functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened or otherwise suffer sensory impairment.</p><p>A creature can notice a scrying sensor with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the spell or effect’s level). The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell. Lead sheeting, force fields, and some exotic materials and magical protections block scrying effects; if that is the case, you can sense that the effect has been blocked.</p><h3>Sense-Dependent</h3><p>A sense-dependent effect has either audible or visual elements, requiring sight or hearing to have any effect. For this kind of effect to affect that target, you must be able to either see or hear the target, and the target must be able to either see or hear you.</p><h3>Shadow</h3><p>A shadow effect creates something that is partially real from an amalgamation of extradimensional energy. Damage dealt by a shadow effect is real.</p><h3>Summoning</h3><p>A summoning effect instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the effect ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from (typically another plane, but not always), but a summoned object is not sent back unless the effect description specifically indicates otherwise. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its Hit Points drop to 0, but it is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform in the place from which it was summoned, during which time it can’t be summoned again.</p><p>When a summoning effect ends and the summoned creature disappears, all spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have.</p><h3>Teleportation</h3><p>A teleportation effect involves instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane (see page 471). Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation unless the specific effect notes otherwise, and teleportation effects work within the Drift.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"Ga4KuraN0a6jMoav","name":"Duration","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":400000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 270</p><p>An effect’s duration tells you how long the effect lasts. If a spell, ability, or item has a specific duration and creates one or more effects, those effects last for the duration unless the specific effect notes otherwise.</p><p>Sometimes an effect is suppressed without being negated or dispelled. When this happens, the effect’s duration is unchanged. It still ends at the same time it would have ended if it had not been suppressed.</p><h3>Timed Durations</h3><p>Durations are usually measured in rounds, minutes, hours, days, or other increments. When the time of the effect’s duration is up, the energy or force empowering the effect goes away and the effect ends. If an effect’s duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly by the GM so you don’t know how long the effect will last.</p><p>Whenever an effect’s duration is expressed in a standard unit that measures time, such as hours, days, or even years, it refers to those units as expressed in Pact Standard Time. Under this scheme, a day has 24 hours of 60 minutes each, and a year has 365 days (or 52 weeks). For more information about time and similar concepts in Starfinder, see Time on page 430.</p><h3>Instantaneous</h3><p>The effect comes and goes the instant it is created, though its consequences might last longer.</p><h3>Permanent</h3><p>The effect remains until is undone through some method, such as by dispel magic for permanent spells.</p><h3>Concentration</h3><p>When an effect has a duration of concentration, the effect lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain an effect is a standard action. Any factor that could break your concentration while you are performing activities that require focus (such as casting a spell) can also break your concentration while you’re maintaining an effect, causing the effect to end. See Concentration and Interrupted Spells on page 331 for more details. You can neither use an effect that requires concentration nor cast a spell while concentrating on an effect. Some effects last for a short time after you cease concentrating—typically 1 round per level, though individual effects may vary as noted in their descriptions.</p><h3>Discharge</h3><p>Occasionally an effect lasts for a set duration, or until it is triggered or discharged.</p><h3>Touch Effects And Holding The Charge</h3><p>Some effects, most notably spells, have a range of touch (see Range below) and require an action to activate. In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch effect on the round you create it, you can postpone the discharge of the effect (also known as holding the charge) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round until the effect is discharged. If you make any other attack, activate another ability, or cast a spell during this time, the touch effect dissipates.</p><p>Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can’t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.</p><h3>Dismissible (D)</h3><p>If the duration of a spell or effect ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the effect at will as a standard action. You must be within range of the effect and be able to fulfill the same conditions required to create the effect—such as being able to concentrate to cast a spell or having access to the equipment that created the effect— though you do not actually need to spend the appropriate action. An effect that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the effect is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"XgpxYRh2GsOZnPzp","name":"Line of Effect","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":500000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 271</p><p>If a weapon, spell, ability, or item requires an attack roll and has a range measured in feet, it normally requires that you (or whoever or whatever is using the ability) have a line of effect to the target to be effective (subject to GM discretion). A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what an attack or ability can affect. A line of effect is blocked by a solid barrier that can stop the effect in question (such as a wall, for most effects), but it is not blocked by purely visual restrictions (such as smoke or darkness). You cannot have line of effect that exceeds planetary range, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p>You must have a clear line of effect to any creature or object you wish to target or to any space in which you wish to create an effect without an area. For effects with an area, you must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of the effect. An effect that is a burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation affects only an area, creature, or object within line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst’s center point, a cone-shaped burst’s starting point, the center point of a cylinder’s circle, or an emanation’s point of origin). For definitions of these specific terms, see Area on page 268.</p><p>If you have a line of effect to some of a target’s space but not all of it, the target has cover (see pages 253–254 for more information about cover).

An effect’s range is the maximum distance from you that the effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can designate the effect’s point of origin. If any portion of the effect’s area would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. If a range is based on level, this means caster level for spells, class level for class features, and item level for weapons and equipment. Standard ranges include the following.</p><h3>Personal</h3><p>An effect with a range of personal is limited to and affects your person only.</p><h3>Touch</h3><p>If an effect has a range of touch, you must touch a creature or object to affect your target, which requires you to hit with a melee attack roll (against EAC unless the effect says otherwise) if you are touching an unwilling target. A touch effect that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a weapon can. Some touch effects allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch up to six willing or unconscious targets as part of the activation of such an effect, but all targets of the effect must be touched in the same round that you finish activating the effect. If the effect allows you to touch targets over multiple rounds, touching up to six creatures is a full action.</p><h3>Close</h3><p>An effect with a range of close reaches as far as 25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 levels you have.</p><h3>Medium</h3><p>An effect with a range of medium reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per level you have.</p><h3>Long</h3><p>An effect with a range of long reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per level you have.</p><h3>Planetary</h3><p>An effect with a range of planetary can reach anywhere on the same planet. This also covers targets in orbit around the planet, such as moons and artificial satellites.</p><h3>System-Wide</h3><p>An effect with a range of system-wide can reach anywhere in the same solar system.</p><h3>Plane</h3><p>An effect with a range of plane can reach anywhere in the same plane of existence.</p><h3>Unlimited</h3><p>Some effects, mostly high-level spells, can reach anywhere, even onto other planes. Effects with ranges of unlimited are often very powerful, and they can be difficult or impossible to access until you reach a high level.</p><h3>Range Expressed In Feet</h3><p>Some effects have no standard range category, just a range expressed in feet. In this case, the specific effect lists exactly how far its range extends.</p><h3>Range Increment</h3><p>Some effects, especially weapons, have a range increment.

You use these effects on creatures or objects, as defined by the effect itself. You must have line of effect (see page 271) to the target or targets of an effect you wish to use, and you must specifically choose the target or targets. If the effect takes a certain amount of time to activate (such as the casting time of a spell), you do not have to select your target or targets until you finish activating the effect.</p><p>For example, if you decide to cast a spell that would affect multiple creatures, you need not choose exactly which creatures it affects until you are done casting it and the spell is about to go into effect. This allows you to avoid casting spells or imposing effects on creatures that might have been taken out of a fight or otherwise incapacitated in the interim between your decision to cast a spell and when you’ve finished casting it and it’s ready to take effect.</p><p>Some effects restrict which targets can be selected. If an effect targets living creatures, it affects all creatures other than constructs and undead—in other words, biological or technobiological creatures that are alive. (Artificially created beings that are not undead or constructs are considered living for this purpose.) If an effect targets willing or unconscious targets, it affects only those creatures who wish to be affected by it. A creature can declare itself a willing target at any time (even if it’s flat-footed or it isn’t that creature’s turn); this does not use up an action and simply requires, for example, a player to inform another player that his character is a willing target. Other effects allow you to target other categories of creatures or items, such as effects that can specifically target a construct, corpse, or object.</p><p>Some effects allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you activate it.

The persona’s simply a bundle of code through which you act, though you can give it a sensory signature that others perceive when interacting with it. However, your persona is also a target through which others can attack you, track your location, and expel you from the digital space.</p><p><strong>Persona Health:</strong> Countermeasures might attack your persona, degrading its performance or even using the persona to attack you and your equipment more directly. Your persona’s overall health is measured by Connection Points (CP), with lost CP representing damage that impairs performance and connectivity.

Once they begin, the hackers typically work against a timer, as most countermeasures have countdowns that represent how quickly they react to intruders. The encounter continues so long as at least one hacker accesses the computer; however, a GM might end the encounter once a hacker has secured root access or resolved all countermeasures, either of which ends the encounter’s remaining threat.</p><h2>Hacking Phases</h2><p>Much like physical combat, dynamic hacking takes place in phases, during which hackers and automated defenses take turns acting within a digital space. The hackers always act first in a phase, after which the computer’s defenses resolve any of their effects. Each phase, hackers can perform an assortment of actions, including major actions that cause substantial effects and minor actions that focus more on observation, commands, and support. Any lead hacker can perform one major action and one minor action per turn, whereas a support hacker can perform only a minor action per turn.</p><p><strong>Bonus Actions:</strong> At the start of their turn, a hacker can choose to perform additional actions. A lead hacker can choose to take up to three additional major actions during their turn, but they take a cumulative –5 penalty to all skill checks they attempt during their turn for each additional major action taken. A support hacker can choose to take a major action instead of a minor action by spending 1 Resolve Point.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"4zJxyTI39H8H6K5H","name":"Hacking Objectives","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":500000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>TR pg. 71</p><p>Objectives represent a combination of goals and obstacles that a hacker overcomes during a hacking encounter. An encounter typically begins with several objectives, and additional objectives appear over the course of the encounter. These objectives are divided into three categories based on their lead function, and sample objectives appear on page 73.</p><p><strong>Countermeasures:</strong> These objectives represent deliberate defenses that pose some risk to hackers. They range from alarms and contingent computer viruses to live counterhackers attempting to stymie intruders.</p><p><strong>Modules:</strong> These objectives are programs that typically have value to the hackers—and are usually the reason for hacking in the first place—such as command modules that control doors or data modules that contain valuable intelligence.</p><p><strong>Nodes:</strong> These objectives are figurative branches within the computer that provide access to other objectives beyond. Reaching modules often requires traversing one or more nodes.</p><h3>Objective Statistics</h3><p>Objectives typically include a name, a description, and the following.</p><p><strong>Check DC:</strong> This is the base DC of skill checks for interacting with this obstacle. An obstacle’s check DC equals either 15 + 1-1/2 × the encounter’s CR or 15 + 3 × the computer’s tier. Specific checks and actions often include modifiers that adjust this value.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> This lists the way or ways a hacker might overcome the objective. A Resolve entry lists the checks required, the number of successes required for each check, and any modifier to the base DC for those checks. For example, an obstacle with a Check DC of 18 that lists Hack (DC + 0, 2 successes) and Process (DC – 2, 1 success) as its Resolve entry requires two successful DC 18 Hack checks and one successful DC 16 Process check to overcome.</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> This lists any alternate skills a hacker can use when performing the aid action to assist another hacker in overcoming the obstacle.</p><p><strong>Countdown:</strong> This is a timer that triggers special conditions after a certain number of phases, listed in parentheses; some obstacles’ Countdowns are rolled randomly when the obstacle appears. At the end of each hacking phase, reduce this number by 1. If the number is ever reduced to 0, the listed effect occurs.</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> This is any special effect that happens once the objective has been resolved.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> This is any additional effect the obstacle creates.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"33GEFTJK1fM6vIkp","name":"Hacking Actions","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":600000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source</strong> TR pg. 72</p><p>The following are common actions used in dynamic hacking encounters. At the GM’s discretion, a hacker might be able to perform actions other than these.</p><h2>Aid (Minor)</h2><p>You run programs, review diagnostics, or look for weaknesses that help your lead hacker with an upcoming task.</p><p><strong>Check: </strong>Choose one action that a lead hacker will attempt this phase. Attempt the same check, but the DC of your check instead equals 10 or the obstacle’s base DC – 10, whichever is higher. If the obstacle lists additional skills in its Support entry, you can attempt a check with one of those skills in place of the skill typically used for the action.</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> The lead hacker gains a +2 bonus to their check to perform that action if they do so before the end of the phase. The bonus increases to +3 if you exceed the DC by 5–9, and increases to +4 if you exceed the DC by 10 or more. A lead hacker can’t gain more than a +4 bonus to any one check from the aid action, even if aided by multiple allies.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can’t use this action to grant a bonus to one of your own actions.</p><h2>Assess (Minor)</h2><p>You study an obstacle to understand its features.</p><p><strong>Check:</strong> Process + 0</p><p><strong>Success: </strong>You learn the Resolve, Support, Countdown (including the current countdown value), Success, and Special entries for the obstacle. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to resolve the obstacle for 3 phases. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you also identify whether the obstacle has any hidden countermeasures, such as a data bomb or fake shell.</p><h2>Blend (Major)</h2><p>You camouflage your persona and conceal signs of your activity.</p><p><strong>Check: </strong>Deceive + 0</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> You increase the countdown of all objectives by 1. If you exceed the check’s DC by 5 or more, you can choose one objective and instead increase its countdown by 1d3.</p><h2>Decoy (Major)</h2><p>You create a fake persona that confounds countermeasures.</p><p><strong>Check:</strong> Deceive + 0</p><p><strong>Success: </strong>You create a convincing decoy that lasts until the end of the encounter. When a countermeasure would affect your persona, it has an equal chance of affecting your persona or one of your decoys (such as a 1 in 3 chance of affecting your persona if you have two decoys). Once a countermeasure affects a decoy, that decoy is destroyed with no effect. Countermeasures that do not target a persona (such as wipe) ignore decoys.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> Each time you successfully create a decoy, the DC to create additional decoys increases by 4.</p><h2>Modify (Major)</h2><p>You change a vulnerable program’s functions. This action has a wide range of applications, from deleting a program or changing a module’s data to building or installing a contingent virus.</p><p><strong>Check:</strong> The check varies by the task, determined by the GM. Destroying or destabilizing programs typically requires a Hack check, whereas forging data or installing a backdoor typically requires a Deceive check. Simple tasks might reduce the DC by up to 5, whereas very complicated tasks might increase the DC by up to 5. Some tasks are so vast in scope that they require hours or more—beyond the scope of most hacking encounters.</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> You successfully perform the action.</p><h2>Recalibrate (Major)</h2><p>You adjust your persona’s subskills for new tasks.</p><p><strong>Check:</strong> Process – 2</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> Reassign the circumstance modifiers you applied when configuring your persona at the beginning of the encounter, setting each modifier between –3 and +3 so long as their sum does not exceed the value allowed by your computer or number of Computers ranks (page 70).</p><h2>Repair (Major)</h2><p>You restore damage sustained by your persona or that of an ally.</p><p><strong>Check: </strong>Process – 5</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> You restore a number of the persona’s lost CP equal to 1d6 + half your ranks in Computers, Engineering, or Medicine (whichever is highest).

Each encounter includes at least one objective tied to the hacker’s goal (such as secret data to steal or a door to open), at least one countermeasure that opposes the hacker, and often, one or more nodes that create avenues the hackers must navigate toward their goals.</p><p>To build an encounter, set the encounter’s Challenge Rating— which sets the encounter’s check DC (page 71)—and decide on an approximate encounter length based on the number of checks required to resolve the key objectives. A short encounter requires about 5–7 successful checks to resolve the main objectives, whereas longer encounters might require 10–15 checks. For each lead hacker involved, add enough countermeasures to increase the number of checks by 2 (for shorter encounters) or by as much as 4 for longer encounters. For each support hacker, increase the number of checks by 1.</p><p>Scaling an encounter in this way need not always involve adding more countermeasures but could instead involve requiring an additional success to resolve specific objectives. This way, even if more PCs join the encounter as lead hackers than you anticipated, you can easily adjust the encounter to provide a fairly similar challenge.</p><p><strong>Timed Encounters:</strong> In Starfinder, successfully accessing a system often affords the hacker time to explore at leisure. While a dynamic hack attempt might include finite countermeasures and a clear win condition, the format also supports hackers clashing with an array of defenses that multiply faster than the PCs can deactivate them. In this case, the goal becomes resolving enough countermeasures to stay safe, accomplish the mission, and escape before being overwhelmed or detected.</p><h2>Sample Objectives</h2><p>The following are common objectives, including adaptations of existing modules and countermeasures from the Core Rulebook.</p><h3><strong>Basic Counterhacker (Countermeasure)</strong></h3><p>This capable programmer shores up the computer’s defenses.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Deceive (DC + 0, 2 successes) or Hack (DC + 2, 2 successes)<br />Countdown (3): Whenever the countdown reaches 0, the counterhacker causes two effects. First, they damage the persona of one lead hacker, causing it to lose CP equal to 2d6 + the encounter’s CR. That lead hacker can halve the CP their persona lost by succeeding at a DC + 0 Process check. Second, the counterhacker can perform one of the actions below. Afterward, roll 1d3 to determine the obstacle’s new countdown value.</p><p><strong>Attack:</strong> Increase the Process check DC to resist the damage by 2, and treat all 1s on the damage dice as 2s.</p><p><strong>Infect:</strong> The counterhacker infects the persona with a virus. Each phase after the hackers act, the infected persona loses CP equal to 1d6 plus half the encounter’s CR, and any computer that persona’s hacker is using takes damage equal to twice the CP lost. The virus can be removed by spending a major action and succeeding at a DC + 0 Hack check.</p><p><strong>Repair:</strong> Choose one obstacle that hasn’t been resolved. Treat one of the checks to resolve that obstacle as though it had not been fulfilled this encounter.<br />Trace: The counterhacker assesses the persona’s signature and identifies where its associated hacker is located unless that hacker succeeds at a DC + 0 Deceive check.</p><h3><strong>Node, Basic (Node)</strong></h3><p>The collection of file paths requires some effort to navigate and secure permission to restricted areas beyond.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Hack (DC – 2, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success)</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> Perception</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> Add the node’s linked obstacles to the encounter.</p><h3><strong>Node, Fake Shell (Node)</strong></h3><p>This node misleads hackers toward a falsified set of files.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Hack (DC – 2, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success)</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> Perception</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> Add the node’s linked obstacles to the encounter.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> If the Process check to resolve this obstacle doesn’t exceed the DC by 5 or more, the linked obstacles are convincing fakes that function as normal obstacles, but resolving them provides no benefit (e.g. seemingly valuable data is worthless, command modules can’t direct devices, etc.).</p><h3><strong>Root Access (Module)</strong></h3><p>You secure absolute administrator privileges, allowing you to modify any of the computer’s functions with ease.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Hack (DC + 20, 1 success), Hack (DC + 15, 1 success), Deceive (DC + 10, 1 success)</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> You and allied hackers reduce DCs to resolve obstacles by 20 and automatically succeed at checks to analyze objectives.</p><h3><strong>Secure Data (Module)</strong></h3><p>This is an average-security data module with valuable contents. Large secure data modules typically require additional checks to resolve, have higher check DCs, or both.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Hack (DC + 0, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success)</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> Profession check related to the data</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> Hackers can now use the modify action accompanied by specific subskill checks to delete (Hack), modify (Hack), forge (Deceive), or copy (Process) the module’s contents. As a special minor action, a hacker can study the contents with a successful DC + 0 Process check or related skill check to seek specific info or attain a basic understanding of the module’s contents.</p><h3><strong>Wipe (Countermeasure)</strong></h3><p>This program destroys important data.</p><p><strong>Resolve:</strong> Deceive (DC + 0, 1 success), Hack (DC + 0, 1 success)</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> Count the number of times hackers fail a check to resolve an obstacle while the wipe countermeasure is active. Once the count reaches 2 failures, this countermeasure begins erasing one or more other objectives, imposing a –5 penalty to resolve them. At the end of the next hacking phase, those objectives are removed from the encounter and can no longer be resolved.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"bnSSwuktNFJhmWFL","name":"Adapting Hacking Abilities","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":800000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>TR pg. 72</p><p>The following are guidelines for adapting existing class features and character options to the dynamic hacking system.</p><p><strong>Faster Hacking:</strong> An ability that reduces the time it takes to hack instead reduces the penalty a lead hacker takes when performing additional major actions to –3 per additional action.</p><p><strong>Delay Countermeasures:</strong> An ability that would delay a countermeasure’s activation instead increases that countermeasure’s starting countdown value by 1.</p><p><strong>Negate Countermeasures:</strong> Abilities that would negate a countermeasure entirely instead grant that character a +10 bonus to their first check to resolve the countermeasure.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> Features that increase the check DC to hack your own computer instead apply their bonus to your checks made to resist any effect that would harm your computer or persona.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

The table includes pricing for individual types of these items, and they all have negligible bulk. The rules for how drugs and poisons can affect a character can be found in Afflictions (see page 414).</p><h2>Drugs</h2><p>Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an<br />injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.</p><h2>Medicinals</h2><p>Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as medicinals, this entry refers specifically to substances primarily used to treat ailments and which lack addictive properties. However, many medicinals can also be used to help incapacitate a target or capture one largely unharmed. Medicinals can be delivered in the same way as drugs, including via a successful attack with a weapon with the injection weapon special property.</p><p>The three most common categories of medicinals are described below. Regardless of a medicinal’s effects, its price is tied to its tier, as shown on Table 7–34: Drugs, Medicinals, and Poisons.</p><h3>Analgesic</h3><p>An analgesic deadens sensory input and is used by medical professionals to reduce sensations of pain. If you take or are injected with an analgesic, you are flat-footed for 1 round per tier of the medicinal. You also gain a bonus (equal to the analgesic’s tier) to saving throws against pain effects for 10 minutes per tier of the medicinal.</p><h3>Antitoxin</h3><p>An antitoxin is a broad-spectrum medicinal designed to weaken all poisons in your system. When you take or are injected with an antitoxin, you gain a bonus (equal to 3 + the medicinal’s tier) to saving throws against poison for a number of hours equal to its tier.</p><h3>Sedative</h3><p>Numerous mild sedatives commonly available for purchase have legitimate medical uses, but they are also popular among some bounty hunters to help capture their quarries alive. If you take or are injected with a sedative, you take nonlethal damage. A tier 1 sedative deals 1d4 nonlethal damage, a tier 2 sedative deals 2d4 nonlethal damage, a tier 3 sedative deals 4d4 nonlethal damage, and a tier 4 sedative deals 8d4 nonlethal damage. When suffering from an emotion or fear effect that allows a saving throw to negate it, you can take or be injected with a sedative that permits you to immediately attempt a new saving throw with a bonus equal to the sedative’s tier to end the effect, as long as it’s not a permanent or instantaneous effect.</p><h2>Poisons</h2><p>Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of injury poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand. For more information on poisons, including their effects and how they work, see Afflictions on page 414.</p><h2>Table 7–34: Drugs, Medicinals, and Poisons</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>SUBSTANCE</td><td>LEVEL</td><td>PRICE</td><td>DOSE</td></tr><tr><td>DRUGS</td><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Hyperleaf</td><td>1</td><td>95</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dreamshiver</td><td>5</td><td>2,500</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Transdimensional pesh</td><td>10</td><td>14,000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Megaopiate</td><td>12</td><td>22,000</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>MEDICINALS</td><td>LEVEL</td><td>PRICE</td><td>DOSE</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1</td><td>1</td><td>75</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 2</td><td>5</td><td>450</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3</td><td>10</td><td>2,700</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4</td><td>15</td><td>16,200</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td>POISONS</td><td>LEVEL</td><td>PRICE</td><td>DOSE</td></tr><tr><td>Id moss</td><td>2</td><td>140</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Insanity mist</td><td>4</td><td>350</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Blue whinnis</td><td>7</td><td>1,000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Green lotus extract</td><td>8</td><td>1,500</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ungol dust</td><td>9</td><td>2,000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow essence</td><td>10</td><td>2,650</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Deathblade</td><td>16</td><td>24,000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Black lotus extract</td><td>20</td><td>121,000</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"dD3KuLXvOyIxe8YD","name":"Trade Goods","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":200000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 232</p><p>The trade goods found on Table 7–35: Trade Goods are described below. Trade goods can normally be sold for their full value, subject to the GM’s discretion. These are given only as common baselines, most applicable to the Pact Worlds, as regional variances can have a significant impact on the value of trade goods.</p><h2>Fine Art</h2><p>Fine art can be nearly anything, though as trade goods those items with a set, singular, physical existence (paintings, sculpture, and so on) are more easily bought and sold than performance art (though, for example, the sole copy of a famous vesk play could be valuable until broadly disseminated). Fine art can be of nearly any price or bulk, as determined by the GM.</p><h2>Gems</h2><p>Gems are valued for their scarcity, their beauty, and, in some cases, their utility for some forms of magic rituals and technology. The value of a gemstone is determined by many factors, including size, rarity, clarity, cut, polish, and potential cultural influences. Gems considered of low quality are usually priced at 5–45 credits. Gems rated as semiprecious are generally priced at 50–95 credits. Gems rated as precious are generally priced at 150–450 credits, and those rated as jewels are generally priced at 1,000–4,500 credits. Gems rated as grand jewels are priced no lower than 5,000 credits, and the rarest and most valued can be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of credits.</p><h2>Grain</h2><p>Grain is a common staple and can be considered representative of a wide range of basic foods. Of course, grain prices vary wildly, but the price given here is a baseline for a typical grain, packaged and shipped in bulk amounts.</p><h2>Textiles</h2><p>Common textiles include good linen and most synthetic fabrics. Fine textiles are of higher quality, with more visual appeal, higher durability, or both. Various silks, satins, and similar cloths are typical fine textiles, though more exotic materials exist in this category. Truly luxurious fabrics, including marramas and samite, can easily cost much more than even the best fine fabrics.</p><h2>UPB</h2><p>A universal polymer base, or UPB, is the basis for most technology in the Pact Worlds, the Veskarium, and many other systems. Each UPB is a tiny multifunction component, not much larger than a grain of rice, capable of being configured to act as a brace, capacitor, circuit, diode, fastener, insulator, lens, modulator, pipe, resistor, and dozens of other constituent parts. UPBs can even be spun out into fabric, broken down into component chemicals, reconstituted into new chemicals, or supplemented with base materials (such as dirt or sand) to form massive braces or walls. The right combination of hundreds or even thousands of UPBs can create everything from a comm unit to a laser weapon to powered armor. In their raw form, UPBs have a bulk of 1 per 1,000 UPBs, though when aligned and configured they can easily take up less bulk, and when configured for a specific purpose that calls for a minimum size and bracing (possibly combining them with inert materials), they can have a higher bulk.</p><p>UPBs are so ubiquitous that they are usable as currency in many major settlements and trade hubs. While credsticks are a more convenient and secure way to carry value, UPBs have the advantage of direct utility and untraceability. They are a popular way to pay smugglers and criminals, but they are also useful for trade missions to systems with UPB technology that don’t use credits as currency. The value of the Pact Worlds’ credit is based on the economic utility of a single UPB.</p><h2>Table 7–35: Trade Goods</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>ITEM</td><td>PRICE</td><td>BULK</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.mQ7n1yibCtY0QJHG]{Fine art}</td><td>Varies</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.DlhLioGmU0J2x2rE]{Gem}</td><td>Varies</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.nS2c4lZiu2BX8Xyr]{Grain}</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.jP7JYkz9KacczDhu]{Textiles, common}</td><td>1</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.qqLIJsu5ETlGoI51]{Textiles, fine}</td><td>100</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.hRkH7VhJnaB8yF99]{UPB (1000)}</td><td>1000</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br /></p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"97XdbqkYsAFvYwXT","name":"Other Purchases","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":0,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 230</p><p>Beyond weapons, armor, and crucial technological, magical, and hybrid equipment, explorers and adventurers need food, clothing, survival supplies, and other basic gear.

Efforts to hire criminals, mercenaries, or businesses fall under the purview of the GM, though unskilled laborers can be hired relatively cheaply (see Table 7–38).</p><h3>Communications</h3><p>Those without access to a starship’s comms system can send and receive messages at system-wide or unlimited range (see page 272) by paying an individual or business. System-wide communications cost 5 credits per minute, and unlimited-range communications cost 10 credits per minute.</p><h3>Professional Freelancer</h3><p>Entertainers, experts, porters, and tradesfolk often lack time or interest in taking jobs outside of their normal work. Those who do are freelancers, who build a circle of regular clients and get paid directly by those to whom they provide services. The price of hiring a freelancer is based on the typical total bonus she has in a specific relevant skill (often Profession), representing her skill level. However, the GM can determine a specific freelancer actually has a bonus much higher or lower than the norm for someone at her pay rate. Even professional freelancers won’t generally take work that places them in serious danger, and those few who do are likely to insist on pay rates two to 10 times higher than those listed.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Professional spellcasters are common only in major settlements and often require advance appointments and insist on security measures when dealing with new clients. Many are associated with a church, guild, or major corporation, and they may only work for groups and individuals associated with such organizations. It’s generally not possible to convince a professional spellcaster to travel to an unsecured location to cast spells, and any who do agree to it will insist on much higher payment rates (anywhere from 10 to 100 times the normal price).</p><p>If a spell requires an expenditure of credits, add that price to the price of having a professional spellcaster cast it. If a spell requires an expenditure of Resolve Points to be cast, increase the price of having it performed by a professional spellcaster by 50%; most professional spellcasters will only cast one such spell each day.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a spell requires an expenditure of credits, add that price to the price of having a professional spellcaster cast it.

Examples of standard grooming services include haircuts, fur trimming, feather preening, claw or nail trimming, nail and scale buffing, parasite removal, tooth cleaning and dentistry, and the like. Exotic grooming services are usually considered luxuries rather than necessities, and include hair, fur, or scale coloring; body modifications; permanent and temporary tattoos; and wellness services such as massages, medicinal baths, and spa treatments.</span></p><h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Laundry</span></h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Standard laundry services include both washing and drycleaning, and the listed price is for up to 1 bulk of clothing. Clean laundry is usually ready the next day. Magical laundry service is usually provided by a spellcaster using </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">token spell </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">to instantly clean up to one outfit or 10 items at once.</span></p><h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Medical Treatment</span></h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">While technological medical equipment and magical healing are readily available for purchase in most areas, many people have neither the funds nor the skill to use such methods. Fortunately, three types of facilities provide medical treatment services to the general public: clinics, hospitals, and trauma centers. Each of these facilities is usually equipped with multiple medical labs (</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Core Rulebook </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">220) and can perform some or all of the tasks of the Medicine skill (</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Core Rulebook </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">143), detailed below. Prices depend on the service provided, as listed in Table 1–34, though most facilities will perform first aid for no cost. These are average prices; medical treatments at a high-end or luxury facility can cost 2 to 10 times more.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Clinics are small outpatient facilities that provide only basic medical treatments: first aid, treat deadly wounds, treat disease, and treat drugs or poison. Hospitals are larger institutions that offer all medical treatments and include room and board for the duration of your stay. Trauma centers provide emergency care for traumatic injuries and can offer the following medical treatments: first aid, treat deadly wounds, long-term stability, and treat drugs or poison.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">An average doctor at a clinic is a CR 6 expert with Life Science and Medicine as master skills (+16 skill bonus for both), while a typical doctor at a hospital or trauma center is a CR 7 expert with a +19 skill bonus in Life Science and Medicine.</span></p><h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starship Crew</span></h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Although most starships require crews of only half a dozen or fewer to fly, larger vessels can require 20 or more crew members to operate successfully. Standard crew members usually don’t have a stat block, but they are generally characters of CR 1 or lower. They cannot fill roles in starship combat, but they can serve on teams supporting an officer in a role.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Officers are NPCs who can be hired to fill unoccupied starship combat roles on a starship. Officer stat blocks can be created using the monster creation rules beginning on page 126 of the </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Alien Archive</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">, with the skill most associated with their starship role as a master skill. They can be any CR, but few officers will serve on a starship of a lower tier than their CR. Officers can have any class graft, but it’s generally easier to find envoys, mechanics, operatives, and soldiers interested in serving aboard starships than mystics, solarians, or technomancers.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">The price of hiring a starship officer is based on the typical total bonus she has in a specific skill relevant to her starship role, representing her skill level. However, the GM can determine that a specific officer actually has a bonus much higher or lower than the norm for someone at her pay rate. At the GM’s discretion, NPCs that the PCs have helped or allied with can choose to become crew members on the PCs’ starship, possibly reducing the price to hire them by half, one-third, or even to zero for exceptionally grateful NPCs.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Recharging Stations</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Most settlements of any significant size have public recharging stations for batteries and power cells. To recharge the full capacity of a spent battery or power cell takes 1 round per charge and costs half the price of the battery or cell. You can recharge a partially depleted battery or cell, but the price for doing so is the same as if it were fully spent. At the GM’s discretion, some larger starships might have onboard recharging stations. These might offer recharging at low or no cost, but they typical</span></p><h2>Table 7–37: Lodgings</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Price</th></tr><tr><td> Efficiency</td><td> 3 per night</td></tr><tr><td> Sleep Pod</td><td> 1 per night</td></tr><tr><td> Suite, 1-2 Beds</td><td> 5 per night per bed</td></tr><tr><td> Suite, 3-4 Beds</td><td> 10 per night per bed</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Table: Professional Services</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Level</th><th>Price</th></tr><tr><td> Communications</td><td> 0</td><td> 5 or 10 per minute</td></tr><tr><td> Professional Freelancer</td><td> 0</td><td> Skill Bonus x 2 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Unskilled Labor</td><td> 0</td><td> 4 per day or 1 per hour</td></tr><tr><td> Grooming, Exotic</td><td> 0</td><td> 75</td></tr><tr><td> Grooming, Standard</td><td> 0</td><td> 3</td></tr><tr><td> Laundry, Magical</td><td> 0</td><td> 10</td></tr><tr><td> Laundry, Standard</td><td> 0</td><td> 1</td></tr><tr><td> Medical Treatment, Long-Term Care</td><td> 0</td><td> 100 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Medical Treatment, Long-Term Stability</td><td> 0</td><td> 15 per hour</td></tr><tr><td> Medical Treatment, Treat Deadly Wounds</td><td> 0</td><td> 75</td></tr><tr><td> Medical Treatment, Treat Disease</td><td> 0</td><td> 1,000</td></tr><tr><td> Medical Treatment, Treat Drugs or Poison</td><td> 0</td><td> 1,000</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 0-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 20</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 1st-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 100</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 2nd-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 350</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 3rd-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 1,000</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 4th-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 3,000</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 5th-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td> 9,000</td></tr><tr><td> Spellcasting, 6th-level Spell</td><td> 0</td><td>  30,000</td></tr><tr><td> Starship Crew, Officer</td><td> 0</td><td> Skill bonus x 5 per week</td></tr><tr><td> Starship Crew, Standard</td><td> 0</td><td> 20 per week</td></tr><tr><td> Union Membership, Apprentice</td><td> 1</td><td> 5 credits/month</td></tr><tr><td> Union Membership, Artisan</td><td> 7</td><td> 25 credits/month</td></tr><tr><td> Union Membership, Master</td><td> 14</td><td> 100 credits/month</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Table 7–39: Recharging Stations</h2></div><table><tbody><tr><td>TIME</td><td>PRICE</td></tr><tr><td>1 round/charge</td><td>1/2 price of battery or cell</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"yQuhLiaRoYSs5thV","name":"Personal Items","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":50000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 230</p><p>The following personal items are readily available in most places that sell gear. Prices for each item listed below are found in Table 7–33: Personal Items.</p><h2>Backpack (Consumer, Industrial)</h2><p>Backpacks have numerous pockets for storing items that you might need while adventuring and include industrial-strength straps for attaching additional items for easy access. Padded bands strap across the wearer’s chest and waist to evenly distribute the backpack’s weight, and it can carry roughly 2 bulk of items. When fitted properly and worn, the bulk of the backpack itself does not count against your bulk carried (though it does if you carry it in your hands), but the bulk of any items within it does.</p><h3>Consumer</h3><p>When wearing a properly fitted consumer backpack, you treat your Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity.</p><h3>Industrial</h3><p>When wearing a properly fitted industrial backpack, you treat your Strength score as 2 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity. This does not stack with the effect of a consumer backpack.</p><h2>Bonding Epoxy</h2><p>Bonding epoxy is a two-part adhesive plastic kept in a handheld dispenser that automatically mixes the components as they are dispensed. A single dispenser can be used five times. The dispensers cannot be reloaded, and a new dispenser must be purchased if additional epoxy is desired.</p><p>As a full action you can coat up to a 1-square-foot area with the epoxy. Anything held against the area bonds to it over 1d4 rounds as the epoxy dries. This requires a full action each round to maintain contact between the objects, and anything resisting (such as a creature) must be pinned or helpless to be held in place during this drying period. Dispensed epoxy that is not used within 1 minute hardens and loses its ability to bond objects together.</p><p>Pulling apart objects bonded together with this epoxy requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. If the objects are carefully fitted together (requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Engineering check), the Strength DC to separate them increases to 25.</p><h2>Clothing (Environmental, Everyday, Formal, Professional, Travel)</h2><p>Clothing is mass produced throughout the Pact Worlds, and the residents of the system are never wanting for clothes. Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p><h3>Environmental</h3><p>Each environmental outfit is designed with a specific climate in mind, and wearing such an outfit in an extreme environmental condition it is tailored for grants a benefit as follows: cold climates (+2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers), dust storms (reduce damage from dust storms with windstorm-magnitude winds by 1), extreme gravity (reduce damage from extreme gravity environments by 1), heat climates (+2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental heat dangers), radiation (+1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against radiation effects), and zero gravity (+2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics or Athletics checks to stop movement or climb along handholds in zero-g). See Chapter 11 for more information on environmental dangers. The benefit of an environmental outfit can be added to another type of clothing (including a different environmental outfit) by doubling and adding together the price of both types of clothing.</p><h3>Everyday</h3><p>Clothes designed for everyday wear come in a dazzling array of colors and styles, many of which are tailored to specific cultures or planets. Most characters choose their everyday wear based on their personal preferences.</p><h3>Formal</h3><p>Formal wear is designed for a specific social function, such as a wedding or funeral, and commonly differs from planet to planet and even from culture to culture. Lacking the proper formal wear at a social event can cause you to take a penalty of up to –4 to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks at the function, as determined by the GM.</p><h3>Professional</h3><p>Each set of professional wear is tailored to the tasks of a specific Profession skill and accommodates the needs of its wearer while also conveying an air of expertise and professionalism. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Profession checks to earn a living while wearing an appropriate professional outfit.</p><h3>Travel</h3><p>A travel outfit offers additional comfort and support during overland travel. You add 2 miles per 8-hour day of overland movement while wearing a traveling outfit. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks to avoid taking nonlethal damage resulting from a forced march. See Overland Movement on page 258 for more details.</p><h2>Gear Clamp</h2><p>A gear clamp is designed to place a piece of equipment into an easily accessible position. This is often on a belt or the exterior of a suit of armor, but it can also place equipment in convenient locations when you are lurking in a tree or working in a zero-g environment. Affixing a gear clamp in place is a full action, but any object easily and conveniently held in one hand can be added to or removed from a gear clamp as easily as drawing or sheathing a weapon. Gear clamps are designed to have a trick release, with thousands of models each using a unique combination of clicks, spins, tugs, and twists to release attached gear. If you are not familiar with a specific clamps trick (by reading the instructions when you buy the clamp, having it demonstrated, or owning it and periodically testing its function), adding or removing equipment takes a full action. A successful DC 25 Strength check is required to separate material attached by a clamp.</p><h2>Hygiene Kit</h2><p>This kit contains all of the tools and products needed to practice good grooming and hygiene. Kits designed for specific races include supplies (such as scale-care products for vesk or antennae grooming for lashuntas or shirrens) that are of less use to other creatures.</p><h2>Space Suit</h2><p>Although this high-tech suit offers little protection against attack, it does provide all the same environmental protections as a suit of armor (see page 196). Unlike armor, a space suit is not designed for the rigors of combat. Whenever you take damage while wearing a space suit, you must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC equal to the damage dealt) or the space suit’s life systems suffer catastrophic failure, gaining the broken condition and losing all environmental protections in 1d6 hours unless the suit is repaired. If you fail such a saving throw while the suit already has the broken condition, you lose all environmental protections in 1d6 minutes unless the suit is repaired. You can’t wear a space suit while also wearing any type of armor, even if that armor is broken.</p><h2>Tent (Mass Produced, Mobile Hotelier)</h2><p>Tents are designed to protect their occupants from the ravages of the elements. A standard tent has an occupancy of two people. You can double the occupancy of a tent by doubling its price, triple it by tripling its price, and so on.</p><h3>Mass Produced</h3><p>A mass-produced tent is insulated, sturdy, and capable of ventilating to prevent overheating or stuffiness without sacrificing protection. It allows characters within to treat extreme cold weather as severe cold weather, treat severe cold weather as typical cold weather, and ignore the effects of typical cold weather. It adjusts the severity of hot weather in a similar fashion. See page 400 for more information on cold dangers and page 402 for more information on heat dangers. A mass-produced tent does not protect against smoke, catching on fire, lava, radiation, or other environmental hazards.</p><h3>Mobile Hotelier</h3><p>Tents known as mobile hoteliers are advanced and include systems that provide their occupants the same environmental protections as armor (see page 196) while active. A mobile hotelier requires a 20-charge battery to provide this protection, uses 1 charge every 8 hours, and is considered a technological item for effects and abilities that target or disable technology. Even if this protection is removed, the tent can still be used as a mass-produced tent.</p><h2>TABLE 7–33: PERSONAL ITEMS</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>ITEM</td><td>LEVEL</td><td>PRICE</td><td>BULK</td></tr><tr><td>BACKPACK</td><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.dcv9AivhC4IRGMp4]{Consumer}</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.7ZkTZj58lPFE8bZ7]{Industrial}</td><td>1</td><td>25</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CLOTHING</td><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.BUKPrUKmcnckTJEW]{Environmental}</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.vv3Uw4rufnkbDhhi]{Everyday}</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.ozUIux1kwjBz9fwz]{Formal}</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.k4uhCOLBmuO1nxQy]{Professional}</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.RixS54YHX2X2lcyt]{Travel}</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>TENT</td><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.zOvF12YES7pyom6I]{Mass produced}</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.XOQLBRv2pYoV1e57]{Mobile hotelier}</td><td>1</td><td>50</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OTHER</td><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.62ff45eQdRwIE4cK]{Bonding epoxy}</td><td>1</td><td>400</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Xe6dS7O0FWMfUr1x]{Gear clamp}</td><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.qgY6jRuXMLKQKZRn]{Hygiene kit}</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.KF7ltBV698hPOQz8]{Space suit}</td><td>1</td><td>25</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"3HEG3Fq5UGxjkVyw","name":"Food and Drink","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":250000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 233, AR pg. 135</p><p>The food and drinks found on Table 7–36: Food and Drinks are described below. A surprisingly wide range of creatures, including all the Starfinder core races, can survive on the same basic nutritional ingredients. In the Pact Worlds, most food is mass produced; even most restaurant meals are prepared from precut and premeasured ingredients.</p><h2>Field Rations</h2><p>A field ration is prepackaged food that can easily sustain you but lacks flavor and visual appeal. Field rations generally consist of chewy, brownish blocks of processed nutrients, which contain enough moisture to provide a day’s worth of water intake. While it is possible to survive for weeks on nothing but field rations, it’s not a pleasant experience.</p><h2>Intoxicant (Minor, Superior)</h2><p>Table 7–36: Food and Drinks shows the price and bulk of a single serving of an intoxicating beverage or inhaled substance, which in the Pact Worlds is most often alcohol or tobacco. An intoxicant’s potency can be minor or superior. A minor intoxicant might be beer or wine, which takes a few servings to cause any physiological effects. A superior intoxicant is usually a strong spirit, such as whiskey, that can start producing effects after a single serving. Unlike drugs, intoxicants are usually not addictive, although a GM might rule that a PC who partakes of too much of an intoxicant on a regular basis might begin to suffer the effects of an addictive drug (as described in Afflictions on page 417).</p><h2>Meal (Poor, Common, Good)</h2><p>A meal is usually purchased close to the time it is consumed, often at a restaurant or from a street vendor. Most such meals are mass produced in the Pact Worlds, and it is relatively cheap and easy to get food in just about any remotely civilized area. Poor-quality meals are either nutritious but bland, or tasty but unhealthy. Common-quality meals are both tasty and nourishing. Good meals are gourmet in taste and offer higherquality nutrition.</p><h2>R2E</h2><p>These self-contained “Ready-to-Eat” pouches contain a day’s worth of nourishing entrees and side dishes, plus a portable snack or dessert. Each R2E also includes disposable utensils, a single-use flameless ration heater, and an accessory pack containing breath freshener, a disposable cup, a napkin, seasonings, and drink powder. Each R2E has a shelf life of one century, and the pouch is made of a durable, easy-seal material.Armory Additions</p><h2>Armory Additions</h2><p>Many of the food and drinks consumed in the Pact Worlds are mass-produced using UPBs and culinary synthesizers (see page 129), and supplemented with more traditional agricultural produce where possible. The meals presented on page 233 of the Core Rulebook are readily available almost anywhere and include both ready-to-eat fast food and premeasured and precut ingredients that you can cook. However, most population centers have a wide variety of restaurants in various settings where patrons can enjoy dining on a selection of foods.</p><h2>Dining</h2><p>Options for dining out can be divided into two broad categories: chain restaurants and independent venues. Chain restaurants are ubiquitous and tend to be cheaper, but they have less variety and the food is lower quality. Independent venues are more expensive, but they often employ master chefs who create the highest-quality food in all the Pact Worlds. The prices listed in Table 1–33 are averages, and the quality of the restaurant corresponds to the quality of the meals served (Core Rulebook 233). Dining at independent venues with well-known or famous chefs can be even more expensive, with prices equal to the head chef’s total skill bonus in Life Science multiplied by 10.</p><h2>Pact Worlds Cuisines</h2><p>Many Pact Worlds species have unique culinary trends. These ethnic cuisines show the breadth of options available in the Pact Worlds and do not affect the price of food or meals.</p><ul><li><p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">Kasathas</span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Kasathan recipes are usually traditional and<br />exclusively use plants and animals native to their original<br />home world of Kasath. Kasathan cuisine has a decidedly alien<br />appearance that many other species find disturbing, though<br />most dishes are surprisingly savory and delectable.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">Lashuntas</span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Lashuntas delight in using local flora and fauna in<br />their cuisine, emphasizing the use of native berries, fruits, and<br />nuts to make delightfully palatable dishes. Lashuntas consume<br />a variety of animal products, but arthropod meat—especially<br />from giant insects—is most common. According to some old<br />stories, lashuntas adopted this custom as an insult to their<br />ancient enemies on Castrovel, the insectile formians.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">Shirrens</span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">While artfully prepared, traditional shirren cuisine<br />is almost always served raw, accompanied by honeys and<br />nectars as both drinks and sauces for other dishes. Shirrens<br />also eat meat in addition to vegetarian fare, though they prefer<br />vermin and other lower life-forms, consumed still living and<br />moving. To many shirrens, food is yet another choice in which<br />they can express their individualism, and they are more than<br />willing to experiment with other foods, often incorporating<br />elements of other cuisines into their cooking.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">Vesk</span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Vesk food tends to be pragmatic and utilitarian, as if<br />every dish were handcrafted by a drill sergeant who didn’t care<br />much for cooking. The exception to this rule is meat, which<br />any self-respecting vesk agrees is the most crucial component<br />of any meal. Vesk treat preparing and seasoning meat as an<br />art, assimilating and enhancing each new world’s recipes for<br />cooking meat almost as quickly as they conquer them.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">Ysoki</span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle6\">: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The fact that ysoki will eat whatever they can get their<br />paws on is largely reflected in their cooking. Ysoki fare tends to<br />be scavenged meats and cheeses served either as finger foods<br />or in stews, and the food is often questionable in color, quality,<br />and texture. Many other species tend to avoid eating ysoki<br />cuisine if they can help it.</span></p></li></ul><h2>Table: Food and Drinks</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>ITEM</strong></td><td><strong>PRICE</strong></td><td><strong>BULK</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>INTOXICANT</strong></td><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.HR97t8Ay34JaOcmY]{Minor}</td><td>1</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.knq8nJCkYT937KFO]{Superior}</td><td>10+</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MEAL</strong></td><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.gVY1amatMKF3yulF]{Poor}</td><td>1</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.LNdt7djQIqh8RbWm]{Common}</td><td>3</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Ikh8PY29MlfURsEY]{Good}</td><td>5</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OTHER</strong></td><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.rAOula25Uqzzpsx1]{Field ration}</td><td>1/week</td><td>1/week</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.EwV5WQywlWWT3dKw]{R2E}</td><td>1</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RESTAURANT DINING</strong></td><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Poor chain</td><td>2</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>Common chain</td><td>10</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>Good chain</td><td>25</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>Common independent venue</td><td>20</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>Good independent venue</td><td>50</td><th></th></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"gTTM9k4Cy5Bhxw14","name":"Transportation","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":500000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 234, AR pg. 135</p><p>Travel prices assume transport at a typical, second-class, basic level of accommodation and assistance—for example, being assigned to common guest quarters on a starship (with six passengers per room), having an assigned seat on a grav-train, waiting a few minutes for a nearby robo-taxi to pick you up, and so on. More private and luxurious travel options normally exist, costing anywhere from two to 10 times as much. Starships in particular often have good and luxurious quarters that offer better accommodations (see the guest quarters expansion bay option on page 299 for more details on the amenities of each typical level of starship accommodations). Truly exceptional options exist for the ultrarich, which can cost 1,000 times as much as common travel.</p><p>Cheaper options are often also available, such as steerage transportation in a converted cargo hold, or standing-room-only cars for grav-train rides. These normally cost half to one-quarter the listed price, though at the GM’s discretion even cheaper options (possibly those illegally ignoring various safety laws) could exist.</p><p>It is sometimes possible to procure long-distance passage at reduced prices or even for free by providing a desired service for the transport provider. Taking on common jobs such as a guard, gunner, cook, entertainer, or porter can sometimes facilitate travel on a tight budget. The prices given also assume a Medium or Small creature with no need for special accommodations or environmental conditions different from those of the vessel used. Unusually large creatures or those that require different atmospheres, gravity levels, or light levels than the vessel transporting them can easily see the price double, triple, or more depending on the inconvenience and risks involved.</p><h2>Grav-Train</h2><p>A grav-train is a hovering, multisection mass transport that runs a specific ground route, generally over a metal or ceramic rail. It is the cheapest way to move overland, but it requires significant infrastructure to operate and only runs to set locations on a (sometimes unreliable) schedule.</p><h2>Robo-Taxi</h2><p>This simple form of urban transport is generally similar to an urban cruiser but is assumed not to have the expense of a driver In most major cities, dispatch can send a robo-taxi within a few minutes of a request to the company by infosphere or comm unit.</p><h2>Sea Vessel</h2><p>Planets with large bodies of water often develop extensive commerce and transit networks by ship, hovership, and even submarine. This transport is slower than travel by plane, but cheaper per mile (and considered more relaxing by many travelers). Some planets have rigid lighter-than-air vessels as well, such as dirigibles, which tend to have similar accommodations, pricing, and speeds.</p><h2>Starship</h2><p>Travelers between planets almost exclusively use starships, most often those with Drift drives (though orbital shuttles and short-range transports traveling between moons or asteroids close to one another typically do not use Drift engines).</p><h2>Suborbital Flight</h2><p>For quick trips from point to point on a planet, the fastest option is generally a suborbital flight. The price assumes a single seat and a small common area for storage; larger seats or even small cabins cost five to 10 times as much.</p><p></p><p><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Following transport option is from Starfinder: Armory</span></span></em></p><h4>In addition to the common travel options detailed in the Core Rulebook, some worlds make use of several other transportation methods</h4><h2>Biological Transport</h2><p>Most civilized planets rely on technological transportation, but less-developed worlds often utilize living creatures for travel. Such creatures are as varied in size, shape, color, and features as the planets they inhabit. Typically, biological transport is slower and more expensive than automated travel, but in frontier regions, it may be the only option available. Biological transport can be rented on a daily basis, with prices determined by the size of the creature. The listed price does not include the cost of feeding and maintaining the creature. Generally, rented biological transport requires riders to control and direct the creatures, using the ride a creature task of the Survival skill.</p><p>Alternatively, you can simply purchase a ride on biological transport, with prices determined by the size of the creature and the distance traveled. For Large or larger creatures, the listed price typically includes a trained handler for that animal who directs it toward your destination</p><h2>Table: Transportation</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Price</th></tr><tr><td> Grav-Train Passage</td><td> 1 per 100 miles</td></tr><tr><td> Robo-Taxi Passage</td><td> 1 per 10 miles</td></tr><tr><td> Sea Vessel Passage</td><td> 1 per 50 miles</td></tr><tr><td> Suborbital Flight</td><td> 1 per 25 miles</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Colossal Creature (Rent)</td><td> 3,000 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Colossal Creature (Ride)</td><td> 100 per mile</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Gargantuan Creature (Rent)</td><td> 650 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Garganutan Creature (Ride)</td><td> 300 per mile</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Huge Creature (Rent)</td><td> 125 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Huge Creature (Ride)</td><td> 10 per mile</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Large Creature (Ride)</td><td> 5 per mile</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, LargeCreature (Rent)</td><td> 25 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Medium Creature (Rent)</td><td> 5 per day</td></tr><tr><td> Biological Transport, Medium Creature (Ride)</td><td> 2 per mile</td></tr><tr><td> Starship Passage, Common</td><td> 50 per day of travel</td></tr><tr><td> Starship Passage, Good</td><td> 300 per day of travel</td></tr><tr><td> Starship Passage, Luxurious</td><td> 1,000 per day of travel</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"afLxCsy79e6zlyLG","name":"Crafting Equipment and Magic Items","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":600000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p>Rather than buying mass-produced, mass-marketed equipment, characters with the right skills can construct their own equipment. This takes time, and due to the economies of scale enjoyed by multisystem corporations and shops with dedicated construction machines and drones, it does not save you any money. However, it allows you to acquire exactly what you need, as long as you can meet the construction requirements.</p><p>A player character can create all the items presented in this chapter as long as he has the skills, materials, tools, and time needed to construct it. He must have a number of ranks in the appropriate skill equal to the item level of the item to be created. For weapons, armor, vehicles, and technological equipment, the appropriate skill is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.76u4HnGcAlySicb4]{Engineering}. For magic fusions and magic items, the appropriate skill is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism}. For hybrid items, you must have the required ranks in both Engineering and Mysticism.

For any food or drink, the appropriate skill is Life Science. For computers, you can use either @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.IqOCYDKd9NgBwowp]{Computers} or Engineering, and you can construct a computer with a tier equal to half your ranks in the skill. For items that are not considered any of these categories (such as most clothes, tents, and so on) either Engineering or Mysticism can be used. At a GM’s discretion, an appropriate @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.bD4kmdFU7wwsenOf]{Profession} skill can be used for a narrower range of items. For example, a character with Profession (weaponsmith) might be able to make technological, hybrid, and magic weapons and weapon fusions, but no other items.</p><p>Crafting items requires you to have access to tools and a workshop or similar space. Most starships have an appropriate area set aside, and such space can be rented at the same price as @UUID[.m2QaMoUIFmUHppEC#lodgings]{lodgings} in major cities (with the size of the lodging being equivalent to the size of the workshop, which limits the size of items that can be constructed and how many people can work on a single item at one time). Creating an item normally has a base time of 4 hours. If your number of ranks in the appropriate skill to craft an item exceeds that item’s level by 5 or more, you can craft that item in half the base time. If your ranks exceed the item level by 10 or more, you can create the item in onequarter the base time. Objects larger than a Medium creature take twice as long to craft for each size category larger.</p><p>To create an item, you must have UPBs with a total value equal to the price of the item to be created. At the GM’s discretion, you can scavenge similar items for parts, allowing 10% of the scavenged item’s value to count toward the UPBs needed. Even magic and hybrid items are created using UPBs, as the Mysticism skill is used to form the materials into runes and specific implements for rituals utilized in the creation of magic devices.</p><p>Custom-built equipment has a few advantages over massproduced items. If you have a skill that allows you to repair an item you crafted, you can do so in half the normal time.

Many hazards of space can be mitigated by wearing armor (see page 196) or a standard @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.KF7ltBV698hPOQz8]{Space Suit} (see page 231), but sometimes unlucky spacefaring adventurers get caught without them!</p><h2>Cosmic Rays</h2><p>“Cosmic rays” is a catchall term for various interstellar radiation effects.

These planets, planetoids, and stars are the hub of much adventure and vary in complexity of design and makeup. A brief summary of the different types of astronomical objects is presented below, along with various rules associated with each.</p><h2>Classification Of Astronomical Objects</h2><p>There exist several different types of astronomical objects. Summarized below are the most prominent types encountered during interstellar exploration.</p><h3>Asteroid</h3><p>An asteroid is a fractured chunk of matter, notable for being too small to be considered a proper planetoid. Asteroids commonly lack any sort of ecosystem and are often bereft of an atmosphere and breathable air. Many see asteroids as exploitable resources, given that they are often rich in minerals of varying rarity.</p><h3>Gas Giant</h3><p>As their name suggests, gas giants are worlds composed entirely of gas—frequently elements such as hydrogen and helium. They lack any natural solid surfaces to walk on and so have no proper ground. Creatures unable to fly or without flight-capable equipment or magic tumble toward the dense core of the world at the falling speed of a standard-gravity planet. Such a fall often takes days, given the immense size of these worlds. Near the center of a gas giant, a creature is subject to @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#extreme-gravity]{extreme gravity} (see page 402). The heart of a gas giant acts in many ways like a star (see Star below), including destroying creatures that don’t have full immunity to fire.</p><h3>Irregular World</h3><p>Some planets exist outside of the typical description of a (mostly) spherical mass of gases or silicate rocks and metals. These irregular worlds come in a variety of shapes, many of which are still considered theoretical. Some worlds might be artificially designed in the shape of a torus. Other worlds, like a planet in the form of a cube or a world that is entirely flat, exist as the result of cosmic abnormalities or the direct intervention of the divine.</p><h3>Satellite</h3><p>Satellites are objects, such as moons, orbiting any other form of planetoid. “Satellite” is a classification that can be applied to other astronomical objects as well, as many asteroids and terrestrial worlds are also satellites. Unlike other types of astronomical objects, a satellite isn’t necessarily a natural object. Alien markers and space stations are but a few types of artificial constructs that hang in the gravitational field of planets. Some planets have only a single moon, while others (such as gas giants) boast dozens of objects caught in their gravitational fields.</p><h3>Star</h3><p>A star—sometimes multiple stars—typically rests at the heart of a planetary system. Stars are massive balls of incandescent plasma that blast their orbiting planetoids with heat. While there are various categorizations of stars, from blue dwarf stars to yellow hypergiants, all stars produce enough heat to pose similar hazards to most adventurers. The surface of a star is so hot that only full immunity to fire allows a creature to survive there. Any creatures or items not immune to fire are instantly and utterly consumed down to the molecular level—only spells such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.i3lpfndXeLq85h12]{miracle} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.i4KITExV7vMeoM24]{wish} can bring back such victims.</p><ul><li><strong>Solar Flares:</strong> Occasionally, stars let off bursts of intense energy, visible upon their surfaces as flares of roiling plasma. These disturbances have a deadly and immediate effect on things on or near the surfaces of such turbulent stars. The peripheral danger of these flares is the devastating effect they have on unshielded electronic equipment and radio communications. These distortions can be felt millions of miles away from the star, and typically they cause various electronics and radio communications to cease functioning for 6d6×10 minutes.</li></ul><h3>Terrestrial World</h3><p>  Most people use the word “planet” to refer to a terrestrial world. The ones closest to the star of a solar system are the worlds most likely to be naturally habitable. They’re home to varying ecosystems, from barren, rocky landscapes to vibrant jungles of lush plant life and rushing waterways. Such worlds are sometimes categorized by their predominant features, leading to titles such as desert world, ice world, jungle world, and lava world.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"NOrSFYXShdxot60k","name":"Atmospheres","type":"text","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.sfrpg.rules.z2JnsaHKE5QvwVSQ.JournalEntryPage.NOrSFYXShdxot60k"}},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":1300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 395</p><p>An atmosphere is a layer of gases held in place by the pull of a planetoid’s gravity. The gravity and temperature of a planetoid impact its ability to retain an atmosphere. Most planets and planetoids support some manner of atmosphere. In addition to hospitable atmospheres, there are various other types of atmosphere that serve as hazards to most life.</p><h2>Corrosive</h2><p>As the name suggests, a corrosive atmosphere eats away at matter. The type and speed of the erosion varies, but the most common use of this term describes atmospheres capable of dissolving most matter. A typical corrosive atmosphere deals anywhere from 1 acid damage per minute up to 10d6 acid damage per round to creatures and objects within. Certain metals and treated materials may be immune to the specific atmosphere of a planet, and often the corrosion can be mitigated with dutiful preparation.</p><h2>No Atmosphere</h2><p>A creature on a planet without an atmosphere (or with an atmosphere so thin that it is effectively airless) is exposed to a vacuum (see page 394).</p><h2>Normal</h2><p>A normal atmosphere is one that can support the majority of breathing life-forms. Most such atmospheres are composed of some combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and other nontoxic gases.</p><h2>Thick</h2><p>A nonacclimated creature operating in a thick atmosphere treats it as somewhat harmful, due to the extra chemical compounds in the air and the increased atmospheric pressure. Every hour, such a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or become sickened. This condition ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere. Conversely, the increased weight of the air grants a +4 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly or Piloting checks to keep an aircraft in flight.</p><p>Severely thick atmospheres are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature in such an atmosphere must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate (see @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} on page 404) as its lungs cease coping with the density of the oxygen inhaled and lose the strength to keep pumping air into its bloodstream.</p><h2>Thin</h2><p>Thinner atmospheres tend to cause a nonacclimated creature to have difficulty breathing and become extremely tired. A typical thin atmosphere requires such a creature to succeed at a Fortitude save each hour (DC = 15 +1 per previous check) or become fatigued. The fatigue ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere.</p><p>Severely thin atmospheres can cause long-term oxygen deprivation to those affected in addition to the effects of a standard thin atmosphere. The first time a creature in a severely thin atmosphere fails its Fortitude save, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 damage to all ability scores. A creature acclimated to high altitude (see Hill and Mountain Terrain on page 397) gains a +4 insight bonus to its saving throw to resist this effect.</p><h2>Toxic</h2><p>Toxic atmospheres are composed of poisonous compounds and vary radically in their consistencies. Some toxic atmospheres are capable of sustaining oxygen-breathing life-forms, while others immediately suffocate those within them. Regardless of whether or not they allow creatures to breathe, toxic atmospheres are threats to most living creatures, as they act as an inhaled poison (see page 417). Though the specific type of poison varies, many toxic atmospheres act as existing poisons but with radically different onset times and save DCs. Low-level toxic atmospheres can have onset times measured in hours or days, while heavily toxic atmospheres have onset times measured in rounds.</p><h2>Strange Atmospheres</h2><p>Though it happens rarely, some astronomical objects have atmospheres that seem to defy the laws of reality—usually due to magical interference or technology run amok. Sometimes these atmospheres are infused with a certain type of energy. Such atmospheres function like corrosive atmospheres, except they deal damage of the appropriate energy type (electricity, fire, sonic, etc.).</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"Gf0dltAXIpCzjMl0","name":"Biomes","type":"text","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Yv0sYlPqJmwLak2w.JournalEntryPage.Gf0dltAXIpCzjMl0"}},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 396</p><p>The following section includes information on a variety of biomes found on planets. Some planets could be entirely made up of a single bi<span class=\"fontstyle0\">ome, such as desert or forest worlds, while other planets contain a mix of the following terrain types.</span></p><h2>Aerial Terrain</h2><p>On worlds where the atmosphere expands high above the physical boundaries of the surface, there exists a region of open air. Similarly, gas giants are made up of nothing more than a vast atmosphere, held in place by a starlike core. The most common rules sections to reference when using aerial terrain are @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#falling]{Falling} (see page 400), @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#gravity]{Gravity} (see page 401), @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), and @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG]{Weather} (see page 398). The rules for flying with the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} skill are also critical for many creatures operating in an aerial environment.</p><h3>Clouds</h3><p>Most clouds are little more than condensed gas that obfuscates vision. Treat a cloud in an aerial environment using the same rules as fog cloud, except it’s a nonmagical effect. Other types of cloud exist, such as corrosive or toxic clouds, which operate in the same manner as those types of atmospheres (see above).</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In Aerial Terrain</h3><p>How far a character can see in the air depends on the presence or absence of clouds. Creatures can usually see 5d8×100 feet if the sky is completely clear, with minimal clouds (or other aerial objects) blocking their views. Clouds generally provide enough concealment to hide within (though the hiding creature might have difficulty seeing out from its hiding place).</p><h2>Aquatic Terrain</h2><p>Aquatic terrain can be one of the least hospitable to PCs because most can’t breathe underwater. The ocean floor holds many marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the other terrain elements described in this chapter, but if characters find themselves in the water because they were bull-rushed off the back of a transport ship, the kelp beds or volcanic vents hundreds of feet below them don’t matter. The most common rules sections to reference when using aquatic terrain are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404) and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#underwater-combat]{Underwater Combat} (see page 405). The rules for swimming with the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} skill (see page 137) are also critical for many creatures operating in an aquatic environment.</p><h3>Deep Water</h3><p>Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Athletics checks to move through (typically, DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water, and DC 30 in maelstrom water). Characters need a way to breathe if they’re underwater; lacking that, they risk drowning. When underwater, characters can move in any direction, including up and down.</p><h3>Extreme Depths</h3><p>At certain depths, the pressure of the surrounding water becomes so great that characters might be affected as if they were in a thick or severely thick atmosphere (see page 396), even if they can breathe underwater.</p><h3>Stealth And Detection Underwater</h3><p>How far a character can see underwater depends on the water’s clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8×100 feet if the water is clear and 1d8×10 feet in murky water. Running water is always murky, unless it’s in a particularly large, slow-moving river. It is hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the sea floor).</p><h3>Expanded Aquatic Rules</h3><p><strong>Source:</strong> AP #36 pg. 47</p><p>The following rules represent a compilation of and expansion on the rules for underwater adventure presented in various sections of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. Most of these rules relate to creatures that are completely submerged, except where noted otherwise.</p><h3>@UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning-expanded-rules]{Suffocation and Drowning Expanded Rules}</h3><h3>@UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#underwater-combat-expanded-rules]{Underwater Combat Expanded rules}</h3><h3>Surviving Underwater</h3><p>Most Starfinder adventures assume that the PCs wear armor which affords environmental protections for a number of days equal to its item level (expended in 1-hour increments) unless otherwise specified. These protections provide two primary benefits to a submersed creature: self-contained breathing and protection from the pressures of extreme depths, as described below. The space suit personal item also provides these protections.</p><p>Most adventures assume that NPCs have adapted to their native environments and therefore ignore many of the dangers and penalties that follow.</p><h3>Extreme Depth</h3><p>At certain depths, the pressure of the surrounding water becomes so great that it endangers non-adapted creatures (such as most PCs, including aquatic species).</p><p>A creature in deep water (100–999 feet deep) must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or gain the sickened condition. This condition ends when the creature returns to a normal depth.</p><p>Severe depths (1,000 feet or deeper) are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature not accustomed to these depths that needs to breathe must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate as though they’ve lost access to air (see Suffocation and Drowning above). In addition, every hour while at these depths, all such creatures without environmental protections must succeed at an additional Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 cold damage.</p><p>Note that even aquatic creatures and others able to breathe underwater (or who don’t breathe at all) are still subject to the non-suffocation effects described above.</p><h3>Underwater Movement</h3><p>Moving underwater can prove difficult for land-based creatures that don’t have a natural swim speed. Those with swim speeds (whether from their species, gear, magic, or some other effect) have distinct advantages.</p><h3>Swimming Without a Swim Speed</h3><p>A creature that takes a move action to move its speed while underwater must choose a direction to swim (including up or down) and attempt an Athletics check to swim. The DC of this check is 10 in calm water but increases in rough conditions (DC 15), stormy conditions (DC 20), and maelstrom conditions (DC 30). Strong currents, debris, and other environmental conditions can increase this DC further. A creature can’t take 10 to swim in combat or in stormy or maelstrom conditions, even if not distracted or in immediate danger.</p><p>On a successful check to swim, the creature moves half its land speed in a straight line in its chosen direction. If the creature wants to change direction (including ascending or descending) while swimming, it costs an additional 5 feet of movement to turn 45 degrees. See the Swimming Example below for an example of a creature swimming and changing direction.</p><p>If a creature fails a check to swim by 4 or less, it makes no progress. If it fails by 5 or more, it sinks, moving 5 feet directly downward.</p><p>Every hour while swimming, a creature without a swim speed must succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check or take 1d6 nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p><h3>Swimming Example</h3><p>Suppose a creature has a swim speed of 30 feet. With a successful check to swim (if required), it can swim forward 5 feet, turn 45 degrees to the left, and swim 5 feet diagonally, all of which costs a total of 15 feet of its movement. The creature can then turn 90 degrees to ascend 5 feet straight up, which costs another 15 feet of movement (10 feet to change its direction and 5 feet to move). At this point, it has used its 30 feet of swimming movement, so its move action ends.</p><h3>Swimming With A Swim Speed</h3><p>If a creature has a swim speed (whether from its species or another source), it can move that full swim speed when it takes a move action to move its speed. This movement uses the same rules presented in the Swimming Example below, which also provides an example of a creature swimming and changing direction.</p><p>A creature with a swim speed doesn’t need to attempt an Athletics check to swim except in hazardous circumstances, including stormy and maelstrom conditions. It also gains a +8 bonus to Athletics checks to swim and can always take 10 while swimming, even during combat and when distracted or in immediate danger. Creatures with a swim speed can also use the run action while swimming, provided that they swim in a straight line.</p><p>A creature with a swim speed (such as from their species) doesn’t need to attempt an Athletics check to avoid fatigue damage for each hour it swims.</p><h2>Desert Terrain</h2><p>Desert terrain exists in cold, temperate, and warm climates, but all deserts share one common trait: very little precipitation. The three categories of desert terrain are tundra (cold desert), rocky deserts (often temperate), and sandy deserts (often warm). The most common rules sections to reference for adventures in these areas are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#cold-dangers]{Cold Dangers} (see page 400), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#heat-dangers]{Heat Dangers} (see page 402), Starvation and Thirst (see page 404), and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG]{Weather} (see page 398).</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In The Desert</h3><p>In general, the maximum distance in desert terrain at which a creature can succeed at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check to detect the presence of others is 6d6×20 feet; beyond this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm deserts makes sight-based Perception checks impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts limits spotting distance to 6d6×10 feet. The scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer concealment or cover makes using Stealth more difficult.</p><h2>Forest Terrain</h2><p>A forest can be composed of more than trees. On some worlds, vast fungal growths tower into the sky, while on others metallic veins rise from the ground and connect in spidery canopies. Common rules sections to reference for forests are Catching on Fire (see @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#heat-dangers]{Heat Dangers} page 403), Falling Objects (see @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#falling]{Falling} page 401), Smoke Effects (see page 404), and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.7MyEhuifQLwaPZ8e.JournalEntryPage.eRuw7PyvI33WDzvu#vision-and-light]{Vision and Light} (see page 261).</p><h3>Trees</h3><p>Most forests are filled with trees, or something akin to trees, which provide partial cover to those standing in the same square as a tree. An average tree has an AC of 4, a hardness of 5, and 150 HP (see page 409 for rules on @UUID[.ftqreMQkNpYDxpxY#smashing-an-object]{smashing an object}). A successful DC 15 Athletics check is enough to climb most trees.</p><h3>Undergrowth</h3><p>Fungal blooms, vines, roots, and short bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. Undergrowth counts as difficult terrain (see page 257), provides concealment (20% miss chance), and increases the DCs of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren’t mutually exclusive; it’s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In A Forest</h3><p>In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check to detect the presence of others is 3d6×10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8×10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6×10 feet.</p><p>Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it’s usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill to hide. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p><p>The background noise of a forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, usually increasing the DC of the check at the GM’s discretion.</p><h2>Hill And Mountain Terrain</h2><p>Hill terrain describes rises in the immediate area, often multiple hills spread over miles. This type of terrain can occur in any other biome. Mountains are steeply rising rock, metal, or even the organic crust of the planet. The most common rules sections to reference when using hill and mountain terrain are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#cold-dangers]{Cold Dangers} (see page 400), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#falling]{Falling} (see page 400), and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG]{Weather} (see page 398).</p><h3>Chasms</h3><p>Usually formed by natural geological processes, chasms are common dangers in mountainous areas. Chasms aren’t hidden, so characters won’t (usually) fall into them by accident. A typical chasm is 2d4×10 feet deep, at least 20 feet long, and anywhere from 5 to 20 feet wide. It usually requires a successful DC 15 @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} check to climb the wall of a chasm. In mountain terrain, chasms are typically 2d8×10 feet deep.</p><h3>Rock Wall</h3><p>A vertical plane of stone, a rock wall requires one or more successful DC 25 @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} checks to ascend. A typical rock wall is from 2d4×10 feet tall to 2d8×10 feet tall.</p><h3>High Altitude</h3><p>At particularly high altitudes, the thinning atmosphere poses a challenge for many creatures, with the same effects as a @UUID[.NOrSFYXShdxot60k#thin]{thin atmosphere} (see page 396). A creature residing at a high altitude for 1 month becomes acclimated and no longer takes these penalties, but it loses this benefit if it spends more than 2 months away from high-altitude terrain and must reacclimatize upon returning.</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In Hills And Mountains</h3><p>As a guideline, the maximum distance in mountain terrain at which a creature can succeed at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check to detect the presence of others is 4d10×10 feet. In hill terrain, the maximum distance is 2d10×10 feet. It’s easier to hear distant sounds in the mountains. The DCs of Perception checks that rely on sound are usually lower at the GM’s discretion.</p><h2>Marsh Terrain</h2><p>Two categories of marsh exist: relatively dry moors and watery swamps. Both are often bordered by lakes (see page 396), which are effectively a third category of terrain found in marshes. The most common rules sections to reference for marshes and swamps are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#underwater-combat]{Underwater Combat} (see page 405), and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG]{Weather} (see below).</p><h3>Bogs</h3><p>If a square is part of a shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1 foot in depth. It counts as difficult terrain, and the DCs of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} checks attempted in such a square increase by 2.</p><p>A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It counts as difficult terrain, and Medium or larger creatures must spend 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.</p><p>The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover. Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved cover. A creature with this improved cover takes a –10 penalty to attacks against creatures that aren’t underwater.</p><p>Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares.</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In A Marsh</h3><p>In a moor, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check to detect the presence of others is 6d6×10 feet. In a swamp, this distance is 2d8×10 feet. Vegetation and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment (20% miss chance), so it is possible to use Stealth to hide in a marsh.</p><h2>Urban Terrain</h2><p>Urban terrain can be found in most settlements where the people have greatly exerted their influence over the surrounding environment, constructing buildings where they can live and work in comfort and laying well-defined roads, usually paved. This type of terrain can occur in just about any biome, and it often supersedes the environmental effects of that biome. Urban terrain can include space stations, and it is often replete with technology. The most common rules sections to reference when using urban terrain are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.6COC2LKEveQKUWSK]{Settlements} (see page 405), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.pkHPhnLbWXWTx4V9]{Structures} (see page 406), and Vehicles (see page 228), as well as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.ftqreMQkNpYDxpxY]{Breaking Objects} (see page 409) and sometimes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#radiation]{Radiation} (see page 403).</p><h3>Stealth And Detection In Urban Terrain</h3><p>In a settlement with wide, open streets, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check to detect the presence of others is 2d6×10 feet. In a settlement where the buildings are more crowded, standing close together, this distance is 1d6×10 feet. The presence of crowds might reduce this distance.</p><p>Thanks to twisting side streets and vehicles that can provide cover, it’s usually easy for a creature to use Stealth to hide in a settlement. In addition, settlements are often noisy, making Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, usually increasing the DC of the check at the GM’s discretion.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG","name":"Weather","type":"text","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Yv0sYlPqJmwLak2w.JournalEntryPage.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG"}},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2200000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 398</p><p>Weather can play an important role in an adventure.

Additional rules for @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#cold-dangers]{cold} and @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#heat-dangers]{heat} dangers can be found in Environmental Rules starting on page 400.</p><h2>Rain And Snow</h2><article><header><p>Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another. Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure vision as effectively as dense fog. Most precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. If the temperature drops from above freezing to 32° F or below, it might produce ice.</p><h3>Rain</h3><p><em>Rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a –4 penalty to </em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception}<em> checks. It has the same effect on flames and Perception checks as severe wind (see below).</em></p><h3>Snow</h3><p>Falling snow has the same effects on visibility and skill checks as rain. Snow-covered squares count as difficult terrain. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground.</p><h3>Heavy Snow</h3><p>Heavy snow has the same effects as normal snowfall but also restricts visibility as fog does @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#fog]{Fog} on page 399). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4 feet of snow on the ground. Snow at this depth counts as difficult terrain, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow. Heavy snow accompanied by @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#strong-wind]{strong} or @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#severe-wind]{severe} winds might result in snowdrifts 1d4×5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind—a reinforced wall or a large force field, for instance. There’s a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompanied by lightning @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#thunderstorm]{Thunderstorm} on page 399).</p><h3>Other Precipitation</h3><p>There are other forms of precipitation, such as freezing rain, hail, and sleet. These generally function as rain when falling, but at the GM’s discretion, they may also have effects on movement similar to snow once they accumulate on the ground.</p><h2>Storms</h2><p>The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that accompany storms reduce visibility ranges by three-quarters, imposing a –8 penalty to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} checks. Storms make aiming with ranged weapons difficult, imposing a –2 penalty to attack rolls, and archaic ranged weapons can’t be fired at all. Storms automatically extinguish unprotected flames. Storms commonly appear in three types: dust, snow, or thunder.</p><h3>Dust Storm</h3><p>These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a dust storm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most dust storms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. There is a 10% chance for a dust storm to be accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#table-11-6:-wind-effects]{Table 11–6: Wind Effects} on page 400); this greater dust storm deals 1d3 nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also poses a choking hazard (see @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} on page 404). A greater dust storm leaves 2d3–1 feet of fine sand in its wake.</p><h3>Snowstorm</h3><p>In addition to the wind and precipitation common to other types of storms, a snowstorm leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.</p><h3>Thunderstorm</h3><p>In addition to @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#winds]{wind} and @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#rain-and-snow]{precipitation}, a thunderstorm is accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters who don’t have proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm (GM rolls to hit). Each bolt deals between 4d8 and 10d8 electricity damage. One in 10 thunderstorms is accompanied by a @UUID[.llyS6o5YJKCTqKkG#tornado]{tornado}.</p><h3>Powerful Storms</h3><p>Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero and can make Perception checks and ranged weapon attacks difficult. Powerful storms are divided into the following types.</p><ul><li>Blizzard: The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d4 feet), and extreme cold make blizzards deadly for those unprepared for them.</li><li>Hurricane: In addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity is extremely difficult under such conditions.</li><li>Tornado: With incredibly high winds, tornadoes can severely injure and kill creatures pulled into their funnels.</li><li>Windstorm: While accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through the force of their winds (see Winds below).</li></ul><h2>Fog</h2><p>Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#darkvision]{darkvision}. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance).</p><h2>Winds</h2><p>Wind can create a stinging spray of dust, sand, or water, fan a large fire, rock an atmospheric transport midflight, and blow gases or vapors away. If powerful enough, it can even interfere with some ranged attacks and knock characters down. Below are the most common wind forces seen on habitable worlds.</p><h3>Table 11-6: Wind Effects</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Wind Force</td><td>Wind Speed</td><td>Ranged Attack Penalty*</td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>0–10 mph</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td>11–20 mph</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Strong</td><td>21–30 mph</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Severe</td><td>31–50 mph</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td>Windstorm</td><td>51–74 mph</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td>Hurricane</td><td>75–174 mph</td><td>–8</td></tr><tr><td>Tornado</td><td>175–300 mph</td><td>Impossible</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* This applies only to nonenergy ranged weapons. Larger weapons, such as starship weapons, ignore this penalty.</p><h3>Light Wind</h3><p>A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.</p><h3>Moderate Wind</h3><p>A steady wind often extinguishing small, unprotected flames.</p><h3>Strong Wind</h3><p>Gusts that automatically put out any unprotected flames. Such gusts impose a –2 penalty to nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls.</p><h3>Severe Wind</h3><p>Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –4 penalty.</p><h3>Windstorm</h3><p>Powerful enough to bring down branches, if not whole trees. Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –4 penalty, while attacks with archaic ranged weapons are impossible. Perception checks that rely on sound take a –8 penalty due to the howling of the wind. Small characters might be knocked down.</p><h3>Hurricane-Force Wind</h3><p>Nonenergy ranged weapon attack rolls take a –8 penalty, and archaic ranged weapon attacks are impossible. Perception checks based on sound are impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees. Most characters are knocked down due to the force of these winds.</p><h3>Tornado</h3><p>All flames are extinguished. All nonenergy ranged weapon attacks are impossible, as are sound-based Perception checks. A creature in close proximity to a tornado that fails a DC 15 Strength check is sucked toward the tornado. All creatures that come into contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage per round, before being violently expelled in a random direction (@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y]{falling damage}, described below, might apply). While a tornado’s rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.</p></header></article>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"n461i9lDXw303SiY","name":"Environmental Rules","type":"text","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Yv0sYlPqJmwLak2w.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY"}},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 400<br />The following is a compilation of rules appropriate for use in a variety of environments. </p><h2>Cold Dangers</h2><p>Cold and exposure deal nonlethal damage to the victim. A character can’t recover from the damage dealt by a cold environment until she gets out of the cold and warms up again. An unprotected character in cold weather (below 40° F) must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 nonlethal cold damage. A character can attempt Survival skill checks to gain a bonus to this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see page 148).</p><p>In conditions of severe cold (below 0° F), an unprotected character must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 nonlethal cold damage. A character can attempt Survival skill checks to gain a bonus to this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.</p><p>Extreme cold (below –20° F) deals 1d6 lethal cold damage per minute (no saving throw). In addition, a character must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or take 1d4 nonlethal cold damage. Colder environments can deal more damage at the GM’s discretion.</p><p>A character who takes any damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (same as fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.</p><h3>Ice</h3><p>Icy surfaces count as difficult terrain, and the DCs for Acrobatics checks attempted on ice increase by 5. Characters in prolonged contact with ice might run the risk of taking damage from severe cold.</p><h2>Falling</h2><p>A character that falls takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6. A character that takes damage from a fall lands prone.</p><p>If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. On a successful DC 15 @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} check, the character avoids taking damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts the damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. For example, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same character deliberately jumps, he takes 1d6 nonlethal damage and 2d6 lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, he takes only 1d6 nonlethal damage and 1d6 lethal damage from the plunge.</p><p>The damage from the first 10 feet of a fall onto a yielding surface (such as soft ground or mud) is converted into nonlethal damage. This conversion is cumulative with damage reduced through deliberate jumps and successful Acrobatics checks.</p><p>A character can’t cast a spell or activate an item while free-falling unless the fall is greater than 500 feet or the spell or item can be used as a reaction. Casting teleport or a similar spell while falling doesn’t end the character’s momentum; it just changes her location, meaning that she still takes falling damage, even if she arrives atop a solid surface.</p><h3>Falling And Gravity</h3><p>The rules for falling presented here assume standard gravity. For planets with high or low gravity, double or halve the damage amounts, respectively. Falling in extreme gravity deals as least triple the listed damage, and potentially even more.</p><h3>Falling Into Water</h3><p>Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, a falling character takes no damage for the first 20 feet fallen and 1d3 nonlethal damage per 10-foot increment for the next 20 feet fallen. Beyond that, falling damage is lethal damage as normal (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</p><p>A character who deliberately dives into water takes no damage with a successful DC 15 @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} check or DC 15 Acrobatics check, as long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. The DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.</p><h3>Falling Objects</h3><p>Just as characters take damage when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when they are hit by falling objects.</p><p>An object that falls upon a character deals damage based on its size and the distance it fell. Table 11–7: Damage from Falling Objects determines the amount of damage dealt by an object based on its size. Note that this assumes the object is made of dense, heavy material, such as metal or stone. Objects made of lighter materials might deal as little as half the listed damage, subject to the GM’s discretion. For example, a Huge boulder that hits a character deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage, whereas a Huge wooden wagon might deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage. In addition, if an object falls less than 30 feet, it deals half the listed damage. If an object falls more than 150 feet, it deals double the listed damage. Note that a falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals.</p><p>Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged attack against its KAC. Such attacks generally have a range increment of 20 feet. If an object falls on a character (instead of being thrown), that character can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage if he is aware of the object. Falling objects that are part of a trap use the trap rules (see page 410) instead of these general guidelines.</p><h3>Table 11-7: Damage from Falling Objects</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Object Size</td><td>Damage</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>4d6</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>6d6</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>8d6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>10d6</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gravity</h2><p>Gravitational differences between planets have the potential to hinder characters or make them superheroes—and sometimes both at the same time. Most planets habitable by humanoids have a gravity level defined as standard, which makes them similar enough that trying to arbitrate the difference isn’t necessary. Others, however, require special consideration. For planets with gravities that aren’t quite standard but don’t fall into the exact categories below, the GM might decide to assume the effects are proportional. For example, a planet with half standard gravity allows player characters to jump twice as high, whereas one with 1-1/2 standard gravity cuts jump heights by a third. In all cases, these effects last until the PCs adjust to the gravity (a process that typically takes about a month of living under such conditions). See Flying on page 259 for information about flying on planets with high or low gravity.</p><h3>Extreme Gravity</h3><p>A planet where the gravity is at least five times as strong as standard gravity is extremely dangerous to most creatures. In addition to the limitations of high gravity (see below), a creature in this environment takes an amount of nonlethal bludgeoning damage per round (at least 1d6, but potentially more, depending on the intensity of the gravity). Once a character takes sufficient nonlethal damage to be reduced to 0 Hit Points, any further damage from extreme gravity is lethal bludgeoning damage.</p><h3>High Gravity</h3><p>On high-gravity worlds, characters are burdened by their increased weight, and their physical abilities are affected accordingly. On a high-gravity world, where the gravity is at least twice as strong as standard gravity, a character (and her gear) weighs twice as much as on a standard-gravity world, but she has the same amount of strength. Such characters move at half speed, can jump only half as high or as far, and can lift only half as much. Thrown weapons (though not those of natives) have their ranges cut in half as they fall to the ground more rapidly. Modifications to running, jumping, and lifting can be negated by certain magic or technology, but projectiles remain affected. Characters who remain in a high-gravity environment for long periods (more than a day) often become fatigued and remain so until they leave the planet or become accustomed to the gravity.</p><h3>Low Gravity</h3><p>Low-gravity worlds are liberating to most species acclimated to standard-gravity worlds. Such characters’ muscles are far more effective than normal. On a low-gravity world, where the gravity is no greater than a third of standard gravity, PCs can jump three times as high and as far and lift three times as much. (Movement speed, however, stays the same, as moving in great bounds is awkward and difficult to control.) Thrown weapons have their range categories tripled.</p><h3>Standard</h3><p>Standard-gravity worlds have gravity approximately the same as that of lost Golarion, which is identical to Earth’s gravity.</p><h3>Zero Gravity</h3><p>Movement in zero gravity (also referred to as zero-g) is not the same as flight. Controlled movement is difficult without some form of propulsion, and creatures without something to push off from often find themselves floating aimlessly. A creature in a zero-gravity environment can’t take move actions to move its speed, crawl, or take a guarded step. If a creature is adjacent to or in the same square as an object (including a wall, floor, or ceiling) or another creature one size category smaller than itself or larger, it can take a move action to push off that object or creature, moving at half its land speed in a direction of its choosing (as appropriate); if that object or creature is movable, it begins moving in the opposite direction at that same speed.</p><ul><li><p>Moving in Zero-G: A creature that moves in a given direction continues to move in that direction at the same speed at the beginning of its turn each round (without taking any action); it must move the full distance unless it is able to change its motion by latching on to an object or creature, pushing off in a new direction, or creating thrust of some kind (all of which are considered move actions). If a creature runs into a solid object during its movement, it must succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check to safely stop its movement; failure means that creature gains the off-kilter condition (see page 276). If a creature runs into another creature during its movement, both creatures must each attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. A creature anchored to a solid object (such as by the boot clamps available with most armor) receives a +4 bonus to this check. An off-kilter creature in a zerogravity environment can steady itself as a move action that requires a surface to grab on to or some method of propulsion; alternatively, that creature can throw a single item weighing at least 4 bulk (for Medium creatures; 2 bulk for Small creatures) to reorient itself and remove the offkilter condition.<br /><br />If provided with sufficient handholds, a creature with a climb speed can move along a wall at full speed, as can any creature that succeeds at a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere, such as wings or turbofans, can’t use their fly speeds in a vacuum; once they reenter an atmosphere, they can recover and get their bearings within 1d4 rounds, after which they can fly normally. Magical flight and methods of flight that provide their own thrust, such as jump jets (see page 206), are not affected. A character in a zero-gravity environment can lift and carry 10 times her normal amount.</p></li><li>Weapons: Thrown weapons have their range increments multiplied by 10 in zero-g. In addition, all ranged weapons no longer have a maximum number of range increments—their wielders simply continue to accrue penalties the farther away the target is.</li></ul><h2>Heat Dangers</h2><p>Heat deals nonlethal damage to the victim. A character can’t recover from the damage dealt by a hot environment until she gets out of the heat and cools off.<br /><br />A character in very hot conditions (above 90° F) must attempt a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty to their saving throws. A character can attempt a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.UDTsEIldhXTn0VJA]{Survival} check to receive a bonus to this saving throw, and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see page 148).<br /><br />In severe heat (above 110° F), a character must attempt a Fortitude saving throw once every 10 minutes (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty to their saves. A character can attempt a Survival check to receive a bonus to this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see page 148).<br /><br />Extreme heat (air temperature over 140° F, boiling water, fire, and lava) deals lethal fire damage. Breathing air in extreme heat deals 1d6 fire damage per minute (no saving throw). In addition, a character must attempt a Fortitude saving throw every 5 minutes (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d4 nonlethal fire damage. Hotter environments can deal more damage at the GM’s discretion.<br /><br />A character who takes any damage from heat exposure suffers from heatstroke (same as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.JGFn4MrDZ6X5vrzU]{fatigued} condition; see page 276). These penalties end when the character recovers from the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.<br /><br />Boiling water deals anywhere from 1d6 to 10d6 fire damage per round of exposure, depending on water temperature and level of immersion.</p><h3>Catching On Fire</h3><p>Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and noninstantaneous magical fires might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Spells or technological items with an instantaneous effect don’t normally set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and go in a flash.<br /><br />A character at risk of catching fire must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (usually DC 15) or gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{burning} condition (see page 273). Those whose clothes or equipment catch fire must attempt a separate Reflex saving throw (at the same DC) for each item. On a failed saving throw, flammable items take the same amount of damage as the character.</p><h3>Lava Effects</h3><p>Lava or magma deals a minimum of 2d6 fire damage per round of exposure, while cases of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano) deal upward of 20d6 fire damage per round. The exact damage is left to the GM’s discretion, based on situational terrain elements.<br /><br />Damage from lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 per round). Immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity or resistance to lava or magma. A creature immune or resistant to fire might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see @UUID[.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning }on page 404).</p><h2>Radiation</h2><p>Radiation is a very real threat to adventurers, whether it’s the radiation emitted from stars or the radiation generated by various technological wonders of the universe. Radiation is a poison effect (see page 414) that weakens an affected creature’s Constitution and can also inflict an affected creature with a disease called radiation sickness. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe. The effects of these categories of radiation are described on Table 11–8: Radiation Levels.</p><h3>Area Of Effect</h3><p>Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.</p><h3>Curing Radiation Effects</h3><p>A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting remove radioactivity has the same effect. As usual for poison effects, an affected creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. Remove affliction doesn’t cure a creature of the effects of radiation poisoning, but remove radioactivity does.</p><p> If a creature has been exposed to enough radiation, it might contract radiation sickness, which acts like a noncontagious disease. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair. Radiation sickness can be treated like any disease, although it can’t be cured with remove affliction. Remove radioactivity can cure radiation sickness.</p><h3>Radiation (@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poison effect})</h3><p><strong>Type </strong>poison, emanation (see above); <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude (see chart)</p><p><strong>Track </strong>Constitution; <strong>Frequency </strong>1/round</p><p><strong>Effect </strong>At each state of impaired and beyond, the victim must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or contract the radiation sickness disease (see below).</p><p><strong>Cure </strong>none</p><h3>Radiation Sickness (@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Disease effect})</h3><p><strong>Type </strong>disease; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude (same DC as the level of radiation that caused the radiation sickness)</p><p><strong>Track </strong>physical; <strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p><p><strong>Effect </strong>Radiation sickness isn’t contagious.</p><p><strong>Cure </strong>3 consecutive saves</p><h3>Radiation Levels</h3><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td>Radiation Level</td><td>Fortitude Save DC</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Severe</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Sleep Deprivation</h2><p>A character who needs to sleep must get at least 6 hours of sleep every night. If she doesn’t, she must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) after each night she doesn’t sleep enough. The first failed check causes her to become fatigued and take a –1 penalty to saving throws against effects that cause the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.3iTdt2NRgIyrychR]{asleep} condition (see page 273). A second failed check causes her to become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{exhausted}, and the penalty to saving throws against effects that cause the asleep condition increases to –2.</p><h2>Smoke Effects</h2><p>A character who inhales heavy smoke must attempt a Fortitude save each round she’s within the smoke (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Smoke obscures vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance).</p><h2>Starvation and Thirst</h2><p>Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium characters need at least a gallon of fluids per day to avoid thirst and about a pound of decent food per day to avoid starvation; Small characters need half as much. In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water to avoid thirst.</p><p>A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the character must succeed at a Constitution check each hour (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 nonlethal damage.</p><p>A character can go without eating food for 3 days. After this time, the character must succeed at a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) each day or take 1d6 nonlethal damage.</p><p>A character who has taken any damage from lack of food or water is fatigued. Damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed—not even magic that restores Hit Points heals this damage.</p><h2>Suffocation and Drowning</h2><p>A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to twice her Constitution score. If a character takes a standard or full action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After these rounds have elapsed, the character must attempt a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) each round in order to continue holding her breath.</p><p>When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she is reduced to 0 Hit Points and is unconscious and stable. In the following round, she is no longer stable and begins dying (see page 275). In the third round, she suffocates and dies.</p><p>An unconscious character must begin attempting Constitution checks immediately upon losing air supply (or upon becoming unconscious, if the character was conscious when her air was cut off). Once she fails one of these checks, she immediately drops to 0 Hit Points and is dying (see page 275). On the following round, she suffocates and dies.</p><h3>Slow Suffocation</h3><p>A Medium creature can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed cubic chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the creature takes 1d6 nonlethal damage every 15 minutes.</p><p>Each additional Medium creature or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last (two Medium creatures will run out of air in 3 hours, and so on). Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters. A creature stuck in a starship or space station whose life support systems have completely failed will run out of breathable air in a similar fashion; while these structures are often larger than a 10-foot cube, they are also often occupied by several creatures. On average, a crew of four in a Medium starship without a source of fresh air can breathe easily for 20 hours.</p><h3>Suffocation and Drowning Expanded Rules</h3><p><strong>Source:</strong> AP #36 pg. 47</p><p>Unless a creature has a way to breathe underwater (or doesn’t need to breathe), it must hold its breath or risk drowning. A creature can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. If the creature takes a standard or full action, the remaining duration that the creature can hold its breath is reduced by 1 round. After these rounds have elapsed, the creature must attempt a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. When the creature fails one of these Constitution checks, it begins to suffocate. On the first round of suffocation, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and becomes unconscious (but stable). The following round, it is no longer stable and gains the dying condition. On the third round, the creature suffocates and dies.</p><p>An unconscious character must begin attempting Constitution checks immediately upon losing air access (or upon becoming unconscious, if the character was conscious when they lost access to air). Once the character fails one of these checks, they are immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition. On the following round, they suffocate and die.</p><p>Certain effects, such as androids’ constructed racial trait, the life bubble spell, and the water breathing universal creature rule allow creatures to mitigate or ignore this danger.</p><h2>Underwater Combat</h2><p>Land-based creatures usually have considerable difficulty when fighting in water, as it affects a creature’s attack rolls, damage, and movement (see page 137 for more on swimming). The following adjustments apply whenever a character is swimming, walking in chest-deep water, or walking along the bottom of a body of water.</p><h3>Attacks From Land</h3><p>Characters swimming or floating in water that is at least chest deep and characters who are fully immersed have cover against attacks made from the surface.</p><h3>Attacks Underwater</h3><p>Most attacks made underwater take a –2 penalty and deal half damage. Attacks that deal fire damage do only one-quarter damage. Attacks that deal electricity damage take a –4 penalty rather than a –2 penalty. Melee attacks that deal piercing damage deal full damage. Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land.</p><h3>Spellcasting Underwater</h3><p>A creature that is attempting Constitution checks to hold its breath can’t concentrate enough to cast spells. Some spells might work differently underwater, subject to the GM’s discretion.</p><h3>Underwater Combat Expanded rules</h3><p><strong>Source: </strong>AP #36 pg. 47</p><p>Non-marine creatures often have considerable difficulty fighting in water. The following adjustments apply whenever a character walks in chest-deep water, becomes fully submerged, or traverses along the bottom of a body of water.</p><p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Attacks made underwater take a –2 penalty. Attacks that deal electricity damage take a –4 penalty instead of a –2 penalty.</p><p><strong>Attacks from above Water:</strong> Characters have cover against attacks originating from above water in the following situations: characters are fully immersed, or they’re swimming or floating at least chest-deep in water.</p><p><strong>Thrown Weapons:</strong> When used underwater, the range of thrown weapons is reduced to a maximum of 5 feet; this limitation overrides any abilities that normally increase a thrown weapon’s range or range increment (such as the grenade expert ability of the soldier’s bombard fighting style).</p><p><strong>Damage:</strong> Most attacks underwater deal half damage (minimum 1 damage). However, melee attacks that deal piercing damage deal full damage, and any attacks that deal fire damage (including spells that deal fire damage) do one-quarter damage rather than half damage.</p><p><strong>Combat Maneuvers:</strong> The distance you move a target with a successful bull rush is reduced by 5 feet. The trip combat maneuver has no effect underwater.</p><p><strong>Burning Condition:</strong> Effects that would apply the burning condition (such as the burn critical hit effect) instead deal the damage listed for the condition only once (the normal underwater reduction for fire damage still applies; see Damage above), and the creature doesn’t receive the burning condition.</p><p><strong>Spells:</strong> Some spells work differently underwater, either as stated in their spell description or per the GM’s discretion. Spells with the fire descriptor often function differently when used underwater.</p><p><strong>Prone:</strong> Creatures swimming in water can drop prone only if they’re standing on the bottom of a body of water. If a creature underwater would be knocked prone by an effect, it instead gains the flat-footed condition and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. These effects last until the affected creature takes a move action to reorient itself.</p><p><strong>Stealth and Detection:</strong> It can be hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the seafloor). How far a character can see underwater depends on the water’s clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8 × 100 feet if the water is clear and 1d8 × 10 feet in murky water. Running water always counts as murky unless it’s in a particularly large, slow-moving river.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"6COC2LKEveQKUWSK","name":"Settlements","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2400000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 405</p><p>Any place where sentient life gathers, lives, and works on a regular basis is referred to as a settlement, and they are just as varied as the types of life-forms that occupy them.

The amenities of city living are usually made possible by technology, whether it’s cutting-edge devices or barely functioning older models. Technology is used in just about everything, from high-end security systems to simple signs and vending machines. Most technology found in settlements can be broken down into the following four categories.</p><h3>Civil</h3><p>Civil technology includes anything installed by a government to be part of an area’s infrastructure. Streetlights, public transportation, mail-delivery drones, automated street sweepers, and more make up this category of technology. As a great number of people usually rely on the services this kind of technology provides, it is often better protected. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of civil technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 23.</p><h3>Commercial</h3><p>Commercial technology is often mass-produced and is used by private citizens and most businesses. This category includes personal communication devices, game consoles, most security cameras and electronic door controls, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of commercial technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 18.</p><h3>Restricted</h3><p>Whether owned by the military or a massive corporation, restricted technology is some of the most advanced and hardest to hack. This category includes private servers, weapon prototypes, high-end security systems and alarms, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of restricted technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 30.</p><h3>Custom</h3><p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The pervasiveness of technology goes hand in hand with the ability to tweak and alter that technology. Engineers build custom refits for vehicles, and hackers jailbreak personal communication devices to do things the original creators never intended. Custom technology can be any piece of technology described above but with numerous modifications that make hacking or disabling it much trickier. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of custom technology with the Computers or Survival skill varies, but it might be as high as 40.</span></p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"pkHPhnLbWXWTx4V9","name":"Structures","type":"text","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Yv0sYlPqJmwLak2w.JournalEntryPage.pkHPhnLbWXWTx4V9"}},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":2500000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 406</p><p>The following rules cover the basic features that can be found in structures.</p><h2>Doors</h2><p>Doors in structures are much more than mere entrances and exits. They can even be encounters all by themselves. Doors come in several types. Consult Table 11–10: Doors for information on common types of doors.</p><ul><li><p>Breaking Doors: Structure doors might be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, artificially sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually break through a door with a large weapon such as an assault hammer or other heavy tool.<br /><br />Attempts to chop down a door with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and Hit Points given in Table 11–10: Doors. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines.<br /><br />DC 10 or Lower: A door just about anyone can break open.<br />DC 11–15: A door that a strong person could break with one try and that would take an average person one or two tries.<br />DC 16–20: A door that almost anyone could break, given enough time.<br />DC 21–25: A door that only a very strong person has any hope of breaking, and probably not on the first try.<br />DC 26 or Higher: A door that only an exceptionally strong person has any hope of breaking.</p></li><li><p>Locks: Structure doors are often locked and thus require the Engineering skill (or other means) to bypass. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle. Built-in locks (which are usually electronic) either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame or else a sliding iron or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built in but usually run through two rings: one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. A special door might have a lock needing a biometric signature or requiring that the right symbols be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open the door. Because such keyless locks are larger and more complex, they are typically found only in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or steel doors).<br /><br />The DC of the Computers check to hack an electronic system that controls a door or the Engineering check to pick a lock (whether it is mechanical or electronic) often ranges from 20 to 40, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately.<br /><br />Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to strike a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having a hardness of 20 and 30 Hit Points. A lock can be broken only if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied structure, every locked door should have a key somewhere.</p></li></ul><h2>Lighting</h2><p>Most fabricated structures have some form of lighting built into the ceilings or walls. This lighting provides enough illumination for the inhabitants to see and is often controlled via a simple switch, touch pad, or vocal device. Lighting can usually be turned on and off on a room-to-room basis, though sometimes a structure’s lighting can be deactivated via a central breaker switch (usually located in some kind of control room or service area). A typical manufactured lighting fixture has a break DC of 18, a hardness of 3, and 10 Hit Points (see page 409 for rules on smashing objects).</p><p>Natural caverns and structures built by and for creatures with darkvision often lack manufactured lighting. Characters without darkvision must provide their own source of lighting to be able to navigate these locations.</p><h2>Walls</h2><p>Structure walls vary drastically in makeup, ranging from natural, unworked solid stone to reinforced starship bulkheads (though stranger walls exist). While they are typically incredibly difficult to break down or through, they’re generally easy to climb. Table 11–9: Walls contains information on the most common types of walls found in structures.</p><ul><li>Concrete Walls: These walls are usually at least 1 foot thick. Concrete walls stop all but the loudest noises.</li><li>Starship Walls: Whether the interior walls or the bulkheads that form the outside of the ship, these walls are among the strongest.

Smashing an unattended object is similar, except this attack roll is opposed by the object’s Armor Class.</p><ul><li><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Unattended objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don’t usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object’s Armor Class is equal to 10 + a modifier due to its size (see Table 11–12: Size and Armor Class of Objects) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (–5 modifier) but also an additional –2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if a creature takes a full action to line up a shot, it automatically hits with a melee weapon and gains a +5 bonus to an attack roll with a ranged weapon.</li><li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Each object has hardness—a number that represents how well it resists damage. Each time an object is damaged, its hardness is subtracted from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object’s Hit Points. On average, a sturdy piece of equipment (such as a weapon or a suit of armor) has a hardness equal to 5 + 2 × its item level. Any other piece of equipment has a hardness equal to 5 + its item level.</li><li><p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> An object’s Hit Point total depends on its item level and is modified by additional criteria. On average, a sturdy piece of equipment (such as a weapon or a suit of armor) has a number of Hit Points equal to 15 + 3 × its item level. Any other piece of equipment has a number of Hit Points equal to 5 + its item level. Any item of level 15th or higher receives an extra 30 Hit Points. Very large objects may have separate Hit Point totals for different sections. Objects do not have Stamina Points.<br /><br />Damaged Objects: A damaged object remains functional (though it has the broken condition; see page 273) until the item’s Hit Points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed. Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Engineering skill or a number of spells.<br /><br />Ineffective Weapons: Certain weapons can’t effectively deal damage to certain objects. Most low-level melee weapons have little effect on metal walls and doors. Certain pieces of equipment are designed to cut through metal, however.<br /><br />Immunities: Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.<br /><br />Vulnerability to Certain Attacks: Certain attacks are especially strong against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and might ignore the object’s hardness.</p></li><li><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Effects that deal damage generally damage unattended objects normally but don’t damage held or attended objects unless the effect specifically says otherwise. Effects that do something other than deal damage affect only objects if their descriptions specifically say so (only common with spells) or note “(object)” in the description of the effect’s saving throw. An object’s total saving throw bonus for Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves is equal to the object’s caster level or item level. An object that is held or worn uses the saving throw bonus of the creature carrying it if that bonus is better than its own saving throw bonus. Items with a caster level or item level of 0 don’t receive saving throws when unattended.</li></ul><h2>Destroying Objects Using Strength</h2><p>When a character tries to destroy a certain object by using sudden force rather than by dealing damage, he attempts a Strength check (rather than making attack and damage rolls, as with the sunder combat maneuver) to determine whether he succeeds. Since hardness does not affect an object’s break DC, this value depends more on the construction of the item in question than on the material the object is made of. Consult Table 11–13: DCs to Break Objects for a list of common break DCs.</p><p>If an object has lost half or more of its Hit Points, the object gains the broken condition (see page 273) and the DC to break it is reduced by 2.</p><p>Larger and smaller creatures get bonuses and penalties to Strength checks to break objects as follows: Fine –16, Diminutive –12, Tiny –8, Small –4, Large +4, Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16.</p><h2>Table 11-12: Size and Armor Class of Objects</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Size</th><th>AC Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>–8</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>–4</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>–1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Fine</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Table 11-13: DCs to Break Objects</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Task</th><th>Strength DC</th></tr><tr><td>Break down wooden door</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Burst rope bonds</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Burst steel restraints</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Break down steel door</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Bend nanocarbon bars</td><td>35</td></tr></tbody></table>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

There are five types of actions: standard actions, move actions, swift actions, full actions, and reactions.</p><p>In a normal round, you can perform one standard action, one move action, and one swift action, or you can instead perform one full action. Most characters will rarely perform swift actions, though occasionally using a special ability or class feature is a swift action.

Below are examples of standard actions.</p><h2>Activate an Item</h2><p>Many technological and magic items, such as a cybernetic arm, don’t need to be activated. Certain items, however, do need to be activated to have an effect. Unless otherwise noted, activating such an item is a standard action.</p><h2>Attack</h2><p>Making a single attack is a standard action.</p><h3>Melee Attacks</h3><p>With a melee weapon, you can strike any opponent in a square adjacent to your space. You add your Strength modifier to your melee attack rolls and to your melee damage rolls.</p><p>Some melee weapons in Chapter 7 have the reach special property, as indicated in their descriptions, and some monsters have natural reach. Typically, a character or monster with reach can attack any foe within their reach (see Reach and Threatened Squares on page 255 for more details).</p><h3>Ranged Attacks</h3><p>With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or otherwise attack a target that is within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect (see page 271). You add your Dexterity modifier to your ranged attack rolls, but not to your ranged damage rolls.</p><h3>Ranged Attacks with a Thrown Weapon</h3><p>With a thrown weapon or a grenade, you can make a ranged attack at a target that is within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect (see page 271). You add your Strength modifier to your ranged attack rolls with a thrown weapon, and to your damage rolls with weapons with the thrown special property. Do not add your Strength modifier to damage rolls with grenades.</p><h3>Targeting a Grid Intersection</h3><p>When using a weapon with the explode special property or a thrown weapon that has an area effect, such as a grenade, you target a specific grid intersection on a tactical battle map, rather than a specific creature. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5.</p><h3>Missing with a Thrown Weapon</h3><p>If you miss on a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, the weapon lands in a random square or grid intersection as appropriate near your target. To determine where it lands, roll 1d8. This determines the initial misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction, as illustrated in the diagram above. After you’ve determined the misdirection of the throw, roll 1d4. The result is how many squares away in that direction the weapon lands.</p><p>For example, after a missed ranged attack with a grenade, a player rolls 1d8 with a result of 1. This indicates that the grenade’s initial misdirection falls short of the target intersection. Then, the player rolls 1d4 with a result of 2. This determines that the grenade actually lands at an intersection 2 squares in front of the target intersection.</p><h3>Range and Penalties</h3><p>A ranged weapon’s range increment is listed along with its other statistics (see Chapter 7). If you make an attack with a ranged weapon from a distance greater than its listed range, you take a cumulative –2 penalty to the attack roll for each full range increment of distance between you and the target beyond the first (or fraction thereof).</p><p>For most ranged weapons, the maximum range is 10 range increments, or 10× the number listed as the weapon’s range. For thrown weapons, the maximum range is 5 range increments. Some ranged weapons have different maximum ranges, but if so, their descriptions specify their maximum ranges.</p><h3>Critical Hits</h3><p>When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20), you hit regardless of your target’s AC. If the total result of your attack roll meets or exceeds the target’s EAC or KAC (as appropriate for your attack), you’ve also scored a critical hit. You roll your damage twice, each time with all your usual bonuses and including any additional damage from special abilities, and then add the rolls together. Some weapons inflict a special effect on a target of a critical hit, in addition to dealing double damage (see page 182).</p><p>If the total result of your attack is less than your target’s relevant AC, your attack still hits on a natural 20, but it deals damage normally.</p><h2>Cast a Spell</h2><p>The vast majority of spells require at least a standard action to cast, and sometimes more. Spells that take more than a round to cast require a full action each round until they are complete. For more information about how spells and magic work, see Chapter 10.</p><h3>Casting While Threatened</h3><p>Casting a spell takes a significant amount of concentration, forcing you to lower your defenses briefly. When you cast a spell, it gives targets threatening you in melee a chance to make an attack of opportunity against you (see Attack of Opportunity on page 248), unless the spell specifies otherwise—normally only the case for a few spells with a range of touch. If this attack of opportunity hits and damages you, you fail to cast the spell and lose the spell slot. For more information about threatened squares, see page 255.</p><h2>Combat Maneuver</h2><p>As a standard action, you can attempt one of the following combat maneuvers. For each maneuver, choose an opponent within your reach (including your weapon’s reach, if applicable) and then make a melee attack roll against the opponent’s KAC + 8. The effects of success vary depending on the maneuver, as described below.</p><h3>Bull Rush</h3><p>You knock the target back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8. If an obstacle is in the way, the target stops at the obstacle instead.</p><h3>Dirty Trick</h3><p>You make an unorthodox attack to briefly hinder the target. A dirty trick could be throwing sand in the target’s eyes, jamming a rock into his actuators, or any other improvised action designed to put your opponent at a disadvantage. Your target is blinded, deafened, entangled, off-target, shaken, or sickened (your choice) for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8 (see Conditions beginning on page 273 for information on these conditions). The target can remove the condition as a move action. A dirty trick is normally a melee attack, but a GM can allow certain actions to count as dirty tricks at range, in which case you take a –2 penalty to your attack roll for every 5 feet between you and the target.</p><h3>Disarm</h3><p>You knock an item the target is holding out of the target’s hands and onto the ground. If you have a hand free, you can automatically grab the item with your hand before it falls.</p><h3>Grapple</h3><p>You hold the target in place. You must have at least one hand free to perform a grapple combat maneuver. Your target has the grappled condition, meaning she can’t move from her current space and takes further penalties until she either uses a standard action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver to grapple you (giving you the grappled condition) or uses the escape task of the Acrobatics skill to break free. If the result of your attack roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 13, the target is instead pinned for the same duration, and she can’t take any actions that involve moving her limbs other than to attempt to escape.</p><p>The grappled or pinned condition lasts until the end of your next turn, unless you renew it on your next turn with another grapple combat maneuver. The condition ends immediately if you move away. As long as you have one target grappled or pinned, you cannot attempt to grapple another. The grappled and pinned conditions are further detailed in Conditions on pages 276–277.</p><p>When you renew a grapple, you can remove one item from the target’s body that can be easily accessed, including most weapons and equipment (but not worn armor). Doing so immediately ends the grapple.</p><h3>Reposition</h3><p>You change the target’s position to a different location still within your reach and within 5 feet of its original placement. You can move the target 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8, but all movement must remain within your reach. You cannot move the target past an obstacle.<br /><br />If you reposition a creature as a full action, you can move a distance equal to the distance you repositioned your target (up to your move speed), dragging the target along with you.</p><h3>Sunder</h3><p>You deal damage to one object held in the target’s hand or accessible on its body. The object must be something that could be drawn easily by the target as a move action (see Draw or Sheathe a Weapon on page 247). The damage is reduced by an amount equal to the object’s hardness (see Smashing an Object page 409).</p><h3>Trip</h3><p>You knock the target prone if it is on the ground. A target in the air instead descends 10 feet, falling prone if this causes it to fall to the ground. A target in zero gravity is instead knocked offkilter. The prone and off-kilter conditions are further detailed on pages 276–277.</p><h2>Concentrate to Maintain a Spell</h2><p>Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action (see Duration on page 270 for more information about concentration).</p><h3>Covering Fire</h3><p>You can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that provides covering fire for an ally. Make a ranged attack roll against AC 15. If you hit, you deal no damage but the selected ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the next attack from a creature in your line of effect (see page 271), so long as that attack occurs before your next turn.</p><h2>Dismiss a Spell</h2><p>Dismissing an active spell is a standard action (see Duration on page 270 for more information about dismissible spells).</p><h2>Feint</h2><p>You can use your standard action to feint by attempting a Bluff check. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s Sense Motive total skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. You can’t feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score, and you cannot take 10 or take 20 (see page 133 in Chapter 5) on a Bluff check to feint. When you successfully feint, you treat your opponent as flat-footed for your next attack against him before the end of your next turn.</p><h2>Fight Defensively</h2><p>You can fight defensively when attacking as part of a standard action. If you do, you take a –4 penalty to attacks and gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Harrying Fire</h2><p>You can use your standard action to make a ranged attack that distracts a foe in your line of effect. Make an attack roll against AC 15. If you hit, you deal no damage, but the next ally to attack that foe gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her next attack roll, as long as that attack occurs before your next turn.</p><h2>Total Defense</h2><p>You can defend yourself as a standard action. Starting at the beginning of this action, you get a +4 bonus to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn. You can’t combine total defense with other actions that increase your AC, nor can you make attacks of opportunity while benefiting from total defense.</p><h2>Use a Special Ability</h2><p>There are three types of special abilities: extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural. Special abilities often carry the parenthetical abbreviations (Ex), (Sp), or (Su) to indicate whether they are extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural abilities. Some are ongoing, while others are use-activated. For more details, including descriptions of specific special abilities, see page 262.</p><p>Using a special ability is usually a standard action, unless it is an ongoing ability or the ability says otherwise. In rare cases, an ability might take a full action or a move action to activate. In most cases, a use-activated special ability cannot be activated as a swift action. Using a spell-like ability typically provokes attacks of opportunity (see page 248) unless stated otherwise.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"SKgwxeMd2gB1g2W8","name":"Move Actions","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 247</p><p>Most move actions don’t require a check unless the circumstances are more difficult than normal.

A crawling character is considered prone.</p><h2>Direct or Redirect an Effect</h2><p>Some technology and spells allow you to redirect an effect to new targets or areas. Redirecting requires a move action unless the technology or spell states otherwise.</p><h2>Draw or Sheathe a Weapon</h2><p>Drawing a weapon so that you can use it in combat or putting it away so that you have a free hand requires a move action. This action includes activating or deactivating the weapon. This also applies to weapon-like objects that are easily accessible, such as remote controls and most tools or sensors you can carry and use with one hand.

This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a door.</p><h2>Move Your Speed</h2><p>The simplest move action is moving up to your speed (see Speed on page 255 for more information). Many nonstandard modes of movement are also covered under this action, including burrowing (using your natural burrow speed, if you have one), climbing and swimming (using either the Athletics skill or your natural climb or swim speed, if you have one), or flying (using the Acrobatics skill if you have either access to flight or a natural fly speed). See Additional Movement Types on page 258 for more details. Some full actions (such as the operative’s trick attack) allow you to move as well, which act as moving up to your speed.</p><h2>Reload</h2><p>Unless stated otherwise, reloading is a move action that includes grabbing ammunition you have readily available. Some weapons require different actions to reload; see the weapon’s description.</p><h2>Stand Up</h2><p>This special form of move action allows you to stand up from a prone position.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"z8FNl9fShmFH8est","name":"Swift Actions","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":400000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 247</p><p>You won’t commonly use a swift action, but occasionally you need to perform an action that is significantly less demanding than a move action.

If you take a full action, you can’t take your usual standard, move, and swift actions. The following actions are full actions.</p><h2>Charge</h2><p>Charging is a full action that allows you to move up to double your speed and make a melee attack at the end of the movement. You can draw a weapon during a charge attack if your base attack bonus is at least +1.</p><p>Charging carries tight restrictions on how you can move. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares), and all movement must be directly toward the designated opponent, though diagonal movement is allowed. You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and you must move to the space closest to your starting square from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or blocked, you can’t charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement (such as difficult terrain), or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. You can still move through helpless creatures during a charge. If you don’t have line of sight (see page 271) to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.</p><p>Attacking on a Charge: After moving, you can make a single melee attack. You take a –2 penalty to the attack roll and a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. You can’t move any farther after the attack. Some classes, including solarian and soldier, grant abilities that modify attacks made on charges.</p><h2>Coup de Grace</h2><p>As a full action, you can deliver a special attack called a coup de grace to an adjacent helpless opponent. You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the target survives the damage, he must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your level or CR) or die. However, if the target is immune to critical hits, the coup de grace does not deal critical damage or effects, nor does it force the target to succeed at a saving throw or die.</p><h2>Fight Defensively</h2><p>You can fight defensively when attacking as a full action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty to all attacks in that round (in addition to the normal penalties for making a full attack) to gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Full Attack</h2><p>You can spend a full action to make two attacks, each with a –4 penalty to the attack rolls. These attacks can be made with the same weapon or different weapons, though certain weapons have a firing speed so slow that you can’t shoot them more than once in a round, even with a full attack. These weapons have the unwieldy special property (see page 182).</p><p>Certain weapons have special individualized full attacks. For instance, some weapons have a fully automatic attack mode. Sometimes special full attacks, such as the soldier’s onslaught class feature, require specialized training in order to gain their benefits.</p><h2>Run</h2><p>You can run as a full action. When you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight line. You gain the flat-footed condition, and you can’t run if you must cross difficult terrain or can’t see where you’re going. Running provokes attacks of opportunity (see below). You can run for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score. See page 258 for information on long-distance running.</p><h2>Withdraw</h2><p>Withdrawing from melee combat is a full action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies don’t get to make attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that square. Unseen enemies still get attacks of opportunity against you, and you can’t withdraw from combat if you’re blinded and have no other precise senses (such as blindsight). If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square other than the one you in which started, enemies can make attacks of opportunity as normal. See Attack of Opportunity below for more information.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"GtSmojwt4d6rdEkm","name":"Reactions","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":600000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 248</p><p>A reaction is a special action you can take even if it’s not your turn, but only after a defined and concrete trigger.

Thus, you can speak an amount that makes sense, at the GM’s discretion, without spending any of your actions, even if it isn’t your turn.</p><h2>Delay</h2><p>If you aren’t sure what to do when it’s your turn, you can delay taking an action until other characters have taken their turns. You must declare that you are delaying before taking any actions on your turn (this does not require spending any of your actions). After any creature takes its turn in the initiative order, you can come out of delay and take your turn. This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of the combat.

Decide on a standard, move, or swift action and a trigger. You can take the action you chose when the trigger happens. This changes your initiative count to the current initiative count for the remainder of the combat. If you used a reaction on your previous turn and then chose to ready an action, you still regain your reaction at the beginning of your original turn, not when you take your readied action.</p><p>If your readied action is purely defensive, such as choosing the total defense action if a foe you are facing shoots at you, it occurs just before the event that triggered it.

If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again).</p><h2>Use a Skill</h2><p>Like using skills in different circumstances, using a skill in combat usually (but not always) requires taking an action. The action required when using a skill depends on the skill and the specific task you’re trying to accomplish.

Whether you are skimming through space aboard a mercenary vessel, attending a diplomatic meeting on a space station, or descending to a planet’s surface to explore, armor provides you with protection against attacks and hostile environments.</p><p>Modern armor is made of many different substances, including carbon fiber, ceramic, fabric, metal, and polymers. Most are constructed from a combination of materials, and some even use archaic materials such as animal hide. Creatures wear armor to protect themselves, but also to express their personal style.</p><p>Most suits of armor consist of a helmet, gloves, boots, and a bodysuit that offers head-to-toe protection. Unless otherwise specified, the boots include a functionality that can anchor your feet to a solid surface in a zero-gravity environment, allowing you to orient yourself or return to normal footing when needed (for more about moving in @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#zero-gravity]{zero-g}, see page 402).</p><h1>Reading Armor Tables</h1><p>Each entry on the armor tables starting on page 197 describes a single suit of armor, with the following statistics.</p><ul><li><strong>Level:</strong> The armor’s item level (see page 167).</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> This is the price in credits of the suit of armor.</li><li><strong>EAC Bonus:</strong> This is the bonus your armor adds to your Energy Armor Class, which protects against attacks from laser weapons, plasma cannons, and the like (see page 240).</li><li><strong>KAC Bonus:</strong> This is the bonus your armor adds to your Kinetic Armor Class, which protects against projectiles, most melee weapons, and other solid objects (see page 240).</li><li><strong>Maximum Dex Bonus:</strong> You normally add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class (for both EAC and KAC), but it’s limited by your armor. Your armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus indicates how much of your Dexterity modifier you can add to AC. Any excess Dexterity doesn’t raise your AC further and is simply ignored for this purpose.</li><li><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> You take a penalty to most Strengthand Dexterity-based skill checks equal to this number. See Chapter 5 for a more complete list of which skills apply.</li><li><strong>Speed Adjustment:</strong> While wearing the armor, your speed is adjusted by this number.</li><li><strong>Upgrade Slots:</strong> You can improve your armor with magic and technological upgrades. This entry shows how many total upgrades your armor can accommodate. Some armor upgrades are larger or more complicated and take up multiple upgrade slots (see page 204.)</li><li><strong>Bulk:</strong> This is the bulk of the item (see page 167).</li></ul><h1>Wearing Armor</h1><p>A character’s class and feats determine what kinds of armor they can wear. Further details about wearing armor are below.</p><h2>Armor Proficiency</h2><p>If you are wearing armor with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty to both EAC and KAC (see page 240). A character who is proficient only with light armor can wear heavier armor effectively by selecting the Heavy Armor Proficiency feat.</p><h2>Donning Armor</h2><p>The time required to don or remove armor depends on its type. Light armor requires 4 rounds to don or remove, while heavy armor requires 16 rounds to don or remove.</p><p>Armor that is at least 8th level but less than 16th level takes half the normal time to don or remove. Armor of 16th level or higher takes one-quarter the normal time to don or remove, to a minimum of one full action.</p><p>Modern suits of armor are designed so that you can don or remove armor without assistance.</p><h2>Don Hastily</h2><p>You can hastily don armor in half the normal time, to a minimum of one full action. The armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 worse than normal.</p><h1>Armor Size</h1><p>Armor comes in different sizes for different creatures, and you might have to adjust a suit of armor to fit you if it wasn’t made for your race. A ysoki can’t effectively wear armor made for a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}, and a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} needs to adjust armor that was made for a two-armed creature. If it’s in doubt whether a creature can fit the suit, the GM decides whether the armor needs to be adjusted. When you buy armor new, the purchase price includes any adjustments.</p><h2>Adjusting Armor</h2><p>If you get secondhand armor that wasn’t tailored for you, you can have it adjusted, which requires a successful Engineering check (DC = 10 + 2 × the armor’s level). Alternatively, you can spend 10% of the armor’s purchase price to have it adjusted by a professional—typically an armorsmith or anyone with multiple ranks in Engineering.</p><h1>Environmental Protections</h1><p>Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all armors protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor force field specially attuned to pressure and temperature that does not reduce damage from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals. The most common environmental dangers are detailed in Environment beginning on page 394.</p><h2>Activation and Duration</h2><p>A suit of armor’s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to its item level. Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes a standard action if you are wearing the suit (assuming the armor was properly donned). If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a helpless creature, you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action, but turning it off requires a Computers check to hack the system, treating the suit as a computer with a tier equal to half the suit’s item level (the base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier).</p><p>The duration of a suit’s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an environment recharging station (publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SNa3WLH4kUYJP3I9.JournalEntryPage.m2QaMoUIFmUHppEC#recharging-stations]{recharging stations} that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells (see page 234), also recharge armor’s environmental protections, and using them to recharge suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no duration remaining still work normally.</p><h2>Breathing and Pressure</h2><p>All armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres (including any airborne poison or disease). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.NOrSFYXShdxot60k#corrosive]{corrosive atmosphere} (see page 395) to prevent suffocation, but it isn’t strong enough to prevent a corrosive atmosphere from dealing acid damage to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid damage taken from a corrosive atmosphere normally. Any vision impairment from the environment (such as smoke or water) still applies.</p><h2>Radiation</h2><p>Armor protects you against low levels of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#radiation]{radiation} (see page 403) and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. Armor of 7th level and higher grants immunity to medium radiation levels and provides a +6 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. No armor’s bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that caused you to contract it.</p><h2>Temperature</h2><p>Armor’s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#cold-dangers]{cold} (temperatures as low as –20° F) and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#heat-dangers]{heat} (temperatures as high as 140° F). This prevents you from having to attempt most Fortitude saving throws to avoid damage from the environment, and it prevents you from taking damage from breathing in most environments. This does not protect against cold or fire damage from other sources or against environments that deal damage without allowing a Fortitude saving throw or breathing the atmosphere (such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#lava-effects]{lava}).)</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"CiNKKlR4u8oZjOoP","name":"Powered Armor","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 203</p><p>Unlike light and heavy armor, powered armor requires its own battery, and comes with a fully charged battery at purchase.

More about using powered armor is below.</p><h3>Entering and Exiting</h3><p>Getting into or exiting a suit of powered armor requires a full action. Unless noted otherwise, a suit of powered armor has an electronic lock preventing anyone from opening it without knowing the passcode. The passcode can be determined with a successful @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.IqOCYDKd9NgBwowp]{Computers} check (DC = 15 + double the armor’s level).</p><h3>Powered Armor Proficiency</h3><p>Characters can gain proficiency with powered armor by taking the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.XFUghykvnCSVHJ9n]{Powered Armor Proficiency} feat (see page 160) or at 5th level through the soldier’s guard fighting style. Lacking proficiency in powered armor comes with more significant drawbacks than with other types of armor. If you are wearing powered armor with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty to both EAC and KAC, you are always flat-footed and off-target, and you move at half speed. If the armor has a special form of movement (such as a fly speed), you cannot use that movement.</p><h1>Powered Armor Descriptions</h1><p>The following explains powered armor’s statistics entries. Specific suits of powered armor are described on page 204. Each suit of powered armor’s price is listed in Table 7–16: Powered Armor.</p><h2>EAC and KAC Bonuses</h2><p>These are the bonuses the powered armor adds to your Energy Armor Class, which protects against attacks from laser weapons and the like, and to your Kinetic Armor Class, which protects against projectiles and other solid objects.</p><p>The cockpit of powered armor is too small to fit a person wearing heavy armor. If you’re wearing light armor while in powered armor, you gain the higher of the EAC bonuses and the higher of the KAC bonuses between the two suits of armor, and you take the worse maximum Dexterity bonus and armor check penalty. Powered armor is normally designed to be operated by any roughly humanoid creature of Small or Medium size—only creatures not matching those criteria must have the armor tailored to fit them (see Adjusting Armor on page 196).</p><h2>Maximum Dexterity Bonus</h2><p>You normally add your Dexterity modifier to your EAC and KAC, but it’s limited by your powered armor. A suit of powered armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus indicates how much of your Dexterity modifier you can add to your AC. Any excess Dexterity bonus doesn’t raise your AC further.</p><h2>Armor Check Penalty</h2><p>You take a penalty to most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks equal to this number.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>Rather than using your normal speed, the powered armor has a maximum land speed of its own. In some cases, powered armor has additional movement types as well.</p><h2>Strength</h2><p>When wearing powered armor, the armor determines your effective Strength. You use it for all Strength-based rolls. Even if your Strength is higher, you’re limited to the armor’s Strength.</p><h2>Damage</h2><p>When you make an unarmed melee attack with the powered armor, it deals damage equal to the armor’s listed damage value plus its Strength modifier.</p><p>The special unarmed strike made with powered armor does not count as archaic and can be improved by the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.A character with multiple unarmed strikes can choose which to use, though note that Large or larger powered armor requires the use of all of a character’s hands, and that may restrict some characters to certain unarmed strikes.</p><h2>Size</h2><p>A suit of powered armor has the listed size, so you may take up more space when you’re wearing it.</p><p>Some suits of powered armor list a reach in parentheses after size. Powered armor with a reach greater than 5 feet allows you to attack creatures within that range in melee even if they aren’t adjacent to you. Add the reach of the powered armor to the reach of any weapons you wield using the powered armor.</p><h2>Capacity and Usage</h2><p>Powered armor requires a great deal of electricity to function, and it has a battery capacity and usage value.</p><p>A suit of powered armor’s battery capacity indicates the number of charges its battery holds. This battery can be recharged as normal using a generator or a recharging station (see page 234), or it can be replaced with a new battery (see Table 7–9: Ammunition). You can put a battery with a smaller charge capacity into powered armor, but you can’t recharge one to hold more than its maximum number of charges.</p><p>Powered armor’s usage indicates how long a single battery charge runs the armor. For example, a character in a battle harness with a fully charged battery can use that powered armor for 20 hours before its battery needs to be replaced or recharged. Once you have entered a suit of powered armor, you can tell how many battery charges it has remaining, if any. You can turn a suit of powered armor on or off as a standard action, and you do not need to use all charges for a suit of powered armor consecutively, but you must use them in 1-charge increments.</p><p>If you’re in armor that’s out of power, you are flat-footed and off-target, you don’t benefit from the armor’s Strength or damage, and you can’t attack with it or cause it to move. None of its mounted weapons (see below) or upgrades (see Armor Upgrades below) function, even if they have their own power sources. You can’t attempt any Strength- or Dexterity-based skill checks, and the armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus is +0 (or the armor’s regular maximum Dexterity bonus, if lower). You can still exit the armor.</p><h2>Weapon Slots</h2><p>Ranged weapons can be installed in most powered armor. The maximum number is equal to the powered armor’s weapon slots.</p><h2>Upgrade Slots</h2><p>You can improve your powered armor with technological and magical upgrades (see below). This entry shows how many total upgrades your powered armor can accommodate. Some larger or more complicated upgrades take up multiple upgrade slots.</p><h2>Bulk</h2><p>A powered armor’s listed bulk refers to its bulk when it is picked up or carried as cargo, and it does not count toward your own normal carrying capacity. When you’re wearing powered armor, you use that armor’s Strength to determine your carrying capacity. Count everything you’re wearing, everything the powered armor is holding, and any armor upgrades and weapons mounted to the powered armor against this bulk limit.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"D0bQCbMD3nccYvBV","name":"Armor Upgrades","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":200000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>CRB pg. 204</p><p>A creature can personalize armor by purchasing and installing armor upgrades, described below, which add bonuses or customized abilities to armor. Some individuals keep a collection of upgrades at hand, swapping them out as needed (requiring 10 minutes to replace the unit and resecure all connections). Explanations of entries for upgrades’ statistics follow.</p><h2>Capacity</h2><p>For a technological armor upgrade that requires charges to function, this entry lists the maximum size battery the upgrade can hold. The batteries that upgrades hold can be recharged as normal using either a generator or a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SNa3WLH4kUYJP3I9.JournalEntryPage.m2QaMoUIFmUHppEC#recharging-stations]{recharging station} (see page 234). A magic armor upgrade that can be used a certain number of times runs on magical charges; these charges are integral to the construction of the item and can’t be replenished with generators or batteries. Charges for a magic item either refresh each day or never refresh.</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>This entry lists how many charges are consumed when the armor upgrade is used. This might be per activation or a certain duration. If an armor upgrade uses a certain number of charges over an interval, the upgrade’s abilities can be shut off before that amount of time has passed, but it still uses charges for the full interval. For instance, an upgrade that uses charges at a rate of 2 per round would still use 2 charges if activated for half a round.</p><h2>Upgrade Slots</h2><p>Each suit of armor contains a certain number of upgrade slots. This represents the maximum number of times the armor can be modified while still functioning. If you install upgrades beyond the maximum, the armor and all upgrades attached to it cease to function until you remove enough upgrades to bring the armor down to its maximum number of upgrade slots or fewer.</p><p>Some upgrades use more than one upgrade slot, as noted in the Armor Slots entry in Table 7–17: Armor Upgrades.</p><h2>Magic Upgrades</h2><p>Some armor upgrades are magic or a hybrid of magic and technology.

If you delay your action, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled and continues to act on the same initiative count as it did before. This separates your initiative count from that of the vehicle, and the vehicle continues to move (see below) at your previous initiative count until a pilot takes control of it or it crashes or otherwise is brought to a definitive halt.<br /><br />Unless otherwise specified, an uncontrolled vehicle moves straight ahead at its most recent heading as if taking two drive actions on its turn. It slows down incrementally with each action taken (usually to three-quarters the speed of its last action) until it comes to a stop or crashes. At the GM’s discretion, it could slow down more if it’s on uneven terrain or an upward slope, or it could stay at the same speed or even accelerate if it’s in a zero-g environment or on a downward slope.</p><p> </p><h2>Taking Control</h2><p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action (see Take Control on page 278). During this move action, the vehicle doesn’t move any additional distance—you spend the whole action taking control. Once the action is taken, the vehicle resets to your initiative count, and you can spend any remaining actions piloting the vehicle.</p><p> </p><h2>Crashing</h2><p>If an uncontrolled vehicle runs into an obstacle or another vehicle, it crashes. This deals double the vehicle’s collision damage to the uncontrolled vehicle and to the obstacle it ran into, and stops the uncontrolled vehicle’s progress. If the uncontrolled vehicle crashes into a controlled vehicle, the other pilot can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit as if it were being rammed (see Ram on page 279). If that pilot avoids being hit, the uncontrolled vehicle continues to move as detailed in Uncontrolled Vehicles above.</p><p> </p><h1>Autocontrol</h1><p>Some vehicles have autocontrol, which enables you to spend your actions on tasks other than piloting, but is far less capable than an autopilot. You can engage autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action, and it lasts until it is disengaged (also a swift action) or until the vehicle is no longer capable of moving. When you’re using autocontrol, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled, but each round it moves in a straight line for the same distance and at the same heading and speed as the last pilot action (moving as if taking two drive actions if drive was the last action the pilot took, or as a race action if that was the last action the pilot took). The autocontrol uses the result of the pilot’s most recent Piloting check as the result of its Piloting checks.</p><p> </p><h1>Autopilot</h1><p>Some vehicles have an autopilot AI that can control the vehicle in place of an actual pilot. You can engage or disengage an autopilot as a swift action. You can input a destination into an autopilot as a move action, and the autopilot attempts to reach that location if doing so is possible (provided the autopilot isn’t locked by a passcode or otherwise programmed not to obey).<br /><br />A vehicle is considered controlled when the autopilot is engaged. An autopilot’s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br /><br />The Systems entry in a vehicle’s statistics (see page 228) lists the autopilot’s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle’s modifier (listed in the vehicle’s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</p><p> </p><h1>Attacking from a Vehicle</h1><p>Anyone attacking while on a vehicle takes that vehicle’s penalty to attack rolls, as listed in the Modifiers entry of the vehicle’s statistics (see page 228). It’s especially difficult to attack from a vehicle that’s moving at high speed, so a vehicle might have a higher modifier on attacks (shown in parentheses) when traveling at full speed. The penalty for moving at full speed applies if the vehicle moved at full speed during the last round. The attack penalty doesn’t apply when the vehicle is stopped.</p><p> </p><h2>Firing Vehicle Weapons</h2><p>Firing a weapon mounted on a vehicle works like firing a normal ranged weapon, but you must activate the vehicle’s weapons instead of ones you hold. The penalties to attack rolls in the vehicle’s Modifiers entry also apply to attacks made with a vehicle’s weapons.<br /><br />Some vehicles have weapons bound to their steering devices or weapons that are operated from the same control panel. These can be fired when you are piloting, though you normally can’t fire the vehicle’s weapons on the same turn that you race (or on the same turn that you take another full action) because you don’t have enough available actions. Weapons mounted in other manners typically need to be fired by creatures on the vehicle that are dedicated gunners.</p><p> </p><h2>Drive-By Attacks</h2><p>Because many vehicles have full speeds that might let them move across an entire battle map, the GM may need to make a judgment call when vehicles leave the map and want to return. The GM determines how long returning takes, but it normally takes at least 1 round to double back, since it takes a move action to drive and change heading.<br /><br />In theory, creatures could pile on a vehicle, ready actions to shoot enemies as soon as they’re within 30 feet, race the vehicle across the map, and fire in passing. Such a maneuver might seem like a sure thing, but it comes with a few problems. First, the attackers take a big penalty to all their attacks, but enemies who ready actions to fire back don’t take those penalties. Second, enemies have time to prepare while the vehicle is off the map. They might take cover, set up obstacles to prevent the vehicle from racing through, or just leave. The GM might also rule that the attackers can’t keep a good watch on what’s happening while they’re off the map or that the vehicle breaks down after the stress of using such a tactic.</p><p> </p><h1>Escaping on a Vehicle</h1><p>Because vehicles have a top speed that’s far faster than most creatures can run, creatures in a vehicle can usually escape from a battle with enemies who are on foot, if they want. The GM has final say on whether a vehicle can escape. Usually, once a vehicle is beyond the range that the enemies on foot can run, those enemies get one more volley of attacks, and then the vehicle and everyone on it escapes. However, if the enemies also board a vehicle, they can usually pursue and the battle transitions to a vehicle chase (see page 282).</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"xOim5yfmNd81gvam","name":"Vehicle Heading","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":100000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB  pg. 278</p><p>Which direction creatures are facing on a grid is generally irrelevant in Starfinder, but vehicles aren’t as nimble, so you need to monitor a vehicle’s heading each time it moves.

Creatures can take the following actions to drive or interact with vehicles, in addition to the normal combat actions described earlier in this chapter.</p><h2>Move Actions</h2><p>It takes a move action to board, drive, start, abruptly stop, or take control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p><h3>Board or Disembark from a Vehicle</h3><p>You can board or disembark from a vehicle as a move action. Doing so while the vehicle is in motion requires a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check; see Boarding on page 285.</p><h3>Drive</h3><p>You can pilot a vehicle at its drive speed, which is noted in the Speed entry of the vehicle’s statistics (see page 228) as a move action. You can turn as needed throughout that movement, and you set your heading at the end of the drive action.</p><p>Vehicles provoke attacks of opportunity while driving, and when you are in a vehicle that’s driving, you similarly provoke attacks of opportunity if you take any actions that would normally do so (including making ranged attacks) unless the vehicle provides total cover. You can’t use the drive action to move a vehicle through spaces occupied by creatures, even if they’re allies.</p><h3>Start Vehicle</h3><p>Firing the ignition of a vehicle is typically a move action, though more complicated vehicles might have a multistage startup sequence requiring multiple actions.</p><h3>Stop Short</h3><p>Stopping a vehicle after a race action (see Race below) requires a move action (stopping after a drive action doesn’t require an action; see Not an Action on page 280). Normally, a vehicle continues to move following a race action. You can attempt a Piloting check (see Pilot a Vehicle on page 146) to reduce the distance your vehicle moves before stopping after a race action by the result of your check, rounded down to the next 5-foot increment. For example, with a result of 17 you would reduce the distance moved by 15 feet (3 squares).</p><h3>Take Control</h3><p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action. See Uncontrolled Vehicles on page 280 for more information about taking control of an uncontrolled vehicle.</p><h2>Full Actions</h2><p>Speed along in a straight line or attacking with the body of a vehicle takes a full action, as detailed below.</p><h3>Race</h3><p>When making a race action, you pilot a vehicle at full speed in a straight line at its current heading using a full action. You must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + your vehicle’s item level) to race. If your vehicle is starting from a dead stop (that is, it didn’t move last round), the DC of the check increases by 5.</p><p>If you fail this Piloting check, the vehicle’s behavior depends on the circumstances of the check and the surrounding terrain. If you were attempting to race from a dead stop, the vehicle stalls and doesn’t move at all. If the vehicle was already moving, its behavior depends on the terrain. Rough terrain slows the vehicle, causing it to move at half its full speed at its current heading. On flat terrain, the vehicle usually moves at full speed but goes significantly off course. In this case, the GM should take the 180-degree arc in front of the vehicle and divide it into four equal 45-degree arcs. Then the GM randomly determines which of these arcs the vehicle moves into.</p><p>A vehicle can’t safely race through difficult terrain or over obstacles unless outfitted with special gear, nor can it safely race to a destination you can’t see unless you’ve thoroughly scanned the destination. If you force a vehicle to race unsafely, you must attempt a Piloting check at a DC determined by the GM (usually 20 + the vehicle’s item level) when you encounter the difficult terrain or obstacle. If you fail or the vehicle is uncontrolled (see page 280), the vehicle crashes or spins out, as determined by the GM.</p><p>After taking a race action, a vehicle doesn’t slow down immediately. On your next turn, you have four options: you can use another full action to continue to race at full speed, use a move action to drive at the vehicle’s drive speed, use a move action to stop short, or relinquish control of the vehicle as a swift action. If you take a swift or move action, you can also take a standard action during that turn. For instance, you could race one turn, then on your next turn, you could fire a weapon as a standard action and then drive as your move action.</p><p>A racing vehicle provokes attacks of opportunity, but it gets a +2 bonus to its AC against them due to its speed.</p><p>Many vehicles have extremely high full speeds compared to creatures’ speeds, so racing at full speed is often tantamount to exiting a battle entirely, unless other vehicles get involved.</p><h3>Ram</h3><p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to its full speed in a straight line at its current heading and try to ram one creature or object at the end of the movement, dealing double the vehicle’s collision damage to the target and half the vehicle’s collision damage to your vehicle. A vehicle’s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see page 228).</p><p>Movement during a ram action has all the same restrictions as the race action and requires the same Piloting checks. If you fail any Piloting check during the movement, you fail to ram your target.</p><p>If the target of the ram action is a creature, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the vehicle’s collision DC to avoid being hit. If the target of the ram action is another vehicle, the pilot of the defending vehicle can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit, with a DC equal to the result of your Piloting check. The attacker wins ties.</p><h3>Run Over</h3><p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to double its drive speed and run over any creatures at least two size categories smaller than the vehicle during this movement. Those creatures take bludgeoning damage equal to the vehicle’s collision damage, but can each attempt a Reflex save against the vehicle’s collision DC to take half damage. Roll the damage only once and apply it to each creature, rather than rolling separately for each. A vehicle’s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see Vehicles on page 228).</p><p>When you take a run over action, the vehicle takes damage equal to half the damage rolled for each creature it runs over. If the vehicle becomes unable to proceed due to this damage, it ceases moving. You can still set the vehicle’s heading at the end of this movement as normal.</p><p>A vehicle taking the run over action can damage a creature no more than once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. The vehicle can run over objects of the appropriate size with the same effects, though they don’t receive saving throws unless they are piloted or otherwise animate.</p><h2>Swift Actions</h2><p>It takes a swift action to engage or disengage a vehicle’s autocontrol or autopilot or to relinquish control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p><h3>Engage or Disengage Autocontrol</h3><p>You can engage a vehicle’s autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action. You can disengage its autocontrol as a swift action anytime. See Autocontrol below for more.</p><h3>Engage or Disengage Autopilot</h3><p>You can engage a vehicle’s autopilot as a swift action (see Autopilot below).</p><h3>Relinquish Control</h3><p>You can voluntarily hand over control of a vehicle to another pilot as a swift action. If you relinquish control of a vehicle but another pilot does not take over control, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled (see Uncontrolled Vehicles below).</p><h2>Not an Action</h2><p>The following does not require an action.</p><h3>Stop</h3><p>You can stop a vehicle after a drive action without difficulty and without spending an action.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"npWrxLDvORoSs6K5","name":"Uncontrolled Vehicles","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB  pg. 280</p><p>If you are knocked out or cease actively piloting, your vehicle becomes uncontrolled.

In the normal rules, Build Points are a pool that constantly increases as the PCs level up, but in this subsystem, Build Points become a form of currency. The PCs spend BP to buy a starship and cargo, and they earn BP whenever they make a sale.</p><p>The PCs’ starship becomes an investment like any other piece of equipment, but bought with BP instead of credits. As the PCs complete jobs, they get more Build Points to spend on upgrading their starship. They can do so gradually, installing one new system at a time, or they can hoard BP and then spend them all at once. However, the PCs should always keep some BP on hand to buy the cargo for their next job. If the PCs’ ship is destroyed, they also lose the BP they invested in it! (Many crews insure their starships for just this eventuality; see page 54 for details.) But if the PCs’ business flourishes, they’ll find themselves living in the lap of luxury, hiring additional employees, or even buying a second starship to ply the interstellar trade routes.</p><p>The Starfinder Core Rulebook includes some guidelines for how PCs can acquire the BP they need to build and upgrade their first starship—via salvage, favors, or an arrangement with a friendly spacedock, for instance. In this case, Build Points represent much more than simple credits and become exclusively useful through the starship creation system, staying separate from the methods by which PCs buy their personal equipment. This separation provides an important distinction because if PCs had the ability to exchange Build Points for credits, they could end up underpowered in starship combat while simultaneously overpowered in all their other encounters.</p><p>In the rules presented here, Build Points roughly represent the party’s business capital. That capital has many components, including the PCs’ available credit, loans they’ve taken out, and assets they might use as collateral. PCs use this capital to make big purchases, like cargo or starship modifications, often with financing help from a bank or other establishment.</p><p>To begin, the PCs receive a number of Build Points determined by their Average Party Level (APL) as noted in Table 9–1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. They should use this BP to build their starship; you might want to remind the PCs that their vessel needs plenty of room for cargo and that they’ll have to spend a few BP to purchase that cargo.

You take a cumulative –1 penalty to this roll for every find cargo activity you or your allies have previously attempted in this settlement within the last week.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> On a success, you find 1d4 lots of cargo that you can buy. The cargo can’t be split up; all of the lots must be bought together. The cargo’s total buy price equals 1d4 BP × the number of lots.

All of the cargo must be transported and sold together; you and your allies must load the cargo onto your starship yourselves. You might have to deliver some cargoes within a certain time frame. When you’re told the type of cargo, its buy price, and (if applicable) its destination and its sell price, you can choose not to purchase that cargo. However, when you purchase the cargo, you decide what to do with it, though you might want to perform the find buyer downtime activity (see below) at another settlement to sell it.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p><h3>Shipping or Speculation?</h3><p>When the PCs purchase cargo, they generally have to find a place to sell it themselves. After all, transport drivers who earn flat rates usually cover established shipping routes; as galactic traders, the PCs typically do more than that. However, at your discretion, the seller can give the PCs a tip as to where they might offload the cargo they just bought. This tactic can benefit players who’ve just started interacting with this system or for groups who only want to dip their toes into the trading game. In such cases, the PCs don’t need to use the find buyer downtime activity (see above), and they receive an amount of BP of your choosing per cargo lot.</p><h3>Destination</h3><p>If you’ve decided that the cargo’s seller gives the PCs an idea of where to sell those goods, you can choose that destination based on the needs of your campaign (especially if the players have expressed interest in going to a specific place). Alternatively, you can randomly determine the general destination by rolling a d10 on the table below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>[[/r D10]]</td><td>DESTINATION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}. If the PCs are already on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, reroll.</td></tr><tr><td>2–4</td><td>A different world in the same star system where the PCs bought the cargo.</td></tr><tr><td>5–7</td><td>A world in Near Space.</td></tr><tr><td>8–10</td><td>A world in the Vast.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Determine Complication</h2><p>Once a PC finds the cargo, but before they commit to purchasing it, you should determine what makes this particular job unusual. You decide the complication, and the PCs decide how to deal with it—if they even become aware of the problem, that is!</p><p>To randomly determine a complication, roll a d10 on the table below, keeping the result a secret. You can tweak the result as needed for your campaign; once you’ve rolled the same result from the table a couple of times, consider throwing out that entry and substituting one of your own! If a complication requires a skill check, the DC for that check equals 15 + 1-1/2 × the party’s APL. Usually, only one PC should attempt this check. An asterisk (*) marks a complication that the PCs can be made aware of before purchasing the cargo, and some complications modify the buy or sell price of the cargo.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>[[/r D10]]</td><td>COMPLICATION</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Competition</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Expiration Date*</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Handling Problems</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>High Demand*</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Imitation*</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Regulated*</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Stolen</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Stowaway</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Strange Customs</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Tough Sell</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Competition:</strong> Once the PCs have loaded their cargo and determined their destination, a rival crew contacts them and declares they’re selling similar cargo at that location. Determine how long the rival crew takes to reach the destination (usually assuming average time in the Drift); if the PCs don’t beat the rival crew to the destination, the sell price is reduced by 2 BP per lot.</p><p><strong>Expiration Date*:</strong> This cargo is perishable. If the PCs don’t deliver it in 2d8 days, they can sell it for a maximum of 1 BP per lot.</p><p><strong>Handling Problems:</strong> There’s a potential accident while loading or unloading the cargo. Treat this complication as a trap with a CR equal to the party’s APL. The exact nature of the trap and the skills necessary to disable it are up to you.</p><p><strong>High Demand*:</strong> This cargo is trending. The buy price is increased by 1 BP per lot, and the sell price is increased by 2 BP per lot.</p><p><strong>Imitation*:</strong> These goods are actually cheap knockoffs. A PC can detect this fact with a successful Perception check, reducing the buy and sell prices by 2 BP per lot. If the PCs want to try to sell the goods at the unreduced price, they must succeed at a Bluff check or else attract the attention of law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Regulated*:</strong> Exhaustive laws govern this cargo at the point of purchase. A PC must succeed at a Computers or Profession (merchant) check, or the crew members must spend 1 day navigating customs and filling out forms before they can load the cargo on their ship.</p><p><strong>Stolen:</strong> This cargo was stolen from another crew, and they’re coming to get it back! This complication represents a hard encounter, but the PCs can pacify the NPCs by surrendering the cargo.</p><p><strong>Stowaway:</strong> An NPC with a CR equal to the party’s APL hides among the cargo, revealing themself after takeoff. A PC who succeeds at a Perception check can detect the stowaway during the cargo-loading process.</p><p><strong>Strange Customs:</strong> The buyer comes from an unfamiliar culture or has unusual traditions. A PC must attempt a Culture check to maintain proper etiquette. If they succeed, the sell price increases by 1 BP per lot. If they fail, the sell price decreases by 1 BP per lot.</p><p><strong>Tough Sell:</strong> The buyer tries to strong-arm the PCs, reducing the sell price by 2 BP per lot. A PC can negate this reduction with a successful Intimidate check.</p><h2>Transport</h2><p>Next, the PCs must get the cargo onto their starship and transport it to a place where they can sell it. In general, the farther the PCs take the cargo, the more it’s worth (see Table below).</p><h3>Cargo Handling</h3><p> Loading or unloading a single lot into a starship cargo hold takes 1 hour for one person using a cargo lifter (Core Rulebook 204) or similar equipment. Without such equipment, loading the same lot takes 8 hours of labor; multiple people can work together to reduce this time. For example, it takes 4 hours for two people without major equipment to load a single lot into a cargo hold. While the PCs can usually take their time, a complication might mean that every hour counts!</p><p>The PCs must also unload the cargo once they reach the world where they want to sell it, but unloading generally occurs while at least one of the crew engages in the find buyer downtime activity (page 54).</p><h2>Make the Sale</h2><p>Once the PCs have reached the area where they want to try to sell their cargo, finding a buyer is a downtime activity detailed below. Certain complications might make this activity more difficult, but once a PC finds a buyer, you need to determine the sale price.</p><h3>Cargo Sell Price</h3><p>First, determine the base sell price of a cargo by rolling a d8; if you roll an 8, roll again once, and add the new result to 8. This result is modified by the distance traveled (as noted on the table below) and any complications, in that order; the total results in a sale price per lot (minimum 1 BP per lot). Finally, the results of the PCs’ find buyer downtime activity can also alter this price.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>TRAVEL TIME</td><td>DESTINATION</td><td>BASE SELL PRICE MODIFIER</td></tr><tr><td>[[/r 1d6 #days]] days</td><td>Another world in the system or @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}</td><td>–2 BP/lot</td></tr><tr><td>[[/r 2d6 #days]] days</td><td>One of the Pact Worlds other than @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} from outside the system</td><td>–1 BP/lot</td></tr><tr><td>[[/r 3d6 #days]] days</td><td>A Near Space world</td><td>No change</td></tr><tr><td>[[/r 5d6 #days]] days</td><td>A Vast world</td><td>+1 BP/lot</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Find Buyer</h3><p>You look for someone interested in buying your cargo.</p><p><strong>Activity:</strong> You spend a day researching markets on the infosphere, checking with union or guild representatives, meeting with local contacts, and haggling. You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find a buyer in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your level).</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> On a success, you find someone willing to buy your cargo for the sell price (as determined by the GM). For every 5 by which your check exceeds the DC, increase the sell price of the cargo by 1 BP per lot. If you fail, you still find a buyer, but the sell price of the cargo is reduced by 1 BP per lot.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"ZdYyjYlsHwAQrOe5","name":"Spending Build Points","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>AP #34 pg. 53</p><p>The following section expands on the rules for spending Build Points and includes some obligatory expenditures (like upgrading the PCs’ starship so they can take on more lucrative jobs and bigger threats) as well as new options (like having a comfortable lifestyle or hiring employees). The PCs can hold onto as many unspent BP as they like.</p><h2>Expansion</h2><p>The PCs can spend BP to hire agents, professional representatives, and even full-time employees who work for them. They can also buy another starship and hire crew to haul cargo as part of their overall operations. When the PCs hire personnel to expand their business, you decide the NPCs’ stats (though usually, an NPC has a total skill bonus in a handful of skills equal to 4 + 1-1/2 × their CR). Though usually loyal to the PCs, these NPCs won’t risk their lives. If treated poorly, they might leave the PCs’ service. An employee hired by the PCs agrees to a 1-year contract; at the end of that term, the PCs must hire them again, or the NPC leaves their service.</p><p><strong>Planetary Agent</strong>: A planetary agent costs BP equal to the agent’s CR, which can be no higher than the party’s APL; as the party’s APL increases, the PCs can spend the difference to raise the agent’s CR. The agent lives on one world or space station; while they may have many other clients, they work on the PCs’ behalf to perform the find cargo and find buyer downtime activities. The agent can also perform the gather information task of the Diplomacy skill. The agent won’t leave the world on which they’re stationed. The PCs must supply the agent with the credits or other requirements necessary for any task they ask the NPC to perform.</p><p><strong>System-Wide Representative:</strong> A system-wide representative operates similarly to a planetary agent, but the system-wide representative will travel to any world in a single star system (such as the Pact Worlds system). A system-wide representative costs BP equal to twice the representative’s CR, which can be no higher than the party’s APL.</p><p><strong>Starship:</strong> The PCs can use their BP to buy another starship. This starship can’t be higher in tier than the party’s APL – 2. The PCs must spend additional BP equal to 5 × the starship’s tier to hire an NPC crew to run this starship; each crew member has a CR equal to the starship’s tier, and they follow the PCs’ instructions when it comes to buying, transporting, and selling cargo as well as the starship’s day-to-day operations. All the BP earned by this other ship goes to the party’s pool of BP. The PCs are responsible for the costs and maintenance of any additional starships they own.</p><h2>Insurance</h2><p>The PCs can insure their starship or cargo. Starship insurance policies cost a number of BP equal to a percentage of their starship’s total BP value at time of purchase (see below). An insurance policy remains in effect for 1 year; after this time, the PCs must buy a new policy (at a higher price if their starship has increased in BP value). If the PCs’ starship is completely destroyed with a policy in effect, the PCs receive a percentage of the ship’s BP value in payment. The rest of the Build Points the PCs spent on their starship are lost!</p><p>Starship insurance policies are rated bronze, silver, and gold. A bronze insurance policy costs 5% of the starship’s total BP value and pays out 50% of the total value. A silver insurance policy costs 10% of the starship’s total BP value and pays out 75% of the total value. A gold insurance policy costs 15% of the starship’s total BP value and pays out 100% of the total value.</p><p>To insure cargo, the PCs can buy a policy for 10% of the cargo’s buy price (minimum 1 BP). If the cargo is lost and not delivered, and the PCs can prove that they didn’t steal or lose the cargo through negligence, they’re repaid BP equal to the cargo’s buy price.</p><p>The PCs can have only one insurance policy per starship and per each cargo.</p><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>The PCs can spend BP to live the good life. These lifestyles assume a group of 4 PCs; you can adjust the costs for larger and smaller groups as you see fit. Lifestyles don’t impart any mechanical benefits to the characters.</p><p><strong>Comfortable:</strong> The party spends 1 BP to live comfortably for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in spacious lodgings decorated to their taste and have access to stylish personal transportation. They partake in high-quality food and drink whenever they wish, and they attire themselves in fashionable and flattering clothing.</p><p><strong>Luxurious:</strong> The party spends 5 BP to live in luxury for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in fabulous homes in an elite neighborhood; they have multiple forms of personal transportation, and unique fashions made for them by famous designers (equivalent to formal wear) fill their wardrobes. A large staff of professionals—housekeepers, gardeners, personal tailors and groomers, a chauffeur—see to everyday chores the PCs don’t wish to concern themselves with (each professional is a professional freelancer with a skill bonus equal to the party’s APL).</p><h2>Upgrades</h2><p>The PCs can spend BP on their starship if they have the time and facilities required make such upgrades (Starfinder Core Rulebook 305). Using this system, the total BP value of the PCs’ starship can be no more than 5% more than the value listed for its tier in Table 9-1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. For example: a group of 1st-level PCs have a tier 1 starship on which they have spent a total of 52 Build Points (saving the rest to purchase cargo). As they accumulate BP by selling cargo, they can spend, at most, 5 BP to upgrade their starship, raising its BP value to 57 (5% more than the 55 BP used to normally create a tier 1 starship). When their APL rises to 2, this group can upgrade their starship further but no higher than 78 BP (because a tier 2 starship is normally created with 75 BP). The PCs still can’t spend more than 1,000 BP on their starship when their APL reaches 20.</p><h2>Downgrades</h2><p>Due to bad luck or mishandling of cargo, the PCs might end up with no spare BP to keep the cycle of buying and selling going. In such cases, the PCs can sell parts of their starship to acquire BP. There’s no added cost to downgrade; for instance, if the PCs want to pawn their vessel’s coilgun, they receive the weapon’s full BP cost of 6.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"CV3FolrP4N0Mb6q7","name":"Running The System","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":400000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>AP #34 pg. 53</p><p>In many ways, this subsystem helps generate short adventures for your cargo-hauling PCs since there’s always a chance of something going a little wrong. At the very least, the system works hand-in-hand with a sandbox-style campaign, as the PCs travel from world to world looking to buy low and sell high!</p><h2>Session Zero</h2><p>Before beginning a game using the galactic trade subsystem, make sure your players are interested in engaging in the life of freelance merchants. While it might not seem as glamorous as delving into alien ruins or fighting back against an evil empire (though galactic traders can still undertake such adventures), this type of campaign has its appeal to certain players. Generally, merchant PCs aren’t beholden to any one patron and can go where they please. However, if your group doesn’t seem keen on the bookkeeping required, it might be better not to use this subsystem!</p><h2>GMing Expectations</h2><p>On average, the PCs will need to complete three to four cargo transport jobs to gain enough BP to upgrade their starship to the next tier. As the group advances in level, they might need to complete a few extra transport jobs per tier, depending on their market savvy and whether or not they’ve switched to a larger frame that can hold more cargo.</p><p>Of course, during this time, the PCs should earn XP in the usual ways (by overcoming skill-based challenges, defeating enemies, and earning story-based rewards) so that the group’s APL keeps approximate pace with the amount of BP they can invest in their starship. At your discretion, you can reward the PCs with XP as if they had overcome an easy encounter (Starfinder Core Rulebook 390) upon selling their cargo; you should add this XP to any XP they earn from encounters that emerge from complications.</p><h2>Other Sources of Build Points</h2><p>This subsystem assumes that the PCs earn their BP only from transporting and selling cargo. However, at your discretion, you can reward them with BP as treasure from particular encounters (such as a raid on a smuggling operation’s warehouses) or as salvage from starship combat encounters (such as a fight against a rogue Corpse Fleet ship). In the former case, the PCs have to transport the BP to their ship much in the same way as loading cargo (count a cargo lot as 4 BP for these purposes), and in the latter case, the PCs can earn a number of BP depending on the enemy starship’s size category (Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, etc.).</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"dHAkyxQZrTVnsqDs","name":"Free Traders","type":"text","image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":500000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source: </strong>AP #34 pg. 53</p><p>The free trader archetype is an excellent choice for a character in a campaign focused on galactic trade.

Luckily, weapon accessories can provide additional utility with just a little tinkering, which you can do yourself or pay a professional to handle. Weapon accessories modify existing weapons to provide certain benefits to the weapon’s user. Experienced operators keep a variety of accessories on hand, swapping them out as needed.</p></blockquote><h2>Using Weapon Accessories</h2><p>Explanations of the statistics for weapon accessories are provided below, along with the rules for adding accessories to weapons. Specific accessories are sometimes exceptions to these rules.</p><h3>Capacity And Usage</h3><p>Some accessories require power to function, similar to some technological items; see page 218 of the Core Rulebook for more information. These accessories are identified with capacity and usage entries in Table 1–11: Weapon Accessories. A weapon accessory’s capacity is the highest-capacity battery that the accessory can use. Usage lists the rate at which charges are consumed when the accessory is used. Attached accessories (see Adding Accessories below) must use their own batteries, but an accessory integrated into a powered weapon can be configured to use either the weapon’s battery or its own battery.</p><h3>Weapon Type</h3><p>Some accessories can be added only to specific types or categories of weapons, as noted in the Weapon Type entry in Table 1–11: Weapon Accessories. For the most part, these correspond to the weapon types and categories described on pages 169–170 of the Core Rulebook.</p><p>Railed Weapons: Railed weapons are longarms, heavy weapons, and sniper weapons, all of which have rails along or near the weapon’s barrel that allow you to easily add accessories to the weapon. A railed weapon has four rails to which accessories can be added: one on top, one on the bottom, and one on either side. Only one weapon accessory can be added to each rail. Some accessories must be attached to a specific rail, such as the top or bottom, as detailed in the accessory’s description.</p><h3>Adding Accessories</h3><p>Weapon accessories must normally be added to a weapon to function. Most accessories can be added either by being attached to a weapon or by being integrated into the weapon, though some accessories must be added in a certain way, as indicated in the accessory’s description. In either case, add the bulk of the weapon accessory to the weapon’s bulk to determine the final accessorized weapon’s bulk. When adding multiple items of light bulk together, treat 2–10 light bulk items as 1 bulk when combined.</p><p>Attachment: An attached weapon accessory is affixed to a weapon but is not really part of it. Anyone can attach or detach an accessory as a full action, and most weapons dealers will attach an accessory bought from them at no extra charge.</p><p>Integration: An integrated weapon accessory is built into the weapon, becoming part of it. Integrated accessories are usually purchased already integrated into the weapon at the combined price of the weapon and the accessory. If the weapon and accessory are purchased separately, a weapons dealer can integrate the accessory into the weapon for a fee of 10% of the accessory’s purchase price. You can integrate an accessory into a weapon (or remove an integrated accessory) if you have a number of ranks in Engineering (or both Engineering and Mysticism, for hybrid accessories) equal to the item level of the weapon or accessory, whichever is higher. It takes 1 hour to integrate an accessory or remove an integrated accessory from a weapon.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":false},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}

If an extraordinary ability doesn’t specify what type of action is required to activate it, it requires a standard action.</p><p>The DC of an extraordinary ability is typically equal to 10 + half the level of the creature using it + the creature’s relevant ability score modifier, as detailed in the ability’s description.</p><p>Extraordinary abilities are often denoted with the abbreviation “Ex” in parentheses next to the ability’s name.</p><h2>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</h2><p>Spell-like abilities are magical abilities that function very much like spells do (see Casting Spells starting on page 330). The main difference is that you gained the ability through a different means than normal spellcasters gain spells. A spell-like ability has a casting time of a standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell description. Usually, a spell-like ability either can be used a specific number of times per day, can be used at will, or can affect a creature constantly. If a spell requires an expenditure of credits or Resolve Points as part of its casting, a creature that can cast the spell as a spell-like ability does not need to pay such costs. Creatures with spell-like abilities that can be made permanent still must pay any costs and take the listed amount of time to do so. In all other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.</p><p>Because it functions like a spell, using a spell-like ability in a threatened square usually provokes attacks of opportunity (see page 248) unless the text of the ability or the spell it emulates specifically says otherwise.</p><p>Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and dispel magic. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated.</p><p>Just as for spells, a spell-like ability’s caster level determines the ability’s power (see Caster Level on page 331). If no caster level is specified in the ability’s description, the caster level is equal to the creature’s character level or CR. The DC of a spell-like ability is typically equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the Charisma modifier of the creature using it. If a class grants a spell-like ability that is not based on an actual spell, the ability’s effective spell level is equal to the highest-level class spell the character could cast at the class level the ability is granted.</p><p>Spell-like abilities are often denoted with the abbreviation “Sp” in parentheses next to the ability’s name.</p><h2>Supernatural Abilities (Su)</h2><p>Supernatural abilities are magical but differ from spells in key ways. Unlike spells, which can be interrupted while being cast, supernatural abilities can’t be disrupted in combat. They aren’t subject to spell resistance or dispel magic, but they don’t function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated.</p><p>The text of a supernatural ability indicates what type of action is required to use it, as well as how often it can be used. If a supernatural ability doesn’t specify what type of action is required to activate it, it requires a standard action.</p><p>The DC of a supernatural ability is typically equal to 10 + half the level of the creature using it + the creature’s relevant ability score modifier, as detailed in the ability’s description.</p><p>Supernatural abilities are often denoted with the abbreviation “Su” in parentheses next to the ability’s name.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}},{"_id":"Z6Ic1uVsusm2rXtj","name":"Regaining Daily-Use Abilities and Spells","type":"text","flags":{},"image":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"sort":300000,"src":null,"system":{},"text":{"content":"<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 262</p><p>Some abilities have a limited number of uses per day.

The ability’s source typically indicates whether it is extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural. In general, if an ability’s source does not indicate its type, the ability is extraordinary.</p><h2>Blindsense</h2><p>Blindsense is the ability to use an imprecise nonvisual sense (or a combination of senses; see page 260) to operate effectively without vision. Blindsense operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</p><p>A creature with blindsense typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsense entry in the creature’s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—say, for example, if a creature that uses sound to perceive through its blindsense becomes deaf—the creature loses access entirely to its blindsense. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsense can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</p><p>If you have the blindsense special ability and succeed at a Perception check to notice an unseen creature, you become aware of the creature’s location. Blindsense negates the bonuses to Stealth checks that an unseen creature would otherwise receive, but unseen creatures still have total concealment against the attacks of creatures with blindsense, and creatures with blindsense are still flat-footed against the attacks of unseen creatures. See Dealing with Unseen Creatures on page 261 for more information.</p><h2>Blindsight</h2><p>Blindsight is a precise nonvisual sense (or a combination of senses; see page 260) that functions as a more potent version of blindsense. Blindsight operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</p><p>A creature with blindsight typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsight entry in the creature’s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—say, for example, if a creature that uses scent to perceive through its blindsight loses its sense of smell—the creature loses access entirely to its blindsight. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsight can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</p><p>If you have blindsight and succeed at a Perception check to notice a hidden creature, you are observing the creature. Blindsight negates concealment, displacement, invisibility, magical darkness, and similar effects, though a creature with blindsight still can’t perceive ethereal creatures (see the ethereal jaunt spell on page 354). A creature with blindsight cannot be blinded (see page 273) and is not subject to gaze attacks (see the Starfinder Alien Archive).</p><p>Blindsight is still limited in many ways compared to normal vision. Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast, though it might be able to make out other features depending on the sense. A creature cannot read written text with blindsight, though it could still use tactile communication. Blindsight works underwater and in fog or smoke, but it typically does not work in a vacuum (although this depends on the nature of the sense; for instance, emotion-based blindsight would work in a vacuum).</p><h2>Damage Reduction (DR)</h2><p>Some creatures have the ability to instantly heal damage from attacks or ignore blows altogether; this is referred to as the damage reduction special ability. Damage reduction (DR) applies to kinetic damage—any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—that a character takes, regardless of that damage’s source. It does not apply against damage with no damage type or any other damage type, including acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, though these can be mitigated by energy resistance (see page 264).</p><p>The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage the creature ignores from each attack. Weapons made from a certain material, magic weapons (any weapon with a weapon fusion; see page 191), and weapons imbued with a specific alignment often can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/cold iron means that you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not made from cold iron, DR 5/magic means you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not magic, and so on. If a dash follows the slash (“DR 5/—”), then the damage reduction is effective against bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from any weapon, though some attacks have their own ability to overcome DR. Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with a magic fusion or alignment is treated as a magic weapon or having the listed alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Sometimes, multiple types of weapon materials or alignments are indicated after the value of DR, indicating that the damage reduction can be overcome in multiple ways or requires a specific combination of effects to be overcome. For example, DR 5/lawful or magic means any weapon that is of a lawful alignment or that is magic can overcome the damage reduction. In contrast, DR 5/lawful and magic means only weapons that are both of a lawful alignment and magic overcome the damage reduction.</p><p>Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an injury-based disease, an operative’s debilitating trick, and poison delivered via an injury. Damage reduction does not negate ability damage, ability drain, energy damage dealt as part of an attack, or negative levels, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.</p><p>If you have damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack unless the sources granting the damage reduction specifically note otherwise. Instead, you get the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation. Rarely, an effect specifies that it increases a creature’s existing damage reduction.</p><p>Sometimes damage reduction represents instant healing, while in other cases it reflects the creature’s tough hide or body. In either case, you can see that a conventional attack hasn’t been effective.</p><h2>Darkvision</h2><p>Darkvision is the ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified in the creature’s description. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise— when a creature has darkvision, invisible objects and creatures are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally (see the Starfinder Alien Archive). The presence of light does not affect darkvision.</p><h2>Energy Resistance</h2><p>A creature with resistance to energy has the ability to ignore some energy damage of a certain type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) per attack. Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how much damage is resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage is from a mundane or magical source. If an attack deals both kinetic damage and energy damage (such as dealing 3d6 bludgeoning and 1d6 fire damage), energy resistance applies to the energy damage but doesn’t reduce the kinetic damage.</p><p>If energy resistance completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an operative’s debilitating trick or poison delivered via an injury. Energy resistance does not negate ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels dealt along with an energy attack, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.</p><p>If you have energy resistance against the same energy type from more than one source, the two forms of energy resistance do not stack unless the sources of the energy resistance specifically note otherwise. Rarely, an effect specifies that it increases a creature’s existing energy resistance.</p><h2>Incorporeal</h2><p>An incorporeal creature doesn’t have a physical body. It is immune to all nonmagical kinetic attacks. All energy attacks and magical kinetic attacks deal half damage (50%) to it. An incorporeal creature takes full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as from all force effects. Corporeal spells and effects that do not cause damage have only a 50% chance of affecting an incorporeal creature. An incorporeal creature is immune to critical hits.</p><p>Incorporeal creatures’ attacks always target their enemies’ Energy Armor Class. Incorporeal creatures cannot take any physical actions that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, including combat maneuvers, nor are they subject to any such actions.</p><p>An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects but must remain adjacent to such an object’s exterior, and so it cannot pass through the center of an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within squares adjacent to its current location (see page 260), but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance; see Concealment on page 253) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it has only cover (see Cover starting on page 253). An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in vacuum, water, and zero gravity as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. They have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered only by weight.</p><p>Incorporeal creatures move silently and cannot be heard with Perception checks unless they wish to be. Any sense (including blindsense or blindsight) based on scent, sound, or touch is ineffective at perceiving incorporeal creatures. These creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p><h2>Invisible</h2><p>An invisible creature is visually undetectable. A creature using only an imprecise sense, or whose only precise sense is vision, can’t observe an invisible creature, so the invisible creature is unseen by such a would-be observer. Creatures with blindsight can perceive invisible creatures normally, since blindsight is a precise sense that does not rely on vision, and thus can observe invisible creatures. See Senses on page 260 and Dealing with Unseen Creatures on page 261 for more information.</p><p>Invisible creatures remain invisible even in unusual environments, such as underwater, and when subject to effects such as fog or smoke. They are not magically silenced. They can still be heard, smelled, and felt as normal, even if other creatures can’t see them. Invisible creatures leave tracks and can be tracked normally. A character looking for an invisible creature might find his quarry if the invisible creature drops an item, speaks, smells strongly, leaves an obvious trail, or performs some action that makes itself known. Finding an invisible creature in this way requires a Perception check as normal. If successful, and assuming your only precise sense is vision, you become aware of the invisible creature’s presence, but you don’t know its exact location. If you’re looking for an invisible creature, the GM might rule that you have a bonus or penalty to your Perception checks based on the situation.</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items it picks up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus creating the effect of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the creature carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Invisibility does not thwart divination spells or effects. Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks (see the Starfinder Alien Archive). If you are or become invisible while grappled, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to escape being grappled, but you gain no other benefit against the grappler.</p><h2>Low-Light Vision</h2><p>Characters with low-light vision can see in dim light as if it were normal light (see Vision and Light on page 261).</p><h2>Sense Through</h2><p>Sense through is the special ability to perceive things beyond an obstacle or barrier that would otherwise block normal senses. It allows a creature to attempt Perception checks into areas that would otherwise lie beyond its senses. Sense through augments a creature’s precise or imprecise senses, rather than replacing them. For example, a creature cannot have a form of sense through based on vision unless it has standard vision. Sense through may be a supernatural power to sense things beyond normal perception or an extraordinary ability representing enhanced senses, and it can be granted by equipment (such as laser microphones and X-ray visors), natural abilities (such as some dragons’ ability to see through smoke), and other effects. Sense through operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</p><p>A creature with sense through typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision) allows a creature to see through obstacles that would normally block vision. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—for example, if a creature whose vision is augmented by sense through is blinded—the creature loses access to its sense through ability. The typical senses through which creatures with sense through can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, hearing, vibration, and vision.</p><p>A creature with sense through (vision) is considered to have darkvision to a range of 60 feet unless stated otherwise. This enables the creature to perceive through materials such as armor, briefcases, and other concealing items, meaning the creature can use Perception to search more quickly and easily (searching up to a 20-foot-by-20-foot area in a single round), though such quick searches reveal only things accessible by that sense. If a secret door is concealed behind a material that blocks this ability (see below), a quick search using sense through (vision) would not reveal it.</p><p>Some sense through abilities allow a creature to sense through only specific materials. Such materials are indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision [smoke only]) allows a creature to see through smoke as if it were not present, but all other obstacles to vision work normally. A sense through ability that works against only a specific material otherwise works like the sense it is associated with, including requiring Perception checks to notice things.</p><h3>Blocking Sense Through</h3><p>Some sense through abilities (generally those of a magical nature) cannot penetrate specific materials. This is indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, a lycanthrope with sense through (scent [blocked by silver]) can smell through walls—but not through even a thin layer of silver.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, in addition to all other limitations, sense through is blocked by energy fields and sufficiently dense material. This includes all energy fields that impact the physical world (such as force fields that grant temporary Hit Points and force effects such as the wall of force spell). The density limitation generally causes these senses to be blocked by 10 feet of wood or plastic, 5 feet of stone, 1 foot of common metal, or 6 inches of lead or any starmetal (such as adamantine). Typical suits of armor and containers do not block such vision unless they specify otherwise.</p><h2>Spell Resistance (SR)</h2><p>Spell resistance (SR) is the ability to avoid being affected by spells and spell-like abilities, much like an Armor Class against magical attacks. To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) with a DC equal to the creature’s spell resistance. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. A creature with spell resistance does not have to do anything special to use that ability and need not even be aware of a threat for its spell resistance to function.</p><p>A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities. A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance as a standard action. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the spell resistance automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (this also requires a standard action).</p><h3>When Spell Resistance Applies</h3><p>Spell resistance applies if a spell targets a creature with spell resistance, or if such a creature is within a spell’s area of effect. If several creatures with spell resistance are targeted by a spell or within a spell’s area, each checks its spell resistance separately (that is, the caster rolls a separate caster level check for each). Unless a spell specifically targets a single creature, spell resistance protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself; other creatures without spell resistance targeted by a spell or within a spell’s area are affected by the spell normally. Some spells can ignore spell resistance; this is detailed in the spells’ descriptions.</p><p>Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast, such as if the creature enters the area of an active spell effect. Check spell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell. A creature checks its spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell, but separately for each distinct casting of a spell. If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell, as when the creature enters and reenters an area effect. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds for the same casting of the spell. If the creature has voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance first resumes.</p><h2>Telepathy</h2><p>A creature with the telepathy special ability can mentally communicate with any other creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s description, though the range of telepathy is usually 100 feet) that knows a language or also has telepathy. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.</p><h3>Limited Telepathy</h3><p>Limited telepathy functions in the same manner as telepathy, except that both the creature with the limited telepathy special ability and the creature it is communicating with must have a language in common.</p>","format":1,"markdown":""},"title":{"level":1,"show":true},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5}}]}
