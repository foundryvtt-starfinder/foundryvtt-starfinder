{"_id":"3NE2nvMbEhINPfdr","name":"Blindsight","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Blindsight is a precise nonvisual sense (or a combination of senses; see page 260) that functions as a more potent version of blindsense. Blindsight operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with blindsight typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsight entry in the creature’s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—say, for example, if a creature that uses scent to perceive through its blindsight loses its sense of smell—the creature loses access entirely to its blindsight. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsight can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have blindsight and succeed at a Perception check to notice a hidden creature, you are observing the creature. Blindsight negates concealment, <em>displacement</em>, invisibility, magical darkness, and similar effects, though a creature with blindsight still can’t perceive ethereal creatures (see the <em>ethereal jaunt</em> spell on page 354). A creature with blindsight cannot be blinded (see page 273) and is not subject to gaze attacks (see the <em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em>).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Blindsight is still limited in many ways compared to normal vision. Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast, though it might be able to make out other features depending on the sense. A creature cannot read written text with blindsight, though it could still use tactile communication. Blindsight works underwater and in fog or smoke, but it typically does not work in a vacuum (although this depends on the nature of the sense; for instance, emotion-based blindsight would work in a vacuum).</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"4D8xxzNTkAujTMHj","name":"Dynamic Hacking Actions","content":"<h2>HACKING ACTIONS</h2>\n<p>The following are common actions used in dynamic hacking encounters. At the GM’s discretion, a hacker might be able to perform actions other than these.</p>\n<h2>Aid (Minor)</h2>\n<p>You run programs, review diagnostics, or look for weaknesses that help your lead hacker with an upcoming task.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Choose one action that a lead hacker will attempt this phase. Attempt the same check, but the DC of your check instead equals 10 or the obstacle’s base DC – 10, whichever is higher. If the obstacle lists additional skills in its Support entry, you can attempt a check with one of those skills in place of the skill typically used for the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The lead hacker gains a +2 bonus to their check to perform that action if they do so before the end of the phase. The bonus increases to +3 if you exceed the DC by 5–9, and increases to +4 if you exceed the DC by 10 or more. A lead hacker can’t gain more than a +4 bonus to any one check from the aid action, even if aided by multiple allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> You can’t use this action to grant a bonus to one of your own actions.</p>\n<h2>Assess (Minor)</h2>\n<p>You study an obstacle to understand its features.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Process + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You learn the Resolve, Support, Countdown (including the current countdown value), Success, and Special entries for the obstacle. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to resolve the obstacle for 3 phases. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you also identify whether the obstacle has any hidden countermeasures, such as a data bomb or fake shell.</p>\n<h2>Blend (Major)</h2>\n<p>You camouflage your persona and conceal signs of your activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Deceive + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You increase the countdown of all objectives by 1. If you exceed the check’s DC by 5 or more, you can choose one objective and instead increase its countdown by 1d3.</p>\n<h2>Decoy (Major)</h2>\n<p>You create a fake persona that confounds countermeasures.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Deceive + 0</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You create a convincing decoy that lasts until the end of the encounter. When a countermeasure would affect your persona, it has an equal chance of affecting your persona or one of your decoys (such as a 1 in 3 chance of affecting your persona if you have two decoys). Once a countermeasure affects a decoy, that decoy is destroyed with no effect. Countermeasures that do not target a persona (such as wipe) ignore decoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Each time you successfully create a decoy, the DC to create additional decoys increases by 4.</p>\n<h2>Modify (Major)</h2>\n<p>You change a vulnerable program’s functions. This action has a wide range of applications, from deleting a program or changing a module’s data to building or installing a contingent virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> The check varies by the task, determined by the GM. Destroying or destabilizing programs typically requires a Hack check, whereas forging data or installing a backdoor typically requires a Deceive check. Simple tasks might reduce the DC by up to 5, whereas very complicated tasks might increase the DC by up to 5. Some tasks are so vast in scope that they require hours or more—beyond the scope of most hacking encounters.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You successfully perform the action.</p>\n<h2>Recalibrate (Major)</h2>\n<p>You adjust your persona’s subskills for new tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Process – 2</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Reassign the circumstance modifiers you applied when configuring your persona at the beginning of the encounter, setting each modifier between –3 and +3 so long as their sum does not exceed the value allowed by your computer or number of Computers ranks (page 70).</p>\n<h2>Repair (Major)</h2>\n<p>You restore damage sustained by your persona or that of an ally.</p>\n<p><strong>Check: </strong>Process – 5</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> You restore a number of the persona’s lost CP equal to 1d6 + half your ranks in Computers, Engineering, or Medicine (whichever is highest). If your check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, increase the CP recovered to 1d6 + your ranks in Computers, Engineering, or Medicine (whichever is highest).</p>\n<h2>Resolve (Major)</h2>\n<p>You identify and exploit weaknesses in an objective’s code or behavior. This is the action used to defeat objectives, as noted in their respective Resolve entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> The checks required vary by objective.</p>\n<p><strong>Success: </strong>You achieve one success toward resolving the objective. If the objective requires multiple successful checks using the subskill you used, and if your check result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, this action is instead treated as two successes toward resolving the objective.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"AoGIedPXZpPJUbzz","name":"Tech Relics","content":"<p><span style=\"font-size:11.6667px;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">Source Starfinder Tech Revolution pg. 64</span></p>\n<p>Relics of fallen civilizations, alternate timelines, or cultures vanished in the Gap are scattered throughout the galaxy, awaiting rediscovery. Each tech relic is indeed a lucky find, for they can’t normally be recreated with modern technological or even magical means. Their very construction often defies foundational principles of modern science.</p>\n<p>Relics of ancient kishalee and sivv civilizations can be found in Starfinder Adventure Path #5: The Thirteenth Gate and Starfinder Adventure Path #33: Dominion’s End, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Relics Overview</h2>\n<p>Relics are rare, lost technologies less powerful than artifacts. They might be weapons, armor, or any other kind of equipment, but they can’t be crafted in a usual manner and are thus always special. Although relics have unusual abilities, each relic has a level—just like other equipment—to give a sense of its relative power and to indicate when it’s appropriate to introduce a relic in a campaign.</p>\n<p>Relics frequently spur adventures. As relics can be of any level, they can appear in adventures designed for PCs that are starting characters or veteran heroes. The PCs might hear rumors of an unusual and possibly unique piece of equipment, prompting them to brave mysterious ruins or contend with cutthroat treasure-seekers to claim the relic as their prize. The PCs might have an enigmatic relic fall into their laps while completing some other task and undertake a new mission to find out what it is, how it works, or how to activate it. A patron might offer a relic as a reward, though an honest one will typically admit the relic might prove more powerful—or more dangerous—than it appears. A cache of relics makes a good hoard for an inscrutable, ancient, or time-displaced villain.</p>\n<p>Relics are often unreliable. While PCs might learn some basics of a relic’s function by trial and error, the relic might work differently under variable conditions (such as when on another plane or used by certain creatures), glitch unexpectedly, or carry some unexpected detriment. Relics often use rare ammunition or batteries that can only be recharged under specific (and often unusual) circumstances; a relic with this type of limitation indicates this in its description. The GM can include other relic quirks or restrictions to keep the players on their toes, but be aware that such glitches might make the PCs regret having worked to collect such an unusual item in the first place!</p>\n<p>The relics presented here are predominantly technological in their function, but they have such strange abilities that they might feel more like magic to the players. All relics, whatever their type, have the following rule.</p>\n<p>Relic: A relic can be sold for 100% of the item’s price, like trade goods. A relic can’t be crafted without a specific (often long-lost) formula, and doing so often requires difficult-to-acquire materials. Even then, it’s rarely possible to recreate more than a few relics before expending the materials, depleting the required tools, or irrevocably warping the blueprints. A relic that becomes understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Relics</h2>\n<p>Weapon relics are abstruse devices discovered under mysterious circumstances. Unlike normal weapons, relic weapons don’t come fully loaded with ammunition unless noted, or unless they have some other indicated reloading method. They’re all treated as uncategorized weapons and are prone to unexpected backlash: on any attack roll of a natural 1, the user must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 the weapon’s level) or else the weapon deals damage to the user rather than the target. (Alternately, relics might use critical fumbles, from the Starfinder Critical Fumble Deck, even if those rules aren’t otherwise used in a campaign).</p>\n<h2>Quirks</h2>\n<p>A tech relic might have any of the following quirks, either randomly determined or specifically chosen.<br /><br /><strong>1. Burbling</strong>: The speech of anyone holding the relic becomes impossible to understand.<br /><strong>2. Crystalline</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it take double damage from sonic damage.<br /><strong>3. Fastidious</strong>: The relic and anyone holding it look clean, spotless, and new.<br /><strong>4. Floating</strong>: The relic can’t rest upon a surface, always hovering and slowly drifting away wherever it’s set down.<br /><strong>5. Keening</strong>: A mournful wail surrounds the relic unless it’s tightly wrapped up.<br /><strong>6. Marked</strong>: Anyone looking at the relic sees a maker’s mark or property tag bearing the viewer’s own name.<br /><strong>7. Menacing</strong>: Bystanders feel the relic is ineffably ominous. 8. Painful: The relic decreases the user’s pain threshold, imposing a –4 penalty to saving throws against pain effects.<br /><strong>9. Predictive</strong>: The relic often finishes the user’s sentences in the user’s voice.<br /><strong>10. Restless</strong>: The relic occasionally teleports itself 5–50 feet in a random direction when not carried or worn.<br /><strong>11. Shedding</strong>: The relic periodically sheds a shell that resembles its exterior, but the item never gets any smaller as a result.<br /><strong>12. Wasting</strong>: Any creature holding the relic seems unhealthy or dilapidated, taking a –2 penalty to saves against afflictions.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"ArWr3NdpKd1ScGn6","name":"Critical Fumble Tables","content":"<h2>CRITICAL FUMBLES</h2>\n<p>Players and GMs can use three methods to determine if an attack is a critical fumble, all triggering only if an attack roll is a natural 1 (the d20 comes up \"1\") and the total attack roll does not meet or exceed the target's AC. Because a critical fumble can be deadly, we recommend using the first option.</p>\n<p>• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker is not proficient with the weapon, or is blinded. confused, or affected by a condition that applies a penalty to attack rolls.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble if the attacker takes any penalties to the attack roll.<br />• An attack roll that comes up a natural 1 on the die and misses the target's AC is a critical fumble.</p>\n<h3>USING THE CRITICAL FUMBLE DECK</h3>\n<p>Whenever a character's attack roll is a critical fumble, the player or GM controlling the character draws one card from the deck and follows the result appropriate to that attack's type (energy, kinetic, or spell). If the Extreme Blow! effect matches the damage type (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire. piercing, slashing, or sonic), attack type' (melee or ranged), or weapon category (grenades), that effect must be used instead, </p>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>\n<p>• A critical fumble misses the target unless noted otherwise.<br />• if a critical fumble says you tike weapon damage, this is the base damage for the attack (even if it is an attack made without a weapon), and does not include bonuses for Weapon Specialization, ability modifiers, class features, or similar modifiers.<br />• Required ability checks have a DC of 10 + 1/2 the attack's level (item level for weapon attacks, or, if the attack wasn't made with a weapon, the' attacker's level or CR); skill checks have a DC of 15 + 1-1/2 the level of the attack.<br />• Any effect that requires an Engineering check to fix a weapon uses Mysticism if the weapon is a magic item; or Medicine if the attack was made without a weapon.<br />• Effects that scale by level use a weapon's item level, a spell's caster level, or a character's level or CR for all other effects. Round fractions up.<br />• An effect based on a spell uses the attacker's character level or CR for any calculaffon not defined an the card.<br />• The save DC for an effect triggered by a PC is equal to 10+ 1/2 the level of the attack (see above) + the PC's key ability score. For an NPC, the save DC is based on the ability DC of the appropriate array and CR (Alien Archive 129-131).<br />• An effect that uses the name of an existing critical hit effect (Starfinder Core Rulebook 182) follows the rules for that critical hit effect.<br />• An effect that lasts \"until healed\" ends once the recipient receives healing equal to the damage dealt by the attack. •<br />If a critical fumble says to reroll the attack, use the same attack bonus as the fumbled attack, and deal full damage if the new attack hits the target. </p>\n<p> </p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a &ldquo;progression track.&rdquo; @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} use the relevant </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison} </span> track (for example, </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}</span> that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.ezl3X0BH5JzLbZaX]{Curses}</span> generally do not use progression tracks&mdash;their effects continue until they&rsquo;re cured without progressing through stages.<br /><br />Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction&rsquo;s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} along to others if it&rsquo;s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. On a failed save, if the victim was affected by a condition as a result of the affliction and that condition was removed (such as by remove condition), the victim regains any conditions from earlier steps along the affliction&rsquo;s progression track (as well as conditions from the current step). A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug&rsquo;s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug} acts as a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease} (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).<br /><br />Each progression track has an end state&mdash;a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn&rsquo;t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.<br /><br /><strong>Curing an Affliction</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease&rsquo;s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs} work differently&mdash;fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison's} duration) removes a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison} from the victim&rsquo;s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} might require a longer recovery period.<br /><br />@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.ezl3X0BH5JzLbZaX]{Curses} can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.<br /><br />Usually, the spell <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction} </em>immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.i3lpfndXeLq85h12]{Miracle} </em>or <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.i4KITExV7vMeoM24]{Wish}</em>, or in the most extreme cases, <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.AHfzMTHx9PI4Z4zn]{Reincarnate}</em> or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Types</h2>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.ezl3X0BH5JzLbZaX]{Curses}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}</h3>\n<h3>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}</h3>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

However, only a patient demolitionist with the proper training can blow the lid off a crate without scratching the contents, collapse a bridge at an opportune moment, or vaporize a wall to launch a devastating surprise attack.</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Core Rulebook lays out basic rules for arming and activating explosives on pages 141 and 218, though the installation speed and grenade payload better represent an anti-personnel trap than one meant to inflict structural damage. Even a typical door’s hardness and Hit Points are enough to withstand most grenades, making the ordnance required to break a door fairly cost-prohibitive. Anyone who wants to inflict property damage, such as to a door or wall, is better off using the optional demolitions system presented here, along with the expanded rules for the assess stability task of the Engineering skill found in the sidebar on page 69.</p>\n<h2>Demolitions</h2>\n<p>You can use Engineering to arm explosive charges (page 69) that you can trigger later with a detonator (Core Rulebook 218). Applying an explosive charge to a surface typically takes 1 minute, plus 1 minute to program its detonator; this is the primary charge. You can also apply up to five secondary charges to the surface; this takes an additional minute per charge, and each secondary charge must be the same type and mark as the primary charge. After you set the charges, the GM rolls your Engineering check in secret, so you’re not sure how effective your explosive charges are. You gain a circumstance bonus to your Engineering check based on your primary explosive charge’s mark, and the bonus increases by 2 for each secondary charge applied to the surface. The total result can’t exceed the primary charge’s Maximum Result (see Table 2–17: Explosive Charges on this page). The Engineering check DC to disable this explosive is equal to the result of this Engineering check minus the bonuses from secondary charges.</p>\n<p>When you activate the detonator, the charges explode; this functions as a Strength check to break the structure (Core Rulebook 409) that uses your Engineering check’s result in place of the Strength roll. If the check is successful, the explosion breaks apart the structure, allowing movement through its space and preventing it from being closed again (such as for a door). On a success, the explosion also causes collateral damage, dealing fire and piercing damage equal to twice the explosive charge’s mark to all creatures and objects adjacent to the structure (Reflex for half) and filling the damaged area with dust and smoke that grants concealment for 1 round. For every 5 by which the Engineering check exceeds the break DC, the damaging explosion’s radius increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 5 additional feet × the charge’s mark) and its damage increases by an amount equal to the explosive charge’s mark. The total collateral damage can’t exceed the structure’s break DC.</p>\n<p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, the explosion doesn’t harm the structure. If you fail the check by 9 or less, the explosion deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 item levels of the primary explosive charge (rounded up) to the structure; if the demolitions included secondary charges, each one increases the damage by 1d6 (or 2d6 if the secondary charges’ item levels are 10 or higher). If you fail the check by 4 or less, this damage also ignores half the structure’s hardness.</p>\n<p><strong>Controlled Explosion:</strong> When applying explosive charges, you can take a –4 penalty to your Engineering check to limit the subsequent damage, allowing for precise explosions. Choose a number. If your Engineering check result when setting explosive charges exceeds this number, the result is instead reduced to this number.</p>\n<p><strong>Embedded Charges:</strong> Through a combination of careful calculation and drilling holes in the surface to accommodate charges, you can maximize an explosion’s destructive potential. This process takes 10 minutes per charge, 5 minutes per charge of which requires the use of a laser torch (Starfinder Armory 105). As you finish setting the charges, attempt an Engineering check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the primary charge’s item level). If you succeed and all charges used in an explosion are embedded in this way, apply a +2 circumstance bonus to the demolition’s Engineering check; the explosive charges’ maximum result increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Demolitions: </strong>You can halve the time it takes to apply explosive charges, but doing so applies a –5 penalty to your Engineering check to determine the explosion’s result.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Abilities and effects that allow you to increase the rate at which you arm explosives also apply to the demolitions task. If you have an ability that reduces the time required for a specific action (such as the demolition expert envoy expertise talent, Armory 145), you can take that action to arm a single charge.</p>\n<h2>Assess Stability (Engineering)</h2>\n<p>The following expands on the assess stability task on page 141 of the Core Rulebook, adding the ability to evaluate a structure. To do so, you must be within 30 feet of the structure and able to perceive it with a precise sense, or you must have access to detailed schematics. The base DC of this check is 15, modified by any circumstances such as the structure’s complexity or structure. If you succeed, you determine one of the following statistics, plus an additional statistic for every 5 by which you exceed the DC: the structure’s break DC, its hardness, or its Hit Points. If you fail the check, you can retry it after 24 hours.</p>","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"N2OOHGUasI1y9Hbj","name":"Damage Reduction (DR)","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some creatures have the ability to instantly heal damage from attacks or ignore blows altogether; this is referred to as the damage reduction special ability. Damage reduction (DR) applies to kinetic damage—any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—that a character takes, regardless of that damage’s source. It does not apply against damage with no damage type or any other damage type, including acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, though these can be mitigated by energy resistance (see page 264).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage the creature ignores from each attack. Weapons made from a certain material, magic weapons (any weapon with a weapon fusion; see page 191), and weapons imbued with a specific alignment often can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/cold iron means that you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not made from cold iron, DR 5/magic means you take 5 fewer damage from weapons that are not magic, and so on. If a dash follows the slash (“DR 5/—”), then the damage reduction is effective against bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from any weapon, though some attacks have their own ability to overcome DR. Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with a magic fusion or alignment is treated as a magic weapon or having the listed alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Sometimes, multiple types of weapon materials or alignments are indicated after the value of DR, indicating that the damage reduction can be overcome in multiple ways or requires a specific combination of effects to be overcome. For example, DR 5/lawful or magic means any weapon that is of a lawful alignment or that is magic can overcome the damage reduction. In contrast, DR 5/lawful and magic means only weapons that are both of a lawful alignment and magic overcome the damage reduction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an injury-based disease, an operative’s debilitating trick, and poison delivered via an injury. Damage reduction does not negate ability damage, ability drain, energy damage dealt as part of an attack, or negative levels, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.

{"_id":"PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD","name":"Defining Effects","content":"<p><sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Source </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 268</span></sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Whether an effect is created by a class feature, spell, or piece of equipment, it usually has factors such as area, duration, and range that are defined using specific game terms, as well as descriptors that indicate its type of power (and that sometimes affect how it works). The following section describes how effects&rsquo; areas, descriptors, durations, ranges, and targets work, and it also gives the mechanical definition of line of effect and line of sight&mdash;two factors key to determining whether a character can use a spell or piece of equipment effectively.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects cover a defined area. Sometimes an effect&rsquo;s description indicates a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories discussed below. Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point from which the effect originates, but otherwise you don&rsquo;t control which creatures or objects are affected. The point of origin of an effect is always a grid intersection, meaning the point where four squares touch on a tactical battle map.<br /><br />When determining whether a given creature is within the area of an effect, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares, just as you would do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you must count from intersection to intersection. You can count diagonally across a square, but keep in mind that every second diagonal counts as two squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the effect&rsquo;s area, everything within that square is within the effect&rsquo;s area. If the effect&rsquo;s area touches only the near edge of a square, however, things within that square are unaffected by the effect. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Burst, Emanation, Or Spread</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most effects with an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the effect&rsquo;s point of origin and measure its area from that point. </span></p>\n<h3>Burst</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A burst effect applies to whatever is in its area when it comes into effect, including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see. It doesn&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from the burst&rsquo;s point of origin, and its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners. The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst effects are specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin the effect extends. </span></p>\n<h3>Emanation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An emanation effect functions like a burst, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the effect. Most emanations are cones or spheres. </span></p>\n<h3>Spread</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A spread effect extends out like a burst, but it can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the effect spreads out to a given distance in all directions. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see. Calculate distance using the actual distance the effect travels, taking into account turns the effect takes and counting around walls and corners, not through them. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see page 271) to the entirety of the effect&rsquo;s area. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Cone, Cylinder, Line, Or Sphere</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most effects with an area have a particular shape. </span></p>\n<h3>Cone</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A cone-shaped effect extends away from you in a quartercircle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and grows wider as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around corners. </span></p>\n<h3>Cylinder</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">With cylinder-shaped effects, you select the effect&rsquo;s point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle at a height designated in the effect&rsquo;s description, and the effect drops down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped effect ignores any obstructions within its area. </span></p>\n<h3>Line</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A line-shaped effect extends away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect (see page 271). A line-shaped effect applies to all creatures in squares through which the line passes. </span></p>\n<h3>Sphere</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A sphere-shaped effect expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres can be bursts, emanations, or spreads. </span></p>\n<h3>Shapable (S)</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an area or effect entry ends with &ldquo;(S),&rdquo; you can shape the effect. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. The &ldquo;areas&rdquo; of many effects are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular or three-dimensional shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define areas and effects in space. </span></p>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect can have a unique area, as defined in its description. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Areas With Targets</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have areas that target creatures or objects within the specified area. Unlike for targeted effects (see Target on page 272), you do not get to select which creatures are affected; the effect affects all creatures or objects of some kind in the specified area.<br /><br />If an effect restricts which targets are affected (for example, it affects only living creatures), then creatures in the effect&rsquo;s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the number of creatures affected. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Subjects Of Effects</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an effect targets creatures or objects directly, the result travels with the subjects for the effect&rsquo;s duration. If an effect targets an area, it stays within that area for its duration; creatures become subject to the effect when they enter the area but are no longer subject to it when they leave.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Descriptors</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A descriptor is a term that helps define an item, a spell, or another effect in some way. Some effects have more than one descriptor, each of which further refines the ways the effect works and interacts with the world around it, while others have none. Even equipment sometimes has descriptors.<br /><br />The descriptors are as follows: acid, air, calling, chaotic, charm, cold, compulsion, creation, curse, darkness, death, disease, earth, electricity, emotion, evil, fear, fire, force, good, healing, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, pain, poison, radiation, scrying, sense-dependent, shadow, sonic, summoning, teleportation, and water.<br /><br />Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves; they instead describe how spells or effects interact with certain other spells or effects. Some descriptors provide additional information about how the effect to which they are attached operates, as defined below. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Calling</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A calling effect transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The effect grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the effect might limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called die if they are killed on the new plane. A called creature can&rsquo;t be dispelled, even if it was called by magical means. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Charm</h3>\n<p>A charm effect changes how the subject views you. This gives you the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to another creature, but its servitude is not absolute or mindless. Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.<br /><br />A charmed creature retains its original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that it now regards the person who charmed it as a dear friend and gives great weight to that character&rsquo;s suggestions and directions. A charmed creature does not volunteer information or tactics that its master doesn&rsquo;t ask for. A charmed creature never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to it.<br /><br />A creature fights friends it had before being charmed only if they threaten its new friend. Even then, it uses the least lethal means at its disposal, for it wishes to resolve the conflict without causing real harm.<br /><br />A charmed creature can attempt an opposed Charisma check against its master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make it do something it wouldn&rsquo;t normally do even for a close friend. If it succeeds at this check, it decides not to go along with that particular order but remains charmed. If the creature&rsquo;s master commands it to perform an action that the creature would be vehemently opposed to, it can attempt a new saving throw to break free of its master&rsquo;s influence altogether.<br /><br />If a charmed creature is openly attacked by the character who charmed it or by that character&rsquo;s apparent allies, it is automatically freed of the spell or effect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Compulsion</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A compulsion effect overrides the subject&rsquo;s free will in some way, forcing the subject to act in some manner or changing the way its mind works. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Creation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creation effect manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the creator designates. If the effect has a duration other than instantaneous, magic or some other energy holds the creation together, but when the duration ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the effect has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature does not depend on any outside energy for its existence, so it lasts indefinitely once created.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Force</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A force effect deals full damage to incorporeal creatures and blocks their movement. It also blocks the sense through ability.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Language-Dependent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A language-dependent effect uses intelligible language (either audible, visual, or telepathic) as a medium for communication. If you cannot communicate with the target or the target cannot understand what you are communicating, the effect fails to affect that target. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Mind-Affecting</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A mind-affecting effect works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Pain</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A pain effect causes unpleasant sensations but not permanent physical damage. Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fortitude save are immune to pain effects. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Scrying</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A scrying effect creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information while the effect lasts. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same sensory abilities that you have naturally, but not any sensory abilities you gain from other spells or technology. The sensor is a separate, independent source of sensory input for you, and thus it functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened or otherwise suffer sensory impairment.<br /><br />A creature can notice a scrying sensor with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the spell or effect&rsquo;s level). The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell. Lead sheeting, force fields, and some exotic materials and magical protections block scrying effects; if that is the case, you can sense that the effect has been blocked. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Sense-Dependent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A sense-dependent effect has either audible or visual elements, requiring sight or hearing to have any effect. For this kind of effect to affect that target, you must be able to either see or hear the target, and the target must be able to either see or hear you. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Shadow</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A shadow effect creates something that is partially real from an amalgamation of extradimensional energy. Damage dealt by a shadow effect is real. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Summoning</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A summoning effect instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the effect ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from (typically another plane, but not always), but a summoned object is not sent back unless the effect description specifically indicates otherwise. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its Hit Points drop to 0, but it is not really @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform in the place from which it was summoned, during which time it can&rsquo;t be summoned again.<br /><br />When a summoning effect ends and the summoned creature disappears, all spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Teleportation</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A teleportation effect involves instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane (see page 471). Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation unless the specific effect notes otherwise, and teleportation effects work within the Drift.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect&rsquo;s duration tells you how long the effect lasts. If a spell, ability, or item has a specific duration and creates one or more effects, those effects last for the duration unless the specific effect notes otherwise.<br /><br />Sometimes an effect is suppressed without being negated or dispelled. When this happens, the effect&rsquo;s duration is unchanged. It still ends at the same time it would have ended if it had not been suppressed. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Timed Durations</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Durations are usually measured in rounds, minutes, hours, days, or other increments. When the time of the effect&rsquo;s duration is up, the energy or force empowering the effect goes away and the effect ends. If an effect&rsquo;s duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly by the GM so you don&rsquo;t know how long the effect will last.<br /><br />Whenever an effect&rsquo;s duration is expressed in a standard unit that measures time, such as hours, days, or even years, it refers to those units as expressed in Pact Standard Time. Under this scheme, a day has 24 hours of 60 minutes each, and a year has 365 days (or 52 weeks). For more information about time and similar concepts in Starfinder, see Time on page 430. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Instantaneous</h3>\n<p>The effect comes and goes the instant it is created, though its consequences might last longer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Permanent</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The effect remains until is undone through some method, such as by <em>dispel magic</em> for permanent spells. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Concentration</h3>\n<p>When an effect has a duration of concentration, the effect lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain an effect is a standard action. Any factor that could break your concentration while you are performing activities that require focus (such as casting a spell) can also break your concentration while you&rsquo;re maintaining an effect, causing the effect to end. See Concentration and Interrupted Spells on page 331 for more details. You can neither use an effect that requires concentration nor cast a spell while concentrating on an effect. Some effects last for a short time after you cease concentrating&mdash;typically 1 round per level, though individual effects may vary as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Discharge</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Occasionally an effect lasts for a set duration, or until it is triggered or discharged. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Touch Effects And Holding The Charge</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, most notably spells, have a range of touch (see Range below) and require an action to activate. In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t discharge a touch effect on the round you create it, you can postpone the discharge of the effect (also known as holding the charge) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round until the effect is discharged. If you make any other attack, activate another ability, or cast a spell during this time, the touch effect dissipates.<br /><br />Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Dismissible (D)</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If the duration of a spell or effect ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss the effect at will as a standard action. You must be within range of the effect and be able to fulfill the same conditions required to create the effect&mdash;such as being able to concentrate to cast a spell or having access to the equipment that created the effect&mdash; though you do not actually need to spend the appropriate action. An effect that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the effect is to stop concentrating on your turn.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line Of Effect</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If a weapon, spell, ability, or item requires an attack roll and has a range measured in feet, it normally requires that you (or whoever or whatever is using the ability) have a line of effect to the target to be effective (subject to GM discretion). A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what an attack or ability can affect. A line of effect is blocked by a solid barrier that can stop the effect in question (such as a wall, for most effects), but it is not blocked by purely visual restrictions (such as smoke or darkness). You cannot have line of effect that exceeds planetary range, unless otherwise indicated.<br /><br />You must have a clear line of effect to any creature or object you wish to target or to any space in which you wish to create an effect without an area. For effects with an area, you must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of the effect. An effect that is a burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation affects only an area, creature, or object within line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s starting point, the center point of a cylinder&rsquo;s circle, or an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin). For definitions of these specific terms, see Area on page 268.<br /><br />If you have a line of effect to some of a target&rsquo;s space but not all of it, the target has cover (see pages 253&ndash;254 for more information about cover). Additionally, an otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it may grant cover rather than total cover against an effect, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line Of Sight</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Line of sight is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what you can see. Line of sight is like line of effect, except factors that limit normal vision, such as fog, darkness, and total concealment, can block line of sight. If you can&rsquo;t see a target for any reason, you do not have line of sight to it, and thus you cannot use effects that require you to have line of sight. You cannot have line of sight that exceeds planetary range unless otherwise indicated.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect&rsquo;s range indicates how far from you it can reach. An effect&rsquo;s range is the maximum distance from you that the effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can designate the effect&rsquo;s point of origin. If any portion of the effect&rsquo;s area would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. If a range is based on level, this means caster level for spells, class level for class features, and item level for weapons and equipment. Standard ranges include the following. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Personal</h3>\n<p>An effect with a range of personal is limited to and affects your person only.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Touch</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If an effect has a range of touch, you must touch a creature or object to affect your target, which requires you to hit with a melee attack roll (against EAC unless the effect says otherwise) if you are touching an unwilling target. A touch effect that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a weapon can. Some touch effects allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch up to six willing or unconscious targets as part of the activation of such an effect, but all targets of the effect must be touched in the same round that you finish activating the effect. If the effect allows you to touch targets over multiple rounds, touching up to six creatures is a full action. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Close</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of close reaches as far as 25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 levels you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Medium</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of medium reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per level you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Long</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of long reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per level you have. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Planetary</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of planetary can reach anywhere on the same planet. This also covers targets in orbit around the planet, such as moons and artificial satellites. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">System-Wide</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of system-wide can reach anywhere in the same solar system. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Plane</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An effect with a range of plane can reach anywhere in the same plane of existence. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Unlimited</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, mostly high-level spells, can reach anywhere, even onto other planes. Effects with ranges of unlimited are often very powerful, and they can be difficult or impossible to access until you reach a high level. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Range Expressed In Feet</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have no standard range category, just a range expressed in feet. In this case, the specific effect lists exactly how far its range extends. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Range Increment</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects, especially weapons, have a range increment. The weapon can generate an effect at many multiples of this range, but you take penalties if the target is more than one range increment away (see Range and Penalties on page 245).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Target</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some effects have a target or targets. You use these effects on creatures or objects, as defined by the effect itself. You must have line of effect (see page 271) to the target or targets of an effect you wish to use, and you must specifically choose the target or targets. If the effect takes a certain amount of time to activate (such as the casting time of a spell), you do not have to select your target or targets until you finish activating the effect.<br /><br />For example, if you decide to cast a spell that would affect multiple creatures, you need not choose exactly which creatures it affects until you are done casting it and the spell is about to go into effect. This allows you to avoid casting spells or imposing effects on creatures that might have been taken out of a fight or otherwise incapacitated in the interim between your decision to cast a spell and when you&rsquo;ve finished casting it and it&rsquo;s ready to take effect.<br /><br />Some effects restrict which targets can be selected. If an effect targets living creatures, it affects all creatures other than constructs and undead&mdash;in other words, biological or technobiological creatures that are alive. (Artificially created beings that are not undead or constructs are considered living for this purpose.) If an effect targets willing or unconscious targets, it affects only those creatures who wish to be affected by it. A creature can declare itself a willing target at any time (even if it&rsquo;s @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} or it isn&rsquo;t that creature&rsquo;s turn); this does not use up an action and simply requires, for example, a player to inform another player that his character is a willing target. Other effects allow you to target other categories of creatures or items, such as effects that can specifically target a construct, corpse, or object.<br /><br />Some effects allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you activate it. Redirecting an effect is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Effects With Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some targeted effects require an attack roll to hit their target. These effects can score critical hits just as weapons can, and when they do, they deal double damage on a critical hit.<br /><br />If a targeted effect that requires an attack roll lists a duration, it refers to how long the effect lasts on the target (if the attack roll is successful), not how long you have to make an attack.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Abilities And Spell Effects On Large Vehicles</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Most vehicles interact with abilities and spells normally; the effects of an explosive blast on an exploration buggy can be determined using the typical rules, for example.<br /><br />However, if you are on an exceptionally large vehicle, such as a sizable aircraft or a starship, the vehicle effectively becomes a type of terrain, and it interacts with the effects of abilities and spells differently. The GM is the final arbiter of what type of vehicle classifies as terrain, but examples include airships, mobile factory crawlers, ocean liners, space stations, starships, trains, or any vehicle larger than a typical creature that is size Colossal or larger.<br /><br />Consult the following guidelines when using abilities or casting spells on vehicles classified as terrain. For the purposes of abilities and spells, exceptionally large vehicles are not considered objects; instead, their various component parts (bulkheads, consoles, walls, etc.) are considered objects. In general, abilities or spells with a stationary or immovable effect (such as <em>wall of force</em>, <em>zone of truth</em>, or the entrance to an Akashic mystic&rsquo;s memory palace) or spells that are anchored to a vehicle (such as <em>wall of steel</em>) move with a vehicle and are not fixed to the physical spot where they are used or cast. In this way, effects that originate from a character on a terrain-sized vehicle and target an area on that vehicle move with the vehicle, instead of manifesting in a static spot that the vehicle quickly outpaces.<br /><br />Beyond these guidelines, the exact effects of an ability or spell that originates from a character on an exceptionally large vehicle are up to the GM.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"QHtKixa59DI9xQfO","name":"Radiation","content":"<h1>Radiation</h1>\n<p>Radiation is a very real threat to adventurers, whether it’s the radiation emitted from stars or the radiation generated by various technological wonders of the universe. Radiation is a poison effect (see page 414) that weakens an affected creature’s Constitution and can also inflict an affected creature with a disease called radiation sickness. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe. The effects of these categories of radiation are described on Table 11–8: Radiation Levels.</p>\n<h2>Area Of Effect</h2>\n<p>Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.</p>\n<h2>Curing Radiation Effects</h2>\n<p>A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting remove radioactivity has the same effect. As usual for poison effects, an affected creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. Remove affliction doesn’t cure a creature of the effects of radiation poisoning, but remove radioactivity does.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a creature has been exposed to enough radiation, it might contract radiation sickness, which acts like a noncontagious disease. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair. Radiation sickness can be treated like any disease, although it can’t be cured with remove affliction. Remove radioactivity can cure radiation sickness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Radiation (@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison effect})</h2>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>poison, emanation (see above); <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude (see chart)</p>\n<p><strong>Track </strong>Constitution; <strong>Frequency </strong>1/round</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>At each state of impaired and beyond, the victim must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or contract the radiation sickness disease (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>none</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Radiation Sickness (@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease effect})</h2>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude (same DC as the level of radiation that caused the radiation sickness)</p>\n<p><strong>Track </strong>physical; <strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Radiation sickness isn’t contagious.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>3 consecutive saves</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Radiation Levels</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Radiation Level</td>\n<td>Fortitude Save DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"RVk6hgUCq3SDfeCb","name":"Blindsense","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Blindsense is the ability to use an imprecise nonvisual sense (or a combination of senses; see page 260) to operate effectively without vision. Blindsense operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with blindsense typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsense entry in the creature’s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—say, for example, if a creature that uses sound to perceive through its blindsense becomes deaf—the creature loses access entirely to its blindsense. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsense can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have the blindsense special ability and succeed at a Perception check to notice an unseen creature, you become aware of the creature’s location.

This article builds on the existing Starfinder rules for hacking, creating a compatible, engaging subsystem that can include an entire party. Use traditional Computers checks for simple, low-pressure situations and employ this subsystem for more interactive hacking encounters—all in the same campaign!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style:italic\">HACKING IN SUMMARY</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Dynamic hacking follows these steps.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">1. Prepare: Participants configure their personas and decide </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">whether to be lead or support hackers before accessing </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">the computer.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">2. Present Obstacles: The GM lays out the initial obstacles </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">for the PCs to overcome. Each hacker can attempt one </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">check to assess an obstacle’s statistics.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">3. Countdown: Reduce the countdown value for each </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">obstacle by 1. Resolve any obstacle effects.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">4. Hackers Act: The next phase begins. The hackers act in </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">any order, using any of their full suite of options.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">5. Resolve Obstacles: For any of the obstacles whose </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Resolve entries have been fulfilled, set those obstacles </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">aside and apply any effects that occur when those </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">obstacles are resolved.</span><br style=\"font-style:italic\" /><span style=\"font-style:italic\">6. Continued Hacking: After each of the hackers has had a </span><span style=\"font-style:italic\">turn, repeat steps 3–5 until the encounter ends.</span></p>\n<p><br />Hacking in the Core Rulebook is straightforward, requiring just a Computers check to access a secured system and avoid countermeasures, sometimes with an additional Computers check to overcome the occasional fake shell or firewall.</p>\n<p>Dynamic hacking involves three key differences. First, a hacking encounter spans multiple phases, during which the hacker can pursue various objectives. Second, a hacker splits their Computers skill into several specializations (Deceive, Hack, and Process), used in place of the Computers modifier during the encounter. Finally, multiple hackers can contribute to dynamic hacking—even PCs with limited technical skills.</p>\n<p>Dynamic hacking functions with existing rules and encounters with minimal adaptation. Rules and guidelines for using this system with existing character options appear on page 73.</p>\n<h2>COMPUTERS SUBSKILLS</h2>\n<p>In dynamic hacking, the Computers skill is broken into three subskills used for various tasks: Deceive, Hack, and Process. <strong>Deceive</strong> represents your ability to hide or misrepresent your identity to avoid detection, confound foes, and trick your way past safeguards. <strong>Hack</strong> represents your prowess to manipulate programs, exploit vulnerabilities, and brute-force your way into a computer’s files. <strong>Process</strong> represents your ability to identify threats and opportunities, as well as change, sustain, defend, or repair your own programs. Your modifier for each of these subskills equals your Computers skill modifier, plus any modifiers based on how you configure your hacking persona (see below).</p>\n<h2>DIGITAL PERSONA</h2>\n<p>While hacking into a computer, you navigate and manipulate its systems through a persona, which is your anchor in that digital world. The persona’s simply a bundle of code through which you act, though you can give it a sensory signature that others perceive when interacting with it. However, your persona is also a target through which others can attack you, track your location, and expel you from the digital space.</p>\n<p><strong>Persona Health:</strong> Countermeasures might attack your persona, degrading its performance or even using the persona to attack you and your equipment more directly. Your persona’s overall health is measured by Connection Points (CP), with lost CP representing damage that impairs performance and connectivity. Your digital persona has a maximum number of CP equal to 12 + 2 × your Computers ranks. You can restore lost CP with the repair action (page 72), and you replenish all lost CP when you spend 1 Resolve Point and take 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>Your persona malfunctions as it loses CP. When your persona’s current CP is at or below 75% of its maximum, randomly select one of your three Computers subskills and apply a –2 penalty to your checks with that subskill. When your persona’s CP is at or below 50% of its maximum, apply that –2 penalty to your checks with the other two subskills. Increase the penalty to –3 when your persona’s CP falls to or below 25% of its maximum. If its CP total ever drops to 0, your persona disintegrates, and you and any support hackers linked to your persona are immediately ejected from the encounter and can’t rejoin until you’ve restored your persona’s current CP to 1 or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuring a Persona:</strong> When you begin a hacking encounter, you configure your persona, assigning a circumstance modifier between –3 and +3 to each of the three subskills: Deceive, Hack, and Process. The sum of these modifiers can’t exceed your number of Computers ranks divided by 3. If you have your own computer (Core Rulebook 213), you can harness its power to enhance your persona, in which case the three circumstance modifiers’ sum above can’t exceed your computer’s tier.</p>\n<p>In addition, you decide whether your persona will act independently or will aid an allied hacker’s persona, establishing whether you are a lead hacker or support hacker.</p>\n<p><em>Lead Hacker:</em> This hacker can perform a major action and a minor action during each phase (action types appear on page 72). In turn, they are vulnerable to countermeasures’ effects. At least one lead hacker must be present to begin a hacking encounter, and any number of lead hackers can participate.</p>\n<p><em>Support Hacker: </em>This hacker’s persona is connected to that of an allied lead hacker. Support hackers are rarely affected directly by countermeasures and can make greater use of non-Computers skills, but they can perform only one minor action each turn. If their lead hacker leaves the encounter, any connected support hackers also leave the encounter.</p>\n<h2>BEGINNING AND ENDING THE ENCOUNTER</h2>\n<p>A hacking encounter begins when one or more users access a secured computer by either directly accessing the computer’s user interface (like a terminal), physically accessing a computer using a hacking kit, or attempting to break into the computer through an infosphere or similar network. Once they begin, the hackers typically work against a timer, as most countermeasures have countdowns that represent how quickly they react to intruders. The encounter continues so long as at least one hacker accesses the computer; however, a GM might end the encounter once a hacker has secured root access or resolved all countermeasures, either of which ends the encounter’s remaining threat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Hacking Phases</strong></h3>\n<p>Much like physical combat, dynamic hacking takes place in phases, during which hackers and automated defenses take turns acting within a digital space. The hackers always act first in a phase, after which the computer’s defenses resolve any of their effects. Each phase, hackers can perform an assortment of actions, including major actions that cause substantial effects and minor actions that focus more on observation, commands, and support. Any lead hacker can perform one major action and one minor action per turn, whereas a support hacker can perform only a minor action per turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus Actions: </strong>At the start of their turn, a hacker can choose to perform additional actions. A lead hacker can choose to take up to three additional major actions during their turn, but they take a cumulative –5 penalty to all skill checks they attempt during their turn for each additional major action taken. A support hacker can choose to take a major action instead of a minor action by spending 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<h2>HACKING OBJECTIVES</h2>\n<p>Objectives represent a combination of goals and obstacles that a hacker overcomes during a hacking encounter. An encounter typically begins with several objectives, and additional objectives appear over the course of the encounter. These objectives are divided into three categories based on their lead function, and sample objectives appear on page 73.</p>\n<p><strong>Countermeasures:</strong> These objectives represent deliberate defenses that pose some risk to hackers. They range from alarms and contingent computer viruses to live counterhackers attempting to stymie intruders.</p>\n<p><strong>Modules:</strong> These objectives are programs that typically have value to the hackers—and are usually the reason for hacking in the first place—such as command modules that control doors or data modules that contain valuable intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Nodes: </strong>These objectives are figurative branches within the computer that provide access to other objectives beyond. Reaching modules often requires traversing one or more nodes.</p>\n<h3>Objective Statistics</h3>\n<p>Objectives typically include a name, a description, and the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Check DC:</strong> This is the base DC of skill checks for interacting with this obstacle. An obstacle’s check DC equals either 15 + 1-1/2 × the encounter’s CR or 15 + 3 × the computer’s tier. Specific checks and actions often include modifiers that adjust this value.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolve: </strong>This lists the way or ways a hacker might overcome the objective. A Resolve entry lists the checks required, the number of successes required for each check, and any modifier to the base DC for those checks. For example, an obstacle with a Check DC of 18 that lists Hack (DC + 0, 2 successes) and Process (DC – 2, 1 success) as its Resolve entry requires two successful DC 18 Hack checks and one successful DC 16 Process check to overcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Support:</strong> This lists any alternate skills a hacker can use when performing the aid action to assist another hacker in overcoming the obstacle.</p>\n<p><strong>Countdown:</strong> This is a timer that triggers special conditions after a certain number of phases, listed in parentheses; some obstacles’ Countdowns are rolled randomly when the obstacle appears. At the end of each hacking phase, reduce this number by 1. If the number is ever reduced to 0, the listed effect occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> This is any special effect that happens once the objective has been resolved.</p>\n<p><strong>Special: </strong>This is any additional effect the obstacle creates.</p>\n<h2>DYNAMIC HACKING ENCOUNTERS</h2>\n<p>Hacking encounters vary to reflect the hackers’ goals and the target computer’s capabilities. Each encounter includes at least one objective tied to the hacker’s goal (such as secret data to steal or a door to open), at least one countermeasure that opposes the hacker, and often, one or more nodes that create avenues the hackers must navigate toward their goals.</p>\n<p>To build an encounter, set the encounter’s Challenge Rating— which sets the encounter’s check DC (page 71)—and decide on an approximate encounter length based on the number of checks required to resolve the key objectives. A short encounter requires about 5–7 successful checks to resolve the main objectives, whereas longer encounters might require 10–15 checks. For each lead hacker involved, add enough countermeasures to increase the number of checks by 2 (for shorter encounters) or by as much as 4 for longer encounters. For each support hacker, increase the number of checks by 1.</p>\n<p>Scaling an encounter in this way need not always involve adding more countermeasures but could instead involve requiring an additional success to resolve specific objectives. This way, even if more PCs join the encounter as lead hackers than you anticipated, you can easily adjust the encounter to provide a fairly similar challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Timed Encounters: </strong>In Starfinder, successfully accessing a system often affords the hacker time to explore at leisure. While a dynamic hack attempt might include finite countermeasures and a clear win condition, the format also supports hackers clashing with an array of defenses that multiply faster than the PCs can deactivate them. In this case, the goal becomes resolving enough countermeasures to stay safe, accomplish the mission, and escape before being overwhelmed or detected.</p>\n<h2>ADAPTING HACKING ABILITIES</h2>\n<p>The following are guidelines for adapting existing class features and character options to the dynamic hacking system.</p>\n<p><strong>Faster Hacking: </strong>An ability that reduces the time it takes to hack instead reduces the penalty a lead hacker takes when performing additional major actions to –3 per additional action.</p>\n<p><strong>Delay Countermeasures: </strong>An ability that would delay a countermeasure’s activation instead increases that countermeasure’s starting countdown value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Negate Countermeasures: </strong>Abilities that would negate a countermeasure entirely instead grant that character a +10 bonus to their first check to resolve the countermeasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> Features that increase the check DC to hack your own computer instead apply their bonus to your checks made to resist any effect that would harm your computer or persona.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"TN4VeY75Z2Ce8IT7","name":"Settlements","content":"<p>Any place where sentient life gathers, lives, and works on a regular basis is referred to as a settlement, and they are just as varied as the types of life-forms that occupy them. Presented on the following pages is a streamlined way to refer to settlements in the Starfinder RPG&mdash;stat blocks that quickly list the vital data for a settlement.<br /><br />For particularly large inhabited places, multiple settlement stat blocks can be used to represent distinct districts or neighborhoods. GMs should feel free to add new qualities to create the settlements they desire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Settlement Stat Blocks</h3>\n<p>A settlement stat block usually begins with a brief description, often noting where it is located. A settlement stat block is organized as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: The settlement&rsquo;s name is presented first.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment and Type</strong>: A settlement&rsquo;s alignment is the general alignment of its citizens and government, though individuals who dwell therein can still be of any alignment. A settlement&rsquo;s type is a term that generally classifies the settlement, such as &ldquo;space station&rdquo; or &ldquo;trading post.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Population</strong>: This number represents the settlement&rsquo;s average population; the exact number is flexible. In addition, a breakdown of the settlement&rsquo;s racial mix is listed in parentheses after the population.</li>\n<li><strong>Government</strong>: This entry lists how the settlement is governed and ruled.</li>\n<li><strong>Qualities</strong>: This entry lists the unusual qualities that make the settlement unique.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum Item Level</strong>: Items of this level or lower are generally available for purchase in this settlement. Maximum item level isn&rsquo;t always directly related to a settlement&rsquo;s size, as even a small city can be home to a black market or gifted engineers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Examples Of Settlement Governments</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.Ims0eV8mfXFQMCx9]{Settlement Governments}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Examples Of Settlement Qualities</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.CsrOFlvFJB0zY3Vb]{Settlement Qualities}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Settlement Technology</h2>\n<p>Most urban areas are centers of commerce and entertainment bustling with activity. The amenities of city living are usually made possible by technology, whether it&rsquo;s cutting-edge devices or barely functioning older models. Technology is used in just about everything, from high-end security systems to simple signs and vending machines. Most technology found in settlements can be broken down into the following four categories.</p>\n<h3>Civil</h3>\n<p>Civil technology includes anything installed by a government to be part of an area&rsquo;s infrastructure. Streetlights, public transportation, mail-delivery drones, automated street sweepers, and more make up this category of technology. As a great number of people usually rely on the services this kind of technology provides, it is often better protected. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of civil technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 23.</p>\n<h3>Commercial</h3>\n<p>Commercial technology is often mass-produced and is used by private citizens and most businesses. This category includes personal communication devices, game consoles, most security cameras and electronic door controls, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of commercial technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 18.</p>\n<h3>Restricted</h3>\n<p>Whether owned by the military or a massive corporation, restricted technology is some of the most advanced and hardest to hack. This category includes private servers, weapon prototypes, high-end security systems and alarms, and much more. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of restricted technology with the Computers or Engineering skill is 30.</p>\n<h3>Custom</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The pervasiveness of technology goes hand in hand with the ability to tweak and alter that technology. Engineers build custom refits for vehicles, and hackers jailbreak personal communication devices to do things the original creators never intended. Custom technology can be any piece of technology described above but with numerous modifications that make hacking or disabling it much trickier. The DC to disable or hack into an average piece of custom technology with the Computers or Survival skill varies, but it might be as high as 40.</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg","name":"Armor","content":"<p><sub><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 196</span></sub></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor is usually the easiest and most cost-effective way for creatures to protect themselves. Whether you are skimming through space aboard a mercenary vessel, attending a diplomatic meeting on a space station, or descending to a planet&rsquo;s surface to explore, armor provides you with protection against attacks and hostile environments.<br /><br />Modern armor is made of many different substances, including carbon fiber, ceramic, fabric, metal, and polymers. Most are constructed from a combination of materials, and some even use archaic materials such as animal hide. Creatures wear armor to protect themselves, but also to express their personal style.<br /><br />Most suits of armor consist of a helmet, gloves, boots, and a bodysuit that offers head-to-toe protection. Unless otherwise specified, the boots include a functionality that can anchor your feet to a solid surface in a zero-gravity environment, allowing you to orient yourself or return to normal footing when needed (for more about moving in zero-g, see page 402). </span></p>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Wearing Armor</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A character&rsquo;s class and feats determine what kinds of armor they can wear. Further details about wearing armor are below. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you are wearing armor with which you are not proficient, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to both EAC and KAC (see page 240). A character who is proficient only with light armor can wear heavier armor effectively by selecting the Heavy Armor Proficiency feat. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Donning Armor</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The time required to don or remove armor depends on its type. Light armor requires 4 rounds to don or remove, while heavy armor requires 16 rounds to don or remove.<br /><br />Armor that is at least 8th level but less than 16th level takes half the normal time to don or remove. Armor of 16th level or higher takes one-quarter the normal time to don or remove, to a minimum of one full action.<br /><br />Modern suits of armor are designed so that you can don or remove armor without assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Don Hastily</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">You can hastily don armor in half the normal time, to a minimum of one full action. The armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 worse than normal. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Armor Size</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor comes in different sizes for different creatures, and you might have to adjust a suit of armor to fit you if it wasn&rsquo;t made for your race. A ysoki can&rsquo;t effectively wear armor made for a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}, and a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} needs to adjust armor that was made for a two-armed creature. If it&rsquo;s in doubt whether a creature can fit the suit, the GM decides whether the armor needs to be adjusted. When you buy armor new, the purchase price includes any adjustments. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Adjusting Armor</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you get secondhand armor that wasn&rsquo;t tailored for you, you can have it adjusted, which requires a successful Engineering check (DC = 10 + 2 &times; the armor&rsquo;s level). Alternatively, you can spend 10% of the armor&rsquo;s purchase price to have it adjusted by a professional&mdash;typically an armorsmith or anyone with multiple ranks in Engineering. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Environmental Protections</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all armors protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor force field specially attuned to pressure and temperature that does not reduce damage from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals. The most common environmental dangers are detailed in Environment beginning on page 394. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Activation and Duration</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A suit of armor&rsquo;s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to its item level. Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes a standard action if you are wearing the suit (assuming the armor was properly donned). If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a helpless creature, you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action, but turning it off requires a Computers check to hack the system, treating the suit as a computer with a tier equal to half the suit&rsquo;s item level (the base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier).<br /><br />The duration of a suit&rsquo;s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an environment recharging station (publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of the recharging stations that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells (see page 234), also recharge armor&rsquo;s environmental protections, and using them to recharge suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no duration remaining still work normally. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Breathing and Pressure</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">All armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres (including any airborne poison or @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Disease}). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a corrosive atmosphere (see page 395) to prevent suffocation, but it isn&rsquo;t strong enough to prevent a corrosive atmosphere from dealing acid damage to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid damage taken from a corrosive atmosphere normally. Any vision impairment from the environment (such as smoke or water) still applies. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Radiation</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor protects you against low levels of radiation (see page 403) and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. Armor of 7th level and higher grants immunity to medium radiation levels and provides a +6 circumstance bonus to saving throws against higher levels of radiation. No armor&rsquo;s bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that caused you to contract it. </span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Temperature</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Armor&rsquo;s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both cold (temperatures as low as &ndash;20&deg; F) and heat (temperatures as high as 140&deg; F). This prevents you from having to attempt most Fortitude saving throws to avoid damage from the environment, and it prevents you from taking damage from breathing in most environments. This does not protect against cold or fire damage from other sources or against environments that deal damage without allowing a Fortitude saving throw or breathing the atmosphere (such as lava).)</span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"dXoXgaKcx2ZfBD4M","name":"Vehicle Tactical Rules","content":"<p><sub>Source CRB&nbsp; pg. 278</sub></p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in a vehicle fleeing from enemies who are on foot, or you&rsquo;re on foot yourselves trying to stop a vehicle, movement and combat are represented on a grid, such as a battle map. Different rules apply to chases between vehicles, since they involve much greater distances (see page 282).<br /><br />Vehicles are objects, so they don&rsquo;t have actions or reactions of their own&mdash;they must be piloted by a character or an AI autopilot (see page 280). However, they might still move when uncontrolled (see page 280). In some cases, a vehicle&rsquo;s item level affects the DC of the pilot&rsquo;s or passengers&rsquo; skill checks or otherwise factors into how these rules work. See pages 228&ndash;229 for the statistics of specific vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Vehicle Heading</h1>\n<p>Which direction creatures are facing on a grid is generally irrelevant in Starfinder, but vehicles aren&rsquo;t as nimble, so you need to monitor a vehicle&rsquo;s heading each time it moves. If you&rsquo;re using miniatures, rotate the vehicle&rsquo;s miniature to face the correct direction whenever its heading changes. The vehicle has to face toward one of the edges of its space, not toward a corner.<br /><br />When a vehicle has to move at its current heading (such as during a race action or when uncontrolled), it has to move in a straight line. This line is measured from the center of the vehicle on its front edge, and it can be straight ahead or at an angle, as shown in the diagram on page 279. The angle can&rsquo;t be greater than 45 degrees diagonally from the heading.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Piloting a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re piloting a vehicle during a combat on a grid, the vehicle moves on your initiative count and you have to spend your actions to pilot it. Creatures can take the following actions to drive or interact with vehicles, in addition to the normal combat actions described earlier in this chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Move Actions</h2>\n<p>It takes a move action to board, drive, start, abruptly stop, or take control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Board or Disembark from a Vehicle</h3>\n<p>You can board or disembark from a vehicle as a move action. Doing so while the vehicle is in motion requires a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check; see Boarding on page 285.</p>\n<h3>Drive</h3>\n<p>You can pilot a vehicle at its drive speed, which is noted in the Speed entry of the vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) as a move action. You can turn as needed throughout that movement, and you set your heading at the end of the drive action.<br /><br />Vehicles provoke attacks of opportunity while driving, and when you are in a vehicle that&rsquo;s driving, you similarly provoke attacks of opportunity if you take any actions that would normally do so (including making ranged attacks) unless the vehicle provides total cover. You can&rsquo;t use the drive action to move a vehicle through spaces occupied by creatures, even if they&rsquo;re allies.</p>\n<h3>Start Vehicle</h3>\n<p>Firing the ignition of a vehicle is typically a move action, though more complicated vehicles might have a multistage startup sequence requiring multiple actions.</p>\n<h3>Stop Short</h3>\n<p>Stopping a vehicle after a race action (see Race below) requires a move action (stopping after a drive action doesn&rsquo;t require an action; see Not an Action on page 280). Normally, a vehicle continues to move following a race action. You can attempt a Piloting check (see Pilot a Vehicle on page 146) to reduce the distance your vehicle moves before stopping after a race action by the result of your check, rounded down to the next 5-foot increment. For example, with a result of 17 you would reduce the distance moved by 15 feet (3 squares).</p>\n<h3>Take Control</h3>\n<p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action. See Uncontrolled Vehicles on page 280 for more information about taking control of an uncontrolled vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Full Actions</h2>\n<p>Speed along in a straight line or attacking with the body of a vehicle takes a full action, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Race</h3>\n<p>When making a race action, you pilot a vehicle at full speed in a straight line at its current heading using a full action. You must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + your vehicle&rsquo;s item level) to race. If your vehicle is starting from a dead stop (that is, it didn&rsquo;t move last round), the DC of the check increases by 5.<br /><br />If you fail this Piloting check, the vehicle&rsquo;s behavior depends on the circumstances of the check and the surrounding terrain. If you were attempting to race from a dead stop, the vehicle stalls and doesn&rsquo;t move at all. If the vehicle was already moving, its behavior depends on the terrain. Rough terrain slows the vehicle, causing it to move at half its full speed at its current heading. On flat terrain, the vehicle usually moves at full speed but goes significantly off course. In this case, the GM should take the 180-degree arc in front of the vehicle and divide it into four equal 45-degree arcs. Then the GM randomly determines which of these arcs the vehicle moves into.<br /><br />A vehicle can&rsquo;t safely race through difficult terrain or over obstacles unless outfitted with special gear, nor can it safely race to a destination you can&rsquo;t see unless you&rsquo;ve thoroughly scanned the destination. If you force a vehicle to race unsafely, you must attempt a Piloting check at a DC determined by the GM (usually 20 + the vehicle&rsquo;s item level) when you encounter the difficult terrain or obstacle. If you fail or the vehicle is uncontrolled (see page 280), the vehicle crashes or spins out, as determined by the GM.<br /><br />After taking a race action, a vehicle doesn&rsquo;t slow down immediately. On your next turn, you have four options: you can use another full action to continue to race at full speed, use a move action to drive at the vehicle&rsquo;s drive speed, use a move action to stop short, or relinquish control of the vehicle as a swift action. If you take a swift or move action, you can also take a standard action during that turn. For instance, you could race one turn, then on your next turn, you could fire a weapon as a standard action and then drive as your move action.<br /><br />A racing vehicle provokes attacks of opportunity, but it gets a +2 bonus to its AC against them due to its speed.<br /><br />Many vehicles have extremely high full speeds compared to creatures&rsquo; speeds, so racing at full speed is often tantamount to exiting a battle entirely, unless other vehicles get involved.</p>\n<h3>Ram</h3>\n<p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to its full speed in a straight line at its current heading and try to ram one creature or object at the end of the movement, dealing double the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to the target and half the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to your vehicle. A vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see page 228).<br /><br />Movement during a ram action has all the same restrictions as the race action and requires the same Piloting checks. If you fail any Piloting check during the movement, you fail to ram your target.<br /><br />If the target of the ram action is a creature, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the vehicle&rsquo;s collision DC to avoid being hit. If the target of the ram action is another vehicle, the pilot of the defending vehicle can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit, with a DC equal to the result of your Piloting check. The attacker wins ties.</p>\n<h3>Run Over</h3>\n<p>As a full action, you can pilot a vehicle at up to double its drive speed and run over any creatures at least two size categories smaller than the vehicle during this movement. Those creatures take bludgeoning damage equal to the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage, but can each attempt a Reflex save against the vehicle&rsquo;s collision DC to take half damage. Roll the damage only once and apply it to each creature, rather than rolling separately for each. A vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage and collision DC are listed in the Attack (Collision) entry of its statistics (see Vehicles on page 228).<br /><br />When you take a run over action, the vehicle takes damage equal to half the damage rolled for each creature it runs over. If the vehicle becomes unable to proceed due to this damage, it ceases moving. You can still set the vehicle&rsquo;s heading at the end of this movement as normal.<br /><br />A vehicle taking the run over action can damage a creature no more than once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. The vehicle can run over objects of the appropriate size with the same effects, though they don&rsquo;t receive saving throws unless they are piloted or otherwise animate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Swift Actions</h2>\n<p>It takes a swift action to engage or disengage a vehicle&rsquo;s autocontrol or autopilot or to relinquish control of a vehicle, as detailed below.</p>\n<h3>Engage or Disengage Autocontrol</h3>\n<p>You can engage a vehicle&rsquo;s autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action. You can disengage its autocontrol as a swift action anytime. See Autocontrol below for more.</p>\n<h3>Engage or Disengage Autopilot</h3>\n<p>You can engage a vehicle&rsquo;s autopilot as a swift action (see Autopilot below).</p>\n<h3>Relinquish Control</h3>\n<p>You can voluntarily hand over control of a vehicle to another pilot as a swift action. If you relinquish control of a vehicle but another pilot does not take over control, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled (see Uncontrolled Vehicles below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Not an Action</h2>\n<p>The following does not require an action.</p>\n<h3>Stop</h3>\n<p>You can stop a vehicle after a drive action without difficulty and without spending an action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Uncontrolled Vehicles</h1>\n<p>If you are knocked out or cease actively piloting, your vehicle becomes uncontrolled. If you delay your action, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled and continues to act on the same initiative count as it did before. This separates your initiative count from that of the vehicle, and the vehicle continues to move (see below) at your previous initiative count until a pilot takes control of it or it crashes or otherwise is brought to a definitive halt.<br /><br />Unless otherwise specified, an uncontrolled vehicle moves straight ahead at its most recent heading as if taking two drive actions on its turn. It slows down incrementally with each action taken (usually to three-quarters the speed of its last action) until it comes to a stop or crashes. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, it could slow down more if it&rsquo;s on uneven terrain or an upward slope, or it could stay at the same speed or even accelerate if it&rsquo;s in a zero-g environment or on a downward slope.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Taking Control</h2>\n<p>You can take control of an uncontrolled vehicle as a move action (see Take Control on page 278). During this move action, the vehicle doesn&rsquo;t move any additional distance&mdash;you spend the whole action taking control. Once the action is taken, the vehicle resets to your initiative count, and you can spend any remaining actions piloting the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crashing</h2>\n<p>If an uncontrolled vehicle runs into an obstacle or another vehicle, it crashes. This deals double the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to the uncontrolled vehicle and to the obstacle it ran into, and stops the uncontrolled vehicle&rsquo;s progress. If the uncontrolled vehicle crashes into a controlled vehicle, the other pilot can attempt a Piloting check to avoid being hit as if it were being rammed (see Ram on page 279). If that pilot avoids being hit, the uncontrolled vehicle continues to move as detailed in Uncontrolled Vehicles above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Autocontrol</h1>\n<p>Some vehicles have autocontrol, which enables you to spend your actions on tasks other than piloting, but is far less capable than an autopilot. You can engage autocontrol as a swift action after taking a drive or race action, and it lasts until it is disengaged (also a swift action) or until the vehicle is no longer capable of moving. When you&rsquo;re using autocontrol, the vehicle becomes uncontrolled, but each round it moves in a straight line for the same distance and at the same heading and speed as the last pilot action (moving as if taking two drive actions if drive was the last action the pilot took, or as a race action if that was the last action the pilot took). The autocontrol uses the result of the pilot&rsquo;s most recent Piloting check as the result of its Piloting checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Autopilot</h1>\n<p>Some vehicles have an autopilot AI that can control the vehicle in place of an actual pilot. You can engage or disengage an autopilot as a swift action. You can input a destination into an autopilot as a move action, and the autopilot attempts to reach that location if doing so is possible (provided the autopilot isn&rsquo;t locked by a passcode or otherwise programmed not to obey).<br /><br />A vehicle is considered controlled when the autopilot is engaged. An autopilot&rsquo;s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br /><br />The Systems entry in a vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) lists the autopilot&rsquo;s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle&rsquo;s modifier (listed in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Attacking from a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>Anyone attacking while on a vehicle takes that vehicle&rsquo;s penalty to attack rolls, as listed in the Modifiers entry of the vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228). It&rsquo;s especially difficult to attack from a vehicle that&rsquo;s moving at high speed, so a vehicle might have a higher modifier on attacks (shown in parentheses) when traveling at full speed. The penalty for moving at full speed applies if the vehicle moved at full speed during the last round. The attack penalty doesn&rsquo;t apply when the vehicle is stopped.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Firing Vehicle Weapons</h2>\n<p>Firing a weapon mounted on a vehicle works like firing a normal ranged weapon, but you must activate the vehicle&rsquo;s weapons instead of ones you hold. The penalties to attack rolls in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry also apply to attacks made with a vehicle&rsquo;s weapons.<br /><br />Some vehicles have weapons bound to their steering devices or weapons that are operated from the same control panel. These can be fired when you are piloting, though you normally can&rsquo;t fire the vehicle&rsquo;s weapons on the same turn that you race (or on the same turn that you take another full action) because you don&rsquo;t have enough available actions. Weapons mounted in other manners typically need to be fired by creatures on the vehicle that are dedicated gunners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Drive-By Attacks</h2>\n<p>Because many vehicles have full speeds that might let them move across an entire battle map, the GM may need to make a judgment call when vehicles leave the map and want to return. The GM determines how long returning takes, but it normally takes at least 1 round to double back, since it takes a move action to drive and change heading.<br /><br />In theory, creatures could pile on a vehicle, ready actions to shoot enemies as soon as they&rsquo;re within 30 feet, race the vehicle across the map, and fire in passing. Such a maneuver might seem like a sure thing, but it comes with a few problems. First, the attackers take a big penalty to all their attacks, but enemies who ready actions to fire back don&rsquo;t take those penalties. Second, enemies have time to prepare while the vehicle is off the map. They might take cover, set up obstacles to prevent the vehicle from racing through, or just leave. The GM might also rule that the attackers can&rsquo;t keep a good watch on what&rsquo;s happening while they&rsquo;re off the map or that the vehicle breaks down after the stress of using such a tactic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Escaping on a Vehicle</h1>\n<p>Because vehicles have a top speed that&rsquo;s far faster than most creatures can run, creatures in a vehicle can usually escape from a battle with enemies who are on foot, if they want. The GM has final say on whether a vehicle can escape. Usually, once a vehicle is beyond the range that the enemies on foot can run, those enemies get one more volley of attacks, and then the vehicle and everyone on it escapes. However, if the enemies also board a vehicle, they can usually pursue and the battle transitions to a vehicle chase (see page 282).</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

On paper, the career seems simple: get a ship, get a crew, get cargo, get paid. In reality, nothing ever seems to go as planned&mdash;starships break down or get scorched in firefights, a journey through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} turns out far more dangerous than expected, and sellers overcharge while buyers haggle down. But the prospect of danger and uncertainty makes for an exciting Starfinder campaign! The following optional rules provide a new way to structure a campaign around a PC crew of independent merchants flying a starship of their own while buying, moving, and selling cargo in the Pact Worlds, Near Space, and the Vast.<br /><br />During the Fly Free or Die Adventure Path, the PCs take control of their professional destinies to work as freelance traders and troubleshooters. The rules presented in this article are designed to simulate part of that lifestyle, and you can use them in almost any campaign, especially a sandbox-style one.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Alternative Build Points</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">These new rules focus on altering the way PCs can obtain Build Points (BP) for building and upgrading starships. In the normal rules, Build Points are a pool that constantly increases as the PCs level up, but in this subsystem, Build Points become a form of currency. The PCs spend BP to buy a starship and cargo, and they earn BP whenever they make a sale.<br /><br />The PCs&rsquo; starship becomes an investment like any other piece of equipment, but bought with BP instead of credits. As the PCs complete jobs, they get more Build Points to spend on upgrading their starship. They can do so gradually, installing one new system at a time, or they can hoard BP and then spend them all at once. However, the PCs should always keep some BP on hand to buy the cargo for their next job. If the PCs&rsquo; ship is destroyed, they also lose the BP they invested in it! (Many crews insure their starships for just this eventuality; see page 54 for details.) But if the PCs&rsquo; business flourishes, they&rsquo;ll find themselves living in the lap of luxury, hiring additional employees, or even buying a second starship to ply the interstellar trade routes.<br /><br />The Starfinder Core Rulebook includes some guidelines for how PCs can acquire the BP they need to build and upgrade their first starship&mdash;via salvage, favors, or an arrangement with a friendly spacedock, for instance. In this case, Build Points represent much more than simple credits and become exclusively useful through the starship creation system, staying separate from the methods by which PCs buy their personal equipment. This separation provides an important distinction because if PCs had the ability to exchange Build Points for credits, they could end up underpowered in starship combat while simultaneously overpowered in all their other encounters.<br /><br />In the rules presented here, Build Points roughly represent the party&rsquo;s business capital. That capital has many components, including the PCs&rsquo; available credit, loans they&rsquo;ve taken out, and assets they might use as collateral. PCs use this capital to make big purchases, like cargo or starship modifications, often with financing help from a bank or other establishment.<br /><br />To begin, the PCs receive a number of Build Points determined by their Average Party Level (APL) as noted in Table 9&ndash;1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. They should use this BP to build their starship; you might want to remind the PCs that their vessel needs plenty of room for cargo and that they&rsquo;ll have to spend a few BP to purchase that cargo. (The PCs in &ldquo;We&rsquo;re No Heroes&rdquo; receive a prebuilt starship and earn a few extra BP by the end of the adventure.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Galactic Trade Basics</h1>\n<p>The PCs will earn most of their Build Points by hauling cargo from one world to another. See Running the System on page 55 for other ways the PCs can receive BP.<br /><br />A cargo job boils down into several steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find Cargo: The PCs find cargo. Determine the cargo&rsquo;s type, the price to buy it, its destination (if any), and how much it might sell for.</li>\n<li>Determine Complication: Most jobs have a unique complicating factor, which you determine in secret when the PCs find their cargo.</li>\n<li>Transport: The PCs take the cargo to its destination or to a world where they hope to sell it.</li>\n<li>Make the Sale: The PCs deliver the cargo to its intended recipient or try to find a buyer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Find Cargo</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Cargo in the Starfinder setting is standardized into lots, each massing 25 tons. A single lot of cargo fits into one of a starship&rsquo;s cargo holds, so the PCs can transport a number of lots equal to the number of cargo holds on their vessel. Finding cargo to buy is a downtime activity as detailed in the sidebar on page 52. For more on downtime activities, see page 150 of the Starfinder Character Operations Manual.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cargo Type</h3>\n<p>When the PCs successfully find cargo to purchase, you determine the type of cargo, usually to match the needs of your campaign. Alternatively, you can randomly determine the type of cargo by rolling a d20 on the table below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 1d20]]</td>\n<td>CARGO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Art or antiques</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Base metals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Ceramics or glassware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Chemicals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Furniture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Hides or leather</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Live animals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Machinery or electronics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Minerals or byproducts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Paper products or books</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Plastics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Precision equipment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Precious metals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Prepared food</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Textiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Toys or games</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Vegetable products</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Vehicles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Weapons or ammo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Wood</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Find Cargo</h3>\n<p>You look for suitable cargo to purchase with the hopes of selling it elsewhere.<br /><br />Activity: You spend the day searching the infosphere, talking with contacts, and visiting warehouses or the local starport. You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find cargo in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your character level). You take a cumulative &ndash;1 penalty to this roll for every find cargo activity you or your allies have previously attempted in this settlement within the last week.<br /><br />Results: On a success, you find 1d4 lots of cargo that you can buy. The cargo can&rsquo;t be split up; all of the lots must be bought together. The cargo&rsquo;s total buy price equals 1d4 BP &times; the number of lots. For every 5 by which the result of your check exceeds the DC, you can increase or decrease the amount of cargo by 1 lot.<br /><br />The GM determines the type of cargo and might even tell you where you can sell it for a reasonable price. All of the cargo must be transported and sold together; you and your allies must load the cargo onto your starship yourselves. You might have to deliver some cargoes within a certain time frame. When you&rsquo;re told the type of cargo, its buy price, and (if applicable) its destination and its sell price, you can choose not to purchase that cargo. However, when you purchase the cargo, you decide what to do with it, though you might want to perform the find buyer downtime activity (see below) at another settlement to sell it.<br /><br />Special: If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shipping or Speculation?</h3>\n<p>When the PCs purchase cargo, they generally have to find a place to sell it themselves. After all, transport drivers who earn flat rates usually cover established shipping routes; as galactic traders, the PCs typically do more than that. However, at your discretion, the seller can give the PCs a tip as to where they might offload the cargo they just bought. This tactic can benefit players who&rsquo;ve just started interacting with this system or for groups who only want to dip their toes into the trading game. In such cases, the PCs don&rsquo;t need to use the find buyer downtime activity (see above), and they receive an amount of BP of your choosing per cargo lot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Destination</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that the cargo&rsquo;s seller gives the PCs an idea of where to sell those goods, you can choose that destination based on the needs of your campaign (especially if the players have expressed interest in going to a specific place). Alternatively, you can randomly determine the general destination by rolling a d10 on the table below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r D10]]</td>\n<td>DESTINATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}. If the PCs are already on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, reroll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2&ndash;4</td>\n<td>A different world in the same star system where the PCs bought the cargo.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5&ndash;7</td>\n<td>A world in Near Space.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8&ndash;10</td>\n<td>A world in the Vast.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Determine Complication</h2>\n<p>Once a PC finds the cargo, but before they commit to purchasing it, you should determine what makes this particular job unusual. You decide the complication, and the PCs decide how to deal with it&mdash;if they even become aware of the problem, that is!<br /><br />To randomly determine a complication, roll a d10 on the table below, keeping the result a secret. You can tweak the result as needed for your campaign; once you&rsquo;ve rolled the same result from the table a couple of times, consider throwing out that entry and substituting one of your own! If a complication requires a skill check, the DC for that check equals 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the party&rsquo;s APL. Usually, only one PC should attempt this check. An asterisk (*) marks a complication that the PCs can be made aware of before purchasing the cargo, and some complications modify the buy or sell price of the cargo.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r D10]]</td>\n<td>COMPLICATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Competition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Expiration Date*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Handling Problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>High Demand*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Imitation*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Regulated*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Stolen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Stowaway</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Strange Customs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Tough Sell</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Competition: Once the PCs have loaded their cargo and determined their destination, a rival crew contacts them and declares they&rsquo;re selling similar cargo at that location. Determine how long the rival crew takes to reach the destination (usually assuming average time in the Drift); if the PCs don&rsquo;t beat the rival crew to the destination, the sell price is reduced by 2 BP per lot.<br /><br />Expiration Date*: This cargo is perishable. If the PCs don&rsquo;t deliver it in 2d8 days, they can sell it for a maximum of 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Handling Problems: There&rsquo;s a potential accident while loading or unloading the cargo. Treat this complication as a trap with a CR equal to the party&rsquo;s APL. The exact nature of the trap and the skills necessary to disable it are up to you.<br /><br />High Demand*: This cargo is trending. The buy price is increased by 1 BP per lot, and the sell price is increased by 2 BP per lot.<br /><br />Imitation*: These goods are actually cheap knockoffs. A PC can detect this fact with a successful Perception check, reducing the buy and sell prices by 2 BP per lot. If the PCs want to try to sell the goods at the unreduced price, they must succeed at a Bluff check or else attract the attention of law enforcement.<br /><br />Regulated*: Exhaustive laws govern this cargo at the point of purchase. A PC must succeed at a Computers or Profession (merchant) check, or the crew members must spend 1 day navigating customs and filling out forms before they can load the cargo on their ship.<br /><br />Stolen: This cargo was stolen from another crew, and they&rsquo;re coming to get it back! This complication represents a hard encounter, but the PCs can pacify the NPCs by surrendering the cargo.<br /><br />Stowaway: An NPC with a CR equal to the party&rsquo;s APL hides among the cargo, revealing themself after takeoff. A PC who succeeds at a Perception check can detect the stowaway during the cargo-loading process.<br /><br />Strange Customs: The buyer comes from an unfamiliar culture or has unusual traditions. A PC must attempt a Culture check to maintain proper etiquette. If they succeed, the sell price increases by 1 BP per lot. If they fail, the sell price decreases by 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Tough Sell: The buyer tries to strong-arm the PCs, reducing the sell price by 2 BP per lot. A PC can negate this reduction with a successful Intimidate check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Transport</h2>\n<p>Next, the PCs must get the cargo onto their starship and transport it to a place where they can sell it. In general, the farther the PCs take the cargo, the more it&rsquo;s worth (see Table below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cargo Handling</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loading or unloading a single lot into a starship cargo hold takes 1 hour for one person using a cargo lifter (Core Rulebook 204) or similar equipment. Without such equipment, loading the same lot takes 8 hours of labor; multiple people can work together to reduce this time. For example, it takes 4 hours for two people without major equipment to load a single lot into a cargo hold. While the PCs can usually take their time, a complication might mean that every hour counts!<br /><br />The PCs must also unload the cargo once they reach the world where they want to sell it, but unloading generally occurs while at least one of the crew engages in the find buyer downtime activity (page 54).</p>\n<h2>Make the Sale</h2>\n<p>Once the PCs have reached the area where they want to try to sell their cargo, finding a buyer is a downtime activity detailed below. Certain complications might make this activity more difficult, but once a PC finds a buyer, you need to determine the sale price.</p>\n<h3>Cargo Sell Price</h3>\n<p>First, determine the base sell price of a cargo by rolling a d8; if you roll an 8, roll again once, and add the new result to 8. This result is modified by the distance traveled (as noted on the table below) and any complications, in that order; the total results in a sale price per lot (minimum 1 BP per lot). Finally, the results of the PCs&rsquo; find buyer downtime activity can also alter this price.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TRAVEL TIME</td>\n<td>DESTINATION</td>\n<td>BASE SELL PRICE MODIFIER</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 1d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>Another world in the system or @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}</td>\n<td>&ndash;2 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 2d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>One of the Pact Worlds other than @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} from outside the system</td>\n<td>&ndash;1 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 3d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>A Near Space world</td>\n<td>No change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[[/r 5d6 #days]] days</td>\n<td>A Vast world</td>\n<td>+1 BP/lot</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Find Buyer</h3>\n<p>You look for someone interested in buying your cargo.<br /><br />Activity: You spend a day researching markets on the infosphere, checking with union or guild representatives, meeting with local contacts, and haggling. You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find a buyer in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; your level).<br /><br />Results: On a success, you find someone willing to buy your cargo for the sell price (as determined by the GM). For every 5 by which your check exceeds the DC, increase the sell price of the cargo by 1 BP per lot. If you fail, you still find a buyer, but the sell price of the cargo is reduced by 1 BP per lot.<br /><br />Special: If multiple allies perform this downtime activity on the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Spending Build Points</h1>\n<p>The following section expands on the rules for spending Build Points and includes some obligatory expenditures (like upgrading the PCs&rsquo; starship so they can take on more lucrative jobs and bigger threats) as well as new options (like having a comfortable lifestyle or hiring employees). The PCs can hold onto as many unspent BP as they like.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expansion</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP to hire agents, professional representatives, and even full-time employees who work for them. They can also buy another starship and hire crew to haul cargo as part of their overall operations. When the PCs hire personnel to expand their business, you decide the NPCs&rsquo; stats (though usually, an NPC has a total skill bonus in a handful of skills equal to 4 + 1-1/2 &times; their CR). Though usually loyal to the PCs, these NPCs won&rsquo;t risk their lives. If treated poorly, they might leave the PCs&rsquo; service. An employee hired by the PCs agrees to a 1-year contract; at the end of that term, the PCs must hire them again, or the NPC leaves their service.<br /><br />Planetary Agent: A planetary agent costs BP equal to the agent&rsquo;s CR, which can be no higher than the party&rsquo;s APL; as the party&rsquo;s APL increases, the PCs can spend the difference to raise the agent&rsquo;s CR. The agent lives on one world or space station; while they may have many other clients, they work on the PCs&rsquo; behalf to perform the find cargo and find buyer downtime activities. The agent can also perform the gather information task of the Diplomacy skill. The agent won&rsquo;t leave the world on which they&rsquo;re stationed. The PCs must supply the agent with the credits or other requirements necessary for any task they ask the NPC to perform.<br /><br />System-Wide Representative: A system-wide representative operates similarly to a planetary agent, but the system-wide representative will travel to any world in a single star system (such as the Pact Worlds system). A system-wide representative costs BP equal to twice the representative&rsquo;s CR, which can be no higher than the party&rsquo;s APL.<br /><br />Starship: The PCs can use their BP to buy another starship. This starship can&rsquo;t be higher in tier than the party&rsquo;s APL &ndash; 2. The PCs must spend additional BP equal to 5 &times; the starship&rsquo;s tier to hire an NPC crew to run this starship; each crew member has a CR equal to the starship&rsquo;s tier, and they follow the PCs&rsquo; instructions when it comes to buying, transporting, and selling cargo as well as the starship&rsquo;s day-to-day operations. All the BP earned by this other ship goes to the party&rsquo;s pool of BP. The PCs are responsible for the costs and maintenance of any additional starships they own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\n<p>The PCs can insure their starship or cargo. Starship insurance policies cost a number of BP equal to a percentage of their starship&rsquo;s total BP value at time of purchase (see below). An insurance policy remains in effect for 1 year; after this time, the PCs must buy a new policy (at a higher price if their starship has increased in BP value). If the PCs&rsquo; starship is completely destroyed with a policy in effect, the PCs receive a percentage of the ship&rsquo;s BP value in payment. The rest of the Build Points the PCs spent on their starship are lost!<br /><br />Starship insurance policies are rated bronze, silver, and gold. A bronze insurance policy costs 5% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 50% of the total value. A silver insurance policy costs 10% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 75% of the total value. A gold insurance policy costs 15% of the starship&rsquo;s total BP value and pays out 100% of the total value.<br /><br />To insure cargo, the PCs can buy a policy for 10% of the cargo&rsquo;s buy price (minimum 1 BP). If the cargo is lost and not delivered, and the PCs can prove that they didn&rsquo;t steal or lose the cargo through negligence, they&rsquo;re repaid BP equal to the cargo&rsquo;s buy price.<br /><br />The PCs can have only one insurance policy per starship and per each cargo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP to live the good life. These lifestyles assume a group of 4 PCs; you can adjust the costs for larger and smaller groups as you see fit. Lifestyles don&rsquo;t impart any mechanical benefits to the characters.<br /><br />Comfortable: The party spends 1 BP to live comfortably for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in spacious lodgings decorated to their taste and have access to stylish personal transportation. They partake in high-quality food and drink whenever they wish, and they attire themselves in fashionable and flattering clothing.<br /><br />Luxurious: The party spends 5 BP to live in luxury for 1 month on a single world or space station. The PCs reside in fabulous homes in an elite neighborhood; they have multiple forms of personal transportation, and unique fashions made for them by famous designers (equivalent to formal wear) fill their wardrobes. A large staff of professionals&mdash;housekeepers, gardeners, personal tailors and groomers, a chauffeur&mdash;see to everyday chores the PCs don&rsquo;t wish to concern themselves with (each professional is a professional freelancer with a skill bonus equal to the party&rsquo;s APL).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Upgrades</h2>\n<p>The PCs can spend BP on their starship if they have the time and facilities required make such upgrades (Starfinder Core Rulebook 305). Using this system, the total BP value of the PCs&rsquo; starship can be no more than 5% more than the value listed for its tier in Table 9-1: Starship Base Statistics on page 294 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook. For example: a group of 1st-level PCs have a tier 1 starship on which they have spent a total of 52 Build Points (saving the rest to purchase cargo). As they accumulate BP by selling cargo, they can spend, at most, 5 BP to upgrade their starship, raising its BP value to 57 (5% more than the 55 BP used to normally create a tier 1 starship). When their APL rises to 2, this group can upgrade their starship further but no higher than 78 BP (because a tier 2 starship is normally created with 75 BP). The PCs still can&rsquo;t spend more than 1,000 BP on their starship when their APL reaches 20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Downgrades</h2>\n<p>Due to bad luck or mishandling of cargo, the PCs might end up with no spare BP to keep the cycle of buying and selling going. In such cases, the PCs can sell parts of their starship to acquire BP. There&rsquo;s no added cost to downgrade; for instance, if the PCs want to pawn their vessel&rsquo;s coilgun, they receive the weapon&rsquo;s full BP cost of 6.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Running The System</h1>\n<p>In many ways, this subsystem helps generate short adventures for your cargo-hauling PCs since there&rsquo;s always a chance of something going a little wrong. At the very least, the system works hand-in-hand with a sandbox-style campaign, as the PCs travel from world to world looking to buy low and sell high!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Session Zero</h2>\n<p>Before beginning a game using the galactic trade subsystem, make sure your players are interested in engaging in the life of freelance merchants. While it might not seem as glamorous as delving into alien ruins or fighting back against an evil empire (though galactic traders can still undertake such adventures), this type of campaign has its appeal to certain players. Generally, merchant PCs aren&rsquo;t beholden to any one patron and can go where they please. However, if your group doesn&rsquo;t seem keen on the bookkeeping required, it might be better not to use this subsystem!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GMing Expectations</h2>\n<p>On average, the PCs will need to complete three to four cargo transport jobs to gain enough BP to upgrade their starship to the next tier. As the group advances in level, they might need to complete a few extra transport jobs per tier, depending on their market savvy and whether or not they&rsquo;ve switched to a larger frame that can hold more cargo.<br /><br />Of course, during this time, the PCs should earn XP in the usual ways (by overcoming skill-based challenges, defeating enemies, and earning story-based rewards) so that the group&rsquo;s APL keeps approximate pace with the amount of BP they can invest in their starship. At your discretion, you can reward the PCs with XP as if they had overcome an easy encounter (Starfinder Core Rulebook 390) upon selling their cargo; you should add this XP to any XP they earn from encounters that emerge from complications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Sources of Build Points</h2>\n<p>This subsystem assumes that the PCs earn their BP only from transporting and selling cargo. However, at your discretion, you can reward them with BP as treasure from particular encounters (such as a raid on a smuggling operation&rsquo;s warehouses) or as salvage from starship combat encounters (such as a fight against a rogue Corpse Fleet ship). In the former case, the PCs have to transport the BP to their ship much in the same way as loading cargo (count a cargo lot as 4 BP for these purposes), and in the latter case, the PCs can earn a number of BP depending on the enemy starship&rsquo;s size category (Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, etc.).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Free Traders</h1>\n<p>The free trader archetype is an excellent choice for a character in a campaign focused on galactic trade. The merchant savvy ability can be used with these rules as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A free trader can use market savvy to reroll the checks required for the find cargo and find buyer downtime activities.</li>\n<li>At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, a free trader can use market savvy to reroll skill checks during a complication.</li>\n<li>At 9th level, a free trader can transport an extra lot of cargo for every five cargo holds their starship has; at 14th level, this bonus increases to an extra lot of cargo for every two cargo holds their starship has.</li>\n<li>At 18th level, a free trader can spend Resolve Points to negotiate the best possible price, reducing the cargo&rsquo;s buy price by 1 BP per lot or raising the sell price of cargo by 1 BP per lot during the find cargo or find buyer downtime activities, respectively; the free trader must be the primary PC performing the activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"></span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

Specific accessories are sometimes exceptions to these rules. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Capacity And Usage</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Some accessories require power to function, similar to some technological items; see page 218 of the Core Rulebook for more information. These accessories are identified with capacity and usage entries in Table 1&ndash;11: Weapon Accessories. A weapon accessory&rsquo;s capacity is the highest-capacity battery that the accessory can use. Usage lists the rate at which charges are consumed when the accessory is used. Attached accessories (see Adding Accessories below) must use their own batteries, but an accessory integrated into a powered weapon can be configured to use either the weapon&rsquo;s battery or its own battery. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Type</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Some accessories can be added only to specific types or categories of weapons, as noted in the Weapon Type entry in Table 1&ndash;11: Weapon Accessories. For the most part, these correspond to the weapon types and categories described on pages 169&ndash;170 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Railed Weapons</strong>: Railed weapons are longarms, heavy weapons, and sniper weapons, all of which have rails along or near the weapon&rsquo;s barrel that allow you to easily add accessories to the weapon. A railed weapon has four rails to which accessories can be added: one on top, one on the bottom, and one on either side. Only one weapon accessory can be added to each rail. Some accessories must be attached to a specific rail, such as the top or bottom, as detailed in the accessory&rsquo;s description. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Adding Accessories</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_SectionHeader\">Weapon accessories must normally be added to a weapon to function. Most accessories can be added either by being attached to a weapon or by being integrated into the weapon, though some accessories must be added in a certain way, as indicated in the accessory&rsquo;s description. In either case, add the bulk of the weapon accessory to the weapon&rsquo;s bulk to determine the final accessorized weapon&rsquo;s bulk. When adding multiple items of light bulk together, treat 2&ndash;10 light bulk items as 1 bulk when combined.<br /><br /><strong>Attachment</strong>: An attached weapon accessory is affixed to a weapon but is not really part of it. Anyone can attach or detach an accessory as a full action, and most weapons dealers will attach an accessory bought from them at no extra charge.<br /><br /><strong>Integration</strong>: An integrated weapon accessory is built into the weapon, becoming part of it. Integrated accessories are usually purchased already integrated into the weapon at the combined price of the weapon and the accessory. If the weapon and accessory are purchased separately, a weapons dealer can integrate the accessory into the weapon for a fee of 10% of the accessory&rsquo;s purchase price. You can integrate an accessory into a weapon (or remove an integrated accessory) if you have a number of ranks in Engineering (or both Engineering and Mysticism, for hybrid accessories) equal to the item level of the weapon or accessory, whichever is higher. It takes 1 hour to integrate an accessory or remove an integrated accessory from a weapon.</span></p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"o5FtLBDT0f0zig3C","name":"Sense Through","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Sense through is the special ability to perceive things beyond an obstacle or barrier that would otherwise block normal senses. It allows a creature to attempt Perception checks into areas that would otherwise lie beyond its senses. Sense through augments a creature’s precise or imprecise senses, rather than replacing them. For example, a creature cannot have a form of sense through based on vision unless it has standard vision. Sense through may be a supernatural power to sense things beyond normal perception or an extraordinary ability representing enhanced senses, and it can be granted by equipment (such as laser microphones and X-ray visors), natural abilities (such as some dragons’ ability to see through smoke), and other effects. Sense through operates out to a range specified in the creature’s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with sense through typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision) allows a creature to see through obstacles that would normally block vision. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable—for example, if a creature whose vision is augmented by sense through is blinded—the creature loses access to its sense through ability. The typical senses through which creatures with sense through can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, hearing, vibration, and vision.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with sense through (vision) is considered to have darkvision to a range of 60 feet unless stated otherwise. This enables the creature to perceive through materials such as armor, briefcases, and other concealing items, meaning the creature can use Perception to search more quickly and easily (searching up to a 20-foot-by-20-foot area in a single round), though such quick searches reveal only things accessible by that sense. If a secret door is concealed behind a material that blocks this ability (see below), a quick search using sense through (vision) would not reveal it.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Some sense through abilities allow a creature to sense through only specific materials. Such materials are indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, sense through (vision [smoke only]) allows a creature to see through smoke as if it were not present, but all other obstacles to vision work normally. A sense through ability that works against only a specific material otherwise works like the sense it is associated with, including requiring Perception checks to notice things.</span></p>\n<h3>Blocking Sense Through</h3>\n<p> Some sense through abilities (generally those of a magical nature) cannot penetrate specific materials. This is indicated in brackets after the associated sense in the sense through entry in the creature’s statistics. For example, a lycanthrope with sense through (scent [blocked by silver]) can smell through walls—but not through even a thin layer of silver.</p>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, in addition to all other limitations, sense through is blocked by energy fields and sufficiently dense material. This includes all energy fields that impact the physical world (such as force fields that grant temporary Hit Points and force effects such as the wall of force spell). The density limitation generally causes these senses to be blocked by 10 feet of wood or plastic, 5 feet of stone, 1 foot of common metal, or 6 inches of lead or any starmetal (such as adamantine). Typical suits of armor and containers do not block such vision unless they specify otherwise.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"oh4kWUY8g381pYxn","name":"Critical Hit Tables","content":"<h2>CRITICAL HITS</h2>\n<h3>PLAYER USE</h3>\n<p>Whenever a PC scores a critical hit, that characters player draws one card from the deck and applies the effect appropriate to that attack's type (energy, kinetic, or spell), or may choose the \"extreme blow' effect if it matches the attack's damage type (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, sonic) or attack type (melee, ranged, or spell).</p>\n<h3>GM USE</h3>\n<p>The GM can use one of three different methods to determine when they draw cards to modify critical hits. Since the effects on each card can be deadly against player characters, we recommend using the first option.</p>\n<p>• Option 1: The GM draws a card only when a major villain, creature, or NPC scores a critical hit<br />• Option 2: Using this deck becomes an option that can be given to NPCs as a special ability, and the GM only draws cards for NPCs with that ability.<br />• Option 3: The GM draws a card when any creature or NPC scores a critical hit. </p>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL RULES </h3>\n<p>• A critical hit deals double damage to the target unless the entry says it deals normal damage or triple damage,<br />• Any effect listed as a Crit Effect is considered a critical hit effect. If your attack already has a critical hit effect, you may apply its normal critical hit effect or the card effect, but not both.<br />• If an effect is listed as a Bonus Effect, apply it in addition to the attack's other critical hit effects.<br />• Effects that scale by level use a weapon's item level, a spell's caster level, Or the character's level for supernatural effects as the critical hit effect's level. Round fractions up. If the effect is based on a spell, this critical hit effect level is also used as the caster level for any calculations not defined on the card.<br />• The save DC for an effect inflicted by a PC is 1/2 character level + key ability score. For NPCs the save DC is determined by the NPC's ability DC for its array and level.<br />• An effect that uses the name of an existing critical hit effect (Starfinder Core Rulebook 182) follows the rules for that critical hit effect. <br />• An effect that lasts until healed ends once the recipient regains Hit Points equal to the damage dealt by the attack. </p>\n<p> </p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"p9aQ2VGOiE6f9mQT","name":"Invisible","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An invisible creature is visually undetectable. A creature using only an imprecise sense, or whose only precise sense is vision, can’t observe an invisible creature, so the invisible creature is unseen by such a would-be observer. Creatures with blindsight can perceive invisible creatures normally, since blindsight is a precise sense that does not rely on vision, and thus can observe invisible creatures. See Senses on page 260 and Dealing with Unseen Creatures on page 261 for more information.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Invisible creatures remain invisible even in unusual environments, such as underwater, and when subject to effects such as fog or smoke. They are not magically silenced. They can still be heard, smelled, and felt as normal, even if other creatures can’t see them. Invisible creatures leave tracks and can be tracked normally. A character looking for an invisible creature might find his quarry if the invisible creature drops an item, speaks, smells strongly, leaves an obvious trail, or performs some action that makes itself known. Finding an invisible creature in this way requires a Perception check as normal. If successful, and assuming your only precise sense is vision, you become aware of the invisible creature’s presence, but you don’t know its exact location. If you’re looking for an invisible creature, the GM might rule that you have a bonus or penalty to your Perception checks based on the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items it picks up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus creating the effect of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the creature carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Invisibility does not thwart divination spells or effects. Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks (see the <em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em>). If you are or become invisible while grappled, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to escape being grappled, but you gain no other benefit against the grappler. </span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"pAWa5Xgd2QSSljyJ","name":"Energy Resistance","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with resistance to energy has the ability to ignore some energy damage of a certain type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) per attack. Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how much damage is resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage is from a mundane or magical source. If an attack deals both kinetic damage and energy damage (such as dealing 3d6 bludgeoning and 1d6 fire damage), energy resistance applies to the energy damage but doesn’t reduce the kinetic damage.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If energy resistance completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as an operative’s debilitating trick or poison delivered via an injury. Energy resistance does not negate ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels dealt along with an energy attack, nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have energy resistance against the same energy type from more than one source, the two forms of energy resistance do not stack unless the sources of the energy resistance specifically note otherwise. Rarely, an effect specifies that it increases a creature’s existing energy resistance. </span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
{"_id":"udVxysp2jvF1eMAw","name":"Incorporeal","content":"<p>CRB pg. 262</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An incorporeal creature doesn’t have a physical body. It is immune to all nonmagical kinetic attacks. All energy attacks and magical kinetic attacks deal half damage (50%) to it. An incorporeal creature takes full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as from all force effects. Corporeal spells and effects that do not cause damage have only a 50% chance of affecting an incorporeal creature. An incorporeal creature is immune to critical hits.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Incorporeal creatures’ attacks always target their enemies’ Energy Armor Class. Incorporeal creatures cannot take any physical actions that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, including combat maneuvers, nor are they subject to any such actions.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects but must remain adjacent to such an object’s exterior, and so it cannot pass through the center of an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within squares adjacent to its current location (see page 260), but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance; see Concealment on page 253) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it has only cover (see Cover starting on page 253). An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in vacuum, water, and zero gravity as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. They have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered only by weight.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Incorporeal creatures move silently and cannot be heard with Perception checks unless they wish to be. Any sense (including blindsense or blindsight) based on scent, sound, or touch is ineffective at perceiving incorporeal creatures. These creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see. </span></p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}

{"_id":"zq2Ef65I1u5JuM2o","name":"Sample Dynamic Hacking Objectives","content":"<h1>Sample Objectives</h1>\n<p>The following are common objectives, including adaptations of existing modules and countermeasures from the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">BASIC COUNTERHACKER (COUNTERMEASURE)</span></h3>\n<p>This capable programmer shores up the computer’s defenses.<br /><strong>Resolve:</strong> Deceive (DC + 0, 2 successes) or Hack (DC + 2, 2 successes)<br /><strong>Countdown</strong> (3): Whenever the countdown reaches 0, the counterhacker causes two effects. First, they damage the persona of one lead hacker, causing it to lose CP equal to 2d6 + the encounter’s CR. That lead hacker can halve the CP their persona lost by succeeding at a DC + 0 Process check. Second, the counterhacker can perform one of the actions below. Afterward, roll 1d3 to determine the obstacle’s new countdown value.</p>\n<p><em>Attack:</em> Increase the Process check DC to resist the damage by 2, and treat all 1s on the damage dice as 2s.</p>\n<p><em>Infect:</em> The counterhacker infects the persona with a virus. Each phase after the hackers act, the infected persona loses CP equal to 1d6 plus half the encounter’s CR, and any computer that persona’s hacker is using takes damage equal to twice the CP lost. The virus can be removed by spending a major action and succeeding at a DC + 0 Hack check.<br /><em>Repair:</em> Choose one obstacle that hasn’t been resolved. Treat one of the checks to resolve that obstacle as though it had not been fulfilled this encounter.</p>\n<p><em>Trace: </em>The counterhacker assesses the persona’s signature and identifies where its associated hacker is located unless that hacker succeeds at a DC + 0 Deceive check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">NODE, BASIC (NODE)</span></h3>\n<p>The collection of file paths requires some effort to navigate and secure permission to restricted areas beyond.</p>\n<p><em>Resolve: </em>Hack (DC – 2, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success) Support: Perception</p>\n<p><em>Success:</em> Add the node’s linked obstacles to the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">NODE, FAKE SHELL (NODE)</span></h3>\n<p>This node misleads hackers toward a falsified set of files. <em>Resolve: </em>Hack (DC – 2, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success)</p>\n<p><em>Support:</em> Perception</p>\n<p><em>Success:</em> Add the node’s linked obstacles to the encounter.</p>\n<p><em>Special:</em> If the Process check to resolve this obstacle doesn’t exceed the DC by 5 or more, the linked obstacles are convincing fakes that function as normal obstacles, but resolving them provides no benefit (e.g. seemingly valuable data is worthless, command modules can’t direct devices, etc.).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">ROOT ACCESS (MODULE)</span></h3>\n<p>You secure absolute administrator privileges, allowing you to modify any of the computer’s functions with ease.</p>\n<p><em>Resolve:</em> Hack (DC + 20, 1 success), Hack (DC + 15, 1 success), Deceive (DC + 10, 1 success)</p>\n<p><em>Success:</em> You and allied hackers reduce DCs to resolve obstacles by 20 and automatically succeed at checks to analyze objectives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">SECURE DATA (MODULE)</span></h3>\n<p>This is an average-security data module with valuable contents. Large secure data modules typically require additional checks to resolve, have higher check DCs, or both.</p>\n<p><em>Resolve: </em>Hack (DC + 0, 1 success), Process (DC + 0, 1 success)</p>\n<p><em>Support:</em> Profession check related to the data</p>\n<p><em>Success:</em> Hackers can now use the modify action accompanied by specific subskill checks to delete (Hack), modify (Hack), forge (Deceive), or copy (Process) the module’s contents. As a special minor action, a hacker can study the contents with a successful DC + 0 Process check or related skill check to seek specific info or attain a basic understanding of the module’s contents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1;background-color:#000000\">WIPE (COUNTERMEASURE)</span></h3>\n<p>This program destroys important data.</p>\n<p><em>Resolve: </em>Deceive (DC + 0, 1 success), Hack (DC + 0, 1 success)</p>\n<p><em>Special: </em>Count the number of times hackers fail a check to resolve an obstacle while the wipe countermeasure is active. Once the count reaches 2 failures, this countermeasure begins erasing one or more other objectives, imposing a –5 penalty to resolve them. At the end of the next hacking phase, those objectives are removed from the encounter and can no longer be resolved.</p>","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}
