As a result, you know the grittiest, most dangerous streets of any settlement like the back of your own hand (or other primary appendage).

You are adept at appearing as just another one of the faceless horde that populates any city. In a settlement or other urban terrain or environments (including starships, space ports, and space stations), whenever someone tries to notice you, search for you, or pick you out from the local citizens, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of any other action as long as you begin and end your movement adjacent to a creature that is not unfriendly or hostile to you, even if you do not have cover or concealment. You may do this each round if you can continue to meet this ability’s requirements.

Once you know a clue exists, you just have to find it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>TRUTH-SEEKER (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>Organizing evidence about your case and researching it refreshes you and sets you back on your path. Twice per day, you can take 10 minutes to consider and record your findings or look for new insights into them. If you do so, you regain 1 Resolve Point and can recall knowledge. If you instead take 1 hour, you regain 1 Resolve Point and can gather information.
