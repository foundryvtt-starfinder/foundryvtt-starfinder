The GM determines how much time is required to gain such access, but doing so takes at least 1d4 hours.

You know how to move among the dregs of society, and life has taught you to depend only on yourself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">1ST)</span></h2>\n<p>You grew up making your own way, without the benefits of a strong social safety net to protect and assist you. Even if your experience all comes from a single settlement, you have learned that certain roles within the slums and ghettos are, if not universal, still broadly applicable to a wide range of urban areas. As a result, you know the grittiest, most dangerous streets of any settlement like the back of your own hand (or other primary appendage). Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about local laws, the criminal underworld, rumors, and official and unofficial power players in the area (such as crime bosses, gangs, neighborhood leaders, and police) by 5.

When squeezing through or into a space that isn’t as wide as your normal space (Core Rulebook 257), you can move at your normal speed, and you are not considered entangled as a result of squeezing. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus to Acrobatics checks to escape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>BLEND IN (<span class=\"levelNum\">12TH)</span></h2>\n<p>Life has taught you that, all too often, survival depends on avoiding attention. You may have relied on petty crime to acquire food and other essentials, and learned to escape after performing a theft without raising an alarm. Or you may have lived in a place where roving gangs held far more power than formal law enforcement; to stay safe, you had to avoid bullies eager to demonstrate their unfettered power by making an example out of you. You are adept at appearing as just another one of the faceless horde that populates any city. In a settlement or other urban terrain or environments (including starships, space ports, and space stations), whenever someone tries to notice you, search for you, or pick you out from the local citizens, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of any other action as long as you begin and end your movement adjacent to a creature that is not unfriendly or hostile to you, even if you do not have cover or concealment. You may do this each round if you can continue to meet this ability’s requirements.

After all, if a thrill resulted in serious injury or even death, it’s possible you could never feel a new sensation again! Despite the risk, you refuse to let fear stop you from seeing as much of the galaxy as your limits allow. You’ve successfully survived each moment of your life so far, haven’t you? With such an optimistic outlook toward the future, you gain a +1 morale bonus to Will saving throws against fear effects. In addition, once per day when you are affected by a fear effect, as a reaction, you can delay the onset of that effect for 1 round. Once the fear starts to affect you, it then has its normal duration from that point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SENSATION JUNKY (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>New experiences fulfill and exhilarate you, stoking your enthusiasm for the wondrous galaxy you inhabit, the opportunities it presents, and all it has to offer. Twice per day, you can enjoy a new experience that takes 10 minutes or longer. As an alternative, you can spend 10 minutes or longer processing a recent new experience in some way. You might make a digital record or write in a physical journal, discuss the experience, debate whether you’d repeat it, bask in the satisfaction of fulfilling your curiosity, or engage in similar reflection. If you do so, you regain 1 Resolve Point. The time spent reflecting on your experience doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"COM page 14","type":"","modifiers":[],"abilityMod":{"ability":"con","mod":1},"skill":"per","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"TXVoX1Bx8sXUr4Ok"}

Like the sun's ineffable mass, you will not be moved from your proper mental space. You gain a +1 bonus to Will saving throws against compulsion effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>HEAT TRANSFER (<span class=\"levelNum\">12TH)</span></h2>\n<p>You have learned to thrive in the heat of the sun, and when you are burned, you can funnel some of that fiery energy into your own spells and weapons. Whenever you take fire damage, you can increase the amount of fire damage you deal as part of an attack or spell made before the end of your next turn by an amount equal to one-quarter the damage you just took (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SUN MEDITATION (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>After much practice and the occasional painful sunburn, your meditation regime has reached the peak of its potency. The light of the sun recharges you, much like it does a solar-powered battery. Up to twice per day, you can spend 10 minutes meditating while in the direct light of a sun to regain 1 Resolve Point; this doesn't count as resting to regain Stamina Points.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PWD page 17","type":"","modifiers":[],"abilityMod":{"ability":"wis","mod":1},"skill":"per","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"tPkawkkFOwpOlmkd"}
