In a universe where myth and metal coexist, lightsplayers have taken the first step in truly reverse engineering magic itself with the technology best suited for the task: holograms. Whether pumping up the crowd at a Strawberry Machine Cake concert on Songbird Station, giving a heartwarming color show for the Town’s End charitable fund on Akiton, or using their tech to throw law enforcement off their trail after a daring heist in the heart of Absalom Station, lightsplayers know it’s only the first step in the ascendency of technology to one day replace all that magic can do.</p><h1>Prerequisites</h1><p>You must have 2 ranks in both Computers and Engineering to take this archetype.</p><h1>Alternate Class Features</h1><p>The lightsplayer grants alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, and 6th levels.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.femK7RWiq1t5kN7Q]{Holographic Emitter (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2><p>You’ve created a custom toolkit for yourself called a holographic emitter. This functions as the custom rig 1st-level mechanic ability but must either be a handheld device or worn. If you already have a custom rig, you instead gain a charlatan’s wand for free. You can use your holographic emitter to replicate rudimentary spell effects that involve light, allowing you to cast dancing lights, glowing wall, and holographic interface at will, though these effects are technological rather than magical in nature. Once per day, you can also cast wisp allyas a technological effect. This increases to twice a day at 6th level and three times a day at 9th level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.NVxWBswt9cbBZ9oh]{Visual Cues (Ex) - 4th Level}</h2><p>You gain the ability to cast holographic image as a non-magical effect by spending 1 Resolve Point. The level of this spell you can cast (replicate) is equal to one-third your class level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.HCc4C7hyL3yKslGI]{Glitter Bomb (Ex) - 6th Level}</h2><p>As a standard action, you can target a 10-foot burst within 60 feet of you with a glitter bomb. This explodes harmlessly, but all creatures and objects in the area are coated with adhesive glitter, negating invisibility effects for 1 minute. All creatures in the area are dazzled for 1 round and must immediately attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your key ability modifier) or be blinded for 1 round per 2 of your character levels. Each round at the end of their turn, blinded creatures can attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.</p>"
