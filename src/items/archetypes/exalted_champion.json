You gain a powerful ability that can be activated once per day, provided you’re wearing a religious symbol corresponding to your deity. At 18th level, these abilities can be used a second time after spending 1 Resolve Point during a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>Typically, once you choose a deity for this alternate class feature, that choice can’t be changed. However, you can work with your GM to change the ability granted by this alternate class feature, typically by having your character spend a week or more in prayer and reflection geared toward the desired deity.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.s8COR4bzEPH7rgVY]{Abadar}: You can give yourself or an adjacent ally the ability to take 10 on a single d20 roll, even during combat. This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.BxLJc0Ks7vNDxbzB]{Besmara}: You automatically identify the most valuable object within your field of view as well as its magical or technological properties if its item level is no greater than your level. If you try to pick pocket or disarm this item from a target before the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to this check equal to 1/4 your level. This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.gyOyqGpy0cIdJaXw]{Damoritosh}: A celestial doshko or doshakari appears in your hands. This weapon replicates the statistics of a doshko or doshakari with a level equal to or less than your own and remains in your hands for 1 minute or until you release it, whichever comes first. This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.X8llxM9kewVluxY8]{Desna}: As a reaction, you can grant yourself a luck bonus equal to one-fifth your total level to your next d20 roll.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.NH17Wfo0QGqozzSO]{The Devourer}: You gain the ability to ignore hardness up to your level whenever you deal damage to a single creature or object for one turn.

This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.3uhp3mtUzBskKUyi]{Hylax}: You can use tongues (as per the spell) on yourself with a duration of 1 minute.

This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.rRt47rbfUTRUgltN]{Lao Shu Po}: You become invisible (as per the invisibility spell) until the end of your next turn. This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.IPYDyZpxjNAaKaax]{Nyarlathotep}: You can turn one of your limbs into a slimy tentacle until the end of your next turn. This tentacle gives you an unarmed strike that doesn’t count as archaic and threatens squares within 10 feet. Attacks with this tentacle have the grapple special property and add 1-1/2 × your character level to damage rolls. This doesn’t require you to use an action.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.7KTIZ8VFRbHb2y0j]{Oras}: You can mutate your body to grant yourself a swim, climb, or fly speed equal to your land speed for 1 minute.
