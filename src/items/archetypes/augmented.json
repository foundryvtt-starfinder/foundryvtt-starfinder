      "value": "<p>Although first a caste on Verces, the Augmented have since become a cultural movement of seeking perfection through artificial upgrades—most often cybernetics. The Augmented push the boundaries of cybernetic integration, often appearing as much machine as organic.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The Augmented grants alternate class features at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 9th levels.</p>\n<h2>Favored Augmentation (Ex) - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>Select one system of the body for which you can acquire augmentations. When you purchase and install an augmentation with an item level no greater than your character level into that system, you reduce the augmentation’s price by 50%.</p>\n<h2>Nested Augmentations (Ex) - 4th level</h2>\n<p>Whether it’s because your body is especially receptive to modification or you’re able to adjust your modifications to fit alongside one another, you can use more augmentations at once than other creatures can. You can install one additional augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation. You can have no more than two augmentations in that system, even if you have another ability that grants you a similar benefit.</p>\n<h2>Sustained by Science (Ex) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>Your technological components from augmentations grant you extraordinary resilience. Whenever you spend one or more Resolve Points, you gain an equal number of charges as though your body were a battery with a maximum capacity equal to the number of augmentations you have. You can use these charges to power any device that you own, and any unused charges disappear at a rate of 1 charge per 10 minutes. This excess energy can be used only to directly power an object, and not to recharge a battery or item.</p>\n<p>When calculating how many Resolve Points you must spend to stabilize, subtract half your number of augmentations from your maximum Resolve Points. When you spend any Resolve Points to stabilize, you can also attempt a saving throw against one bleeding or burning condition affecting you against the effect’s original DC (or if there was no save, a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the source’s CR). If you succeed at the save, the condition ends.</p>\n<h2>Overclocked Systems (Ex) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>The fusion between your natural form and your augmentations surpasses either’s intended limits. As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to choose one personal upgrade you have and gain a temporary benefit based on the ability score it augments. The benefit increases based on the model type, treating mk 1 as 1, mk 2 as 2, and mk 3 as 3 for the purpose of calculating the effect. At 13th level you can gain the associated benefits for two of your personal upgrades, and at 17th level you can gain the associated benefits for up to three of your personal upgrades. These benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your character level.</p>\n<p>Strength: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Strength upgrade’s model to all Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks. Reduce your armor check penalty by an amount equal to your model type (minimum 0).</p>\n<p>Dexterity: Each of your modes of movement increases by an amount equal to 10 ft. × your Dexterity upgrade’s model, to a maximum of twice your normal speed for each.</p>\n<p>Constitution: At the end of your turn you regain Stamina Points equal to 3 × your Constitution upgrade’s model.</p>\n<p>Intelligence: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Intelligence upgrade’s model to all Intelligence-based skill checks and ability checks. Your critical hits deal additional damage equal to 4 × your model type.</p>\n<p>Wisdom: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Wisdom upgrade’s model to all Wisdom-based skill checks and ability checks as well as to initiative checks.</p>\n<p>Charisma: You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Charisma upgrade’s model to all Charisma-based skill checks and ability checks. As a reaction, you can allow any ally that can see or hear you within 30 feet to reroll one attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Using this reaction immediately ends all of your overclocked systems benefits.</p>"
