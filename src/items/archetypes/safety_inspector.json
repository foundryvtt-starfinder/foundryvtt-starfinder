Most safety inspectors are skilled engineers, and their expertise can also apply to finding and disarming deadly traps.</p><h1>Prerequisites</h1><p>You must have 2 ranks in Perception and have paid dues on a union membership to take this archetype.</p><h1>Alternate Class Features</h1><p>The safety inspector archetype grants alternate class features at 2nd, 6th, and 12th levels.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.2fACKew0PA87uEwx]{Eye For Danger - 2nd Level}</h2><p>Whenever you come within 10 feet of a trap, you can attempt an immediate Perception check to detect the trap with a +2 insight bonus. This check should be rolled in secret by the GM.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.5dS0MKv3iVfQphqS]{Get Down! - 6th Level}</h2><p>As a reaction, when an adjacent ally must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid a damaging effect from a trap or hazard, or a triggered trap or hazard targets an adjacent ally with an attack roll, you can grant that ally a +4 insight bonus to their Reflex saving throw or AC. If you do so, you both end up prone.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.archetype-features.Item.TQzE2ORBz5LJn0Z0]{Not Today - 12th Level}</h2><p>Once per day when you fail a check to disable a trap or deal with a hazard by 5 or more, you can reroll the skill check with a +5 bonus.</p>"
