      "value": "<p>The job of a safety inspector is to ensure that a workplace is free of hazards, whether that be a short in a wire that might give a nasty shock or a shoddy support structure that could threaten to bring down an entire building. Most safety inspectors are skilled engineers, and their expertise can also apply to finding and disarming deadly traps.</p>\n<h1>Prerequisites</h1>\n<p>You must have 2 ranks in Perception and have paid dues on a union membership to take this archetype.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The safety inspector archetype grants alternate class features at 2nd, 6th, and 12th levels.</p>\n<h2>Eye For Danger - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>Whenever you come within 10 feet of a trap, you can attempt an immediate Perception check to detect the trap with a +2 insight bonus. This check should be rolled in secret by the GM.</p>\n<h2>Get Down! - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>As a reaction, when an adjacent ally must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid a damaging effect from a trap or hazard, or a triggered trap or hazard targets an adjacent ally with an attack roll, you can grant that ally a +4 insight bonus to their Reflex saving throw or AC. If you do so, you both end up prone.</p>\n<h2>Not Today - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>Once per day when you fail a check to disable a trap or deal with a hazard by 5 or more, you can reroll the skill check with a +5 bonus.</p>"
