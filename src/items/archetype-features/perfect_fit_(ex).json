While you are wearing powered armor, increase its land speed by 10 feet, up to your normal land speed, and reduce the speed adjustment from heavy armor you wear by 5 feet. In addition, reduce the armor check penalty of heavy armor or powered armor you wear by 1 (to a minimum of 0). This armor check penalty reduction stacks with reductions from other abilities, such as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.uAGN9sfUbx66jeqt]{armor training} technique of the soldier’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oHKHSbFfmBgFfvW8]{guard} fighting style.</p>"
