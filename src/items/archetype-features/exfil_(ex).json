Additionally, you can use a reaction when an ally would be targeted by a line effect, a vehicle ram or run over action, or a trample. When you do so, your ally can take a guarded step as a reaction. This sense extends to loading into mechs and vehicles. You can direct an ally who can see and hear you, or yourself, to board or disembark from a vehicle as a swift action. As a full action, you can give one ally the ability to exit a mech as a move action. Once per day as a standard action, you can give an adjacent ally the ability to enter an allied or unattended mech without using an action.</p>"
