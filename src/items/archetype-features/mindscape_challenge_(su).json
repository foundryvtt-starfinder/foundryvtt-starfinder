Once per day as a full action, you can designate a creature within 60 feet as the target of a psychic duel. That creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier) or be forced into a finite binary mindscape with you. This mindscape is a circular open plain with a radius equal to your level × 10 feet. Your mental avatar and the avatar of the targeted creature exist within the mindscape, starting the same distance apart as you are in the real world. Once the duel begins, the avatars can move in any direction they wish and no longer need to correspond to their real-world locations or distance.</p>\n<p>Your mental avatar acts immediately after you in the initiative count and has all your same statistics; the designated creature’s mental avatar functions in the same way. Both avatars are subject to the traits of the mindscape, which you define when you create the mindscape. Any damage or effects a mental avatar takes are shared with its real-world counterpart (including death). Your real-world counterpart must spend a move action each round to maintain the mindscape challenge, and you can maintain it in this way for up to a number of rounds equal to half your level + your key ability score modifier. If the real-world target of this ability moves beyond 600 feet from your real-world body, the mindscape immediately shatters. The real-world creature can spend a full action to attempt another Will save to end the effect immediately.</p>\n<p>Mindless creatures or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects cannot be targeted by this ability. This ability counts as a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
