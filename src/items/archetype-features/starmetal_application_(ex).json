After 10 minutes of uninterrupted work, you grant the item the benefit from the chosen starmetal for 24 hours, as described below. For siccatite, choose cold (for a cold benefit) or hot (for a fire benefit).</p><h3>Armor</h3><p><strong>Abysium</strong>: Reduce the usage of all upgrades by 1 (to a minimum usage of 1 for each upgrade).</p>\n<p><strong>Djezet</strong>: The wearer gains a +2 bonus to caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, which stacks with the bonus provided by djezet-enhanced armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Horacalcum</strong>: The wearer gains a +2 enhancement bonus to saves against slow and effects that alter time.</p>\n<p><strong>Inubrix</strong>: The wearer can move through solid objects (though not doors and walls) up to 5 feet thick as if incorporeal.</p>\n<p><strong>Noqual</strong>: The wearer gains spell resistance equal to 6 + your class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Siccatite</strong>: The wearer gains resistance to cold or fire equal to your class level.</p><h3>Hybrid and Technological Items</h3><p><strong>Abysium</strong>: Reduce the item’s usage by 1 (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Djezet</strong>: If the item is hybrid, its item level increases by 1. If the item is a technological item, treat it as a hybrid item.</p>\n<p><strong>Horacalcum</strong>: While the item is damaged, it regains 1 Hit Point per minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Noqual</strong>: The item gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against magical effects and spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Siccatite</strong>: The item gains immunity to cold or fire.</p><h3>Vehicles</h3><p><strong>Abysium</strong>: The vehicle gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saves against environmental effects. The vehicle’s passengers gain environmental protections as if from armor with an item level equal to your class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Djezet</strong>: The vehicle gains an autopilot system with a Piloting bonus equal to your level. A vehicle that already has such a system gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Piloting checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Horacalcum</strong>: The vehicle’s speed increases by 50 feet, its full speed by 100 feet, and its miles per hour by 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Inubrix</strong>: The vehicle’s Piloting modifier increases by 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Noqual</strong>: The vehicle gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saves against magical effects and spells. The vehicle’s passengers gain a +2 enhancement bonus to such saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Siccatite</strong>: The vehicle gains immunity to cold or fire. The vehicle’s passengers gain a +2 enhancement bonus to their AC and saves against such effects.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p><strong>Abysium</strong>: The weapon functions as if it were made of abysium. A weapon already made of abysium increases the save DC of its sickened critical hit effect by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Horacalcum</strong>: The weapon functions as if it were made of horacalcum. A weapon already made of horacalcum increases the save DC of its staggered critical hit effect by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Noqual</strong>: The weapon functions as if it were made of made of noqual. A weapon already made of noqual increases its bonus to damage rolls by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Siccatite</strong>: The weapon functions as if it were made of cold siccatite or hot siccatite. A weapon already made from siccatite increases the cold or fire damage dealt by one‑quarter your class level.</p>"
