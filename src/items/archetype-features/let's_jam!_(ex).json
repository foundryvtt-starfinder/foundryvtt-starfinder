In order to use this ability, you must have a way of broadcasting music to others. This can be through comm units linked to each other in advance, portable speakers, or turning the volume of your own personal comm unit all the way up, giving it a range of 10 feet. There must also be a medium such as air for the sound to travel in. As a move action, you play your personal soundtrack. You and all allies who can hear or feel it gain the benefits and penalties associated with your personal soundtrack. Allies can ignore both the bonuses and penalties associated with this ability (but not one or the other).</p>"
