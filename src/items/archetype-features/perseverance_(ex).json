Your bonded ally can take actions as normal on her next turn, but you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered} until the end of your next turn. To use this ability, your bonded ally must have fewer than one-quarter her maximum Resolve Points. You can use this ability if your bonded ally normally has no Resolve Points. You can’t use this ability on the same bonded ally again until you have recovered your Resolve Points after an 8-hour rest or its equivalent, but if you change the target of your combat bond ability before that, you can use this ability on the new bonded ally, provided you have Resolve Points to spend.</p>"
