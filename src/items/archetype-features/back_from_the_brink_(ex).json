You must have access to a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Item.4ANV2gtgo6zRffs3]{medkit} and use this ability within 1 minute of the creature’s death. Doing so requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work (a full action that provokes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.GtSmojwt4d6rdEkm#attack-of-opportunity]{attacks of opportunity} each round for 10 rounds). This ability cannot bring back constructs, elementals, outsiders, undead, or creatures that have died of old age. The target’s soul must be free and willing to return.</p>\n<p>The revived target has 1 Hit Point, and any ability scores reduced to 0 are raised to 1. You close all mortal wounds and repair lethal damage, but you restore no missing parts. The creature has a temporary negative level for 24 hours, and it returns with no Resolve Points, no Stamina Points, and no spell slots remaining, regaining those as normal after resting. If the creature died because of an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{affliction} (for example, an affliction with an end state of death), move that affliction one step back on the progression track. The creature continues to suffer from any @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{disease}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC#drugs]{drugs}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{poisons} still in its system when it revives.</p>"
