As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant the benefits of one feat that you have that has a “Teamwork Benefit” entry to a single ally within 30 feet that can see and hear you; the ally need not meet the feat’s prerequisites. The ally retains use of the feat until the end of your next turn, allowing you to possibly take advantage of the feat’s teamwork benefit. At 8th level, you can grant the feat’s benefits to two allies, and to three allies at 12th level; these allies must also be within 30 feet of each other.</p>"
