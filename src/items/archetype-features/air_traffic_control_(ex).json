This additional bonus increases by 1 at 12th level and again at 18th level. At the start of a vehicle chase, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to give these same bonuses to your vehicle’s initiative for the duration of the chase. As a move action when riding in a vehicle as a passenger during combat, you can give the pilot technical advice on how to drive steadily as a move action, reducing the vehicle’s attack penalty by 1 (by 2 at full speed), to a minimum 0, for 1 round. At level 12, you reduce the attack penalty by 2 (by 4 at full speed). When operating a mech, once per combat your mech can take up to three actions to move each turn instead of two.</p>\n<p>You are also skilled at combating flying foes. You can take a standard action to help your allies within 60 feet aim at a single target flying within your line of sight, giving them a +1 insight bonus to attacks against that foe.</p>"
