As a full action, you can touch up to two willing or unconscious creatures to create an empathic link between yourself and each creature touched. This empathic link lasts for 1 hour or until you end it for all creatures with a swift action. While linked, you and the linked creatures gain the effects of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.Mn5F4th3ctW5oKJ4]{status} in relation to one another.</p>\n<p>Linked creatures have an automatic emotional connection that allows them to better understand each other’s feelings as well as provide a constant and passive psychological comfort and support. Whenever a linked creature fails a Will saving throw, a different linked creature can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to allow the affected creature to reroll its failed saving throw. If the effect is an emotion or fear effect, the affected creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to this reroll. The creature must use the second result, even if it’s worse. An affected creature can reroll a given saving throw only once in this manner.</p>\n<p>Finally, you and the linked creatures learn how to anticipate each other’s needs and actions. Once per day at the beginning of combat, each linked creature can swap their initiative result with that of any other linked creature within 60 feet.</p><h2>Status</h2><p>When you need to keep track of comrades who get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general conditions. You are aware of the direction of and distance to the creatures and any conditions or states affecting them: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{Confused}, diseased, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.4MxAK5uS0zMNWhUK]{Dying}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.BVdjvpucmvQU4cc1]{Panicked}, poisoned, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, unharmed, wounded, wounded and out of Stamina points, and the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the targets, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a target leaves the plane (including via Drift travel) or dies, the spell ceases to function for that creature.</p>"
