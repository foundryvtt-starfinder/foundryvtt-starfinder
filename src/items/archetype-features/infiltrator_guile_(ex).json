If you choose Improved Feint and later gain that feat from another source, you can switch this feature to grant you improved demoralize. Improved demoralize allows you to attempt to demoralize as a move action.</p>\n<p>In addition, while in your cover identity, you can reveal your Stewards identity as part of an attempt to demoralize or feint against creatures unaware of that identity. This application of infiltrator guile is language dependent, and creatures that suddenly learn your Stewards identity must have reason to avoid, dislike, or fear the Stewards. As a full action, during which you can draw a weapon, you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.GcVVfpQ79HdcMqBt#feint]{feint} against or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i#demoralize]{demoralize} all foes within 60 feet of you who can see and hear you. If you do, roll once against a DC equal to the highest DC required to affect any one of those foes. If you feint and have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.YL1fs0mA5Gpb7sdV]{Greater Feint} feat, you can apply its benefit to only one affected foe.</p>\n<p>Revealing your Stewards identity carries risks. A creature who witnesses your Stewards identity can communicate it to others, compromising your cover. The GM can create consequences for having blown your cover identity. Further, creatures who know your Stewards identity can’t be fooled by your cover identity.</p>"
