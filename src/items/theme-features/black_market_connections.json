You can sell goods in any city for their usual price, even if the goods are illegal or too luxurious for the locals to afford. Additionally, for 10% more than the usual price, you can purchase goods to be delivered to a remote drop-off point (possibly near an adventure location) in the same solar system as a familiar city. The delivery always takes at least as long as the journey between the city and the drop-off point—and usually longer.</p>"
