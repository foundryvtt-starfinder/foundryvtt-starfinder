They might be an assistant or personal secretary, a devoted follower, a servant, a steward, or other subordinate, such as someone loyal to your aristocratic family. This NPC must be a member of a playable race, is CR 6, and uses the expert array, although they do not gain any special abilities from their array. They do not have a class graft, but they are equipped with light armor (item level 6 or lower), one small arm (item level 6 or lower), and a basic melee weapon (item level 5 or lower). The retainer does not always follow you around and is not meant to accompany you on adventures or in combat. (If your personal retainer is with you when combat breaks out, they fight defensively and move to get out of the way and avoid lines of fire.) Instead, they run various errands for you while you are adventuring, delivering messages, attending to your business, maintaining your home or living quarters on your starship, and ensuring that your stipend is spent according to your desires. If your retainer ever dies, you can hire and train a replacement after 1 week, but you must supply your new retainer with their gear.</p>"
