While at times you find yourself longing for home, your new adopted home and family groups bring you a sense of comfort and stability that bolsters you and gives you a reason to fight on. Select a new home world for your PC, which can’t be the same as your character’s place of birth and upbringing. Up to twice per day, when you spend 10 minutes contemplating the positive aspects of your newfound home, you recover 1 Resolve Point. This doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. You must stipulate where this new home is when you reach this level; you aren’t able to change this selection once it has been made.</p>"
