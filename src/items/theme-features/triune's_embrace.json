Many cultures recognize this unique level of attunement as a true sign of the machine god’s favor. While in the Drift, you can breathe normally, don’t suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum, don’t experience decompression (Core Rulebook 394) by suddenly transitioning into a vacuum, and don’t need to eat or drink. For up to 1 hour per day, you can also apply these protections (except the need to eat and drink) while in the vacuum of space while not in the Drift. You don’t need to spend this duration consecutively, but you must do so in 5-minute intervals.</p>"
