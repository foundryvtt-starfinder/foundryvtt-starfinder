You, in turn, can sense the faith the public puts in you, and this rejuvenates you. The simple fact that you are trusted by those you are sworn to protect gives you the strength to carry on in the face of injustice. Twice per day, you can spend at least 10 minutes interacting with the people you serve, gaining trust and developing a rapport with community members. If you do so, you gain 1 Resolve Point. This doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. In addition, after such interaction, you can spend another 10 minutes to gather information from nearby citizens. If you do, you can attempt a @Check[type:diplomacy] for that task, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.</p>"
