Whenever someone needs assistance, you can seize the opportunity to help. You know that this not only builds the trust in whomever you’re assisting, it also develops social capital that you can cash in far into the future. What’s more, helping out positions you to better swoop in to the rescue and take the credit if your companions fail. Once per minute when you attempt to aid another creature’s skill check, you can roll twice and take the better result. If you exceed the check to aid by at least 10, and the creature you aided fails their skill check, you gain a +2 morale bonus to your next skill check within the next minute to attempt the same task that the creature failed.</p>"
