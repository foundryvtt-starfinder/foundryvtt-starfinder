You may have relied on petty crime to acquire food and other essentials, and learned to escape after performing a theft without raising an alarm. Or you may have lived in a place where roving gangs held far more power than formal law enforcement; to stay safe, you had to avoid bullies eager to demonstrate their unfettered power by making an example out of you. You are adept at appearing as just another one of the faceless horde that populates any city. In a settlement or other urban terrain or environments (including starships, space ports, and space stations), whenever someone tries to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP#notice]{notice} you, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP#search]{search} for you, or pick you out from the local citizens, you can attempt a @Check[type:stealth] to hide as part of any other action as long as you begin and end your movement adjacent to a creature that is not unfriendly or hostile to you, even if you do not have @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Kjba2E3Ad5oMJ7hV.JournalEntryPage.1jkwbVTGQihSpCrL]{cover} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Kjba2E3Ad5oMJ7hV.JournalEntryPage.nyB6pt2dd6iVQGmS]{concealment}. You may do this each round if you can continue to meet this abilityâ€™s requirements. If you move more than half your speed, make an attack, or take a standard or full action, you immediately stop being hidden and cannot use this ability again until you have cover or concealment for at least 1 full round.</p>"
