This taught you a lot about the different ways that people across the galaxy live their lives. Reduce the DC to identify or recall knowledge about previously unfamiliar cultures or ways of life by 5. Survival is a class skill for you. If it’s a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation.</p>"
