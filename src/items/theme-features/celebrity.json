Among those who follow your iconic profession, you’ve built up both fans and detractors due to your celebrity. If you’re looking for a generic person like “a doctor who can treat this disease,” you can almost always find one who’s a fan and whose attitude starts as friendly or helpful to you; this takes [[/r 2d4]]{2d4 hours}. At the GM’s discretion, fans might give you services (although not goods) for a discount or even for free.</p>"
