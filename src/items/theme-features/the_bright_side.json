No one soul is an island; your goals can only be achieved together. By rousing people into action, you can motivate people in rebuilding damaged settlements, cement two warring nations into a binding peace treaty, or take advantage of a rival gang’s lost weapon smuggling routes to launch the perfect assault. Up to twice per day, when you convince someone to act in a manner that would turn a negative event into a positive outcome for themselves or others (including you), you recover 1 Resolve Point.</p>"
