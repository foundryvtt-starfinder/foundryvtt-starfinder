If you succeed by 5 or more, you glean three pieces of information about the communication, such as the identity of its source, its general nature, the emotional state of the sender or the recipient, and so on. If you succeed by 10 or more, you can listen in on the communication by concentrating each round (a standard action) to maintain your eavesdropping. However, although unaware of your spying, the subject can attempt a saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) to prevent it. Succeeding by 5 or more at this save also alerts the subject to your snooping.</p>"
