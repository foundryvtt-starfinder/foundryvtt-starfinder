If you use this ability as a reaction to an attack and your Acrobatics check result exceeds your opponent’s attack roll result, the attack misses you. If you use this ability as a reaction when you must attempt a Reflex saving throw, you can use your Acrobatics check result as your Reflex save result. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. After you use this ability, you are staggered on your next turn.</span></p>",
