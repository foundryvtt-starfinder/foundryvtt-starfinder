You can use this ability on one target creature per character level, all of which must be within range of your telepathy. If you succeed at an Intimidate check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 Ã— the CR of the highest CR target), all targets are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC. This is a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Mind-affecting} effect. Once you have targeted a creature with this feat, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>"
