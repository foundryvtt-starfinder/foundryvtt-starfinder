You do not take any of the selected conditions’ penalties to skill checks or attack rolls, do not take nonlethal damage from them, and do not need to attempt saving throws to resist their effects. Once these condition choices are made, they cannot be changed. If your Constitution bonus increases from an effect that does not have a limited duration, you can add additional conditions to your list.</span></p>",
