If you succeed, the foe is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} and takes a –2 penalty to all skill checks for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC, or until it makes an attack against you, forces you to attempt a saving throw, or damages you (whichever comes first). Once you have attempted to antagonize a foe, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Language-dependent} ability.</span></p>",
