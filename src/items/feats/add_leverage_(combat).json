If you use a trip combat maneuver against a flying opponent, you can increase the distance that creature descends by 5 feet for each additional hand used to wield your weapon. Changing your grip to alter the number of hands you are wielding a weapon with is a swift action. You can’t hold items in hands used to add leverage, or use them for any other purpose.</p>"
