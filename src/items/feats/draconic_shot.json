As part of a full round attack, add your breath weapon’s damage and energy type to a weapon you’re wielding. You can energize a willing ally’s ranged weapon using your breath weapon as a standard action. The weapon deals this additional damage on its next attack. A weapon affected by Draconic Shot gains the unwieldy property until fired, and it must be fired within 1 minute or the breath weapon’s energy dissipates and is lost.</p>"
