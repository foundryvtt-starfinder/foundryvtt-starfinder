When you do so, you attempt a Disguise check in place of a Bluff check to determine the results of your feint; this doesn’t include any additional bonuses the disguise ability grants, such as the +10 bonus to Disguise checks when casting disguise self.</p>\n<p>Once a creature observes you using Morphing Feint (whether or not your feint is successful), that creature is immune to further uses of your Morphing Feint for 1 hour unless you also spend 1 Resolve Point when using Morphing Feint against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you also have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.11cfGGiQ9oTi4f9G]{Improved Feint} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Na3uzNO5IH4xQ4ku]{Flashmorph} feats, you can combine the effects of Morphing Feint with any effect that allows you to disguise yourself as part of a move or full action (such as from the Flashmorph feat). If you do so while performing a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{trick attack}, you attempt a Disguise check with a +4 bonus to resolve the trick attack instead of using any other skill. If you have these two feats as well as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.YMCpBDLSA6feLBen]{clever feint} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.tL68g6bfFLpA9JMF]{clever attack} envoy improvisations, once per minute when you use either improvisation, you can also disguise yourself as part of that action with an item, spell, or ability you could use as a standard action.</p>"
