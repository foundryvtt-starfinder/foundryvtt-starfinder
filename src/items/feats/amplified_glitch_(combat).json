You can use this ability on one target creature per character level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each target must either be carrying technological devices or be within sight and hearing of such devices. While the locations of such devices are up to the GM, most public spaces (aside from technologically underdeveloped areas) contain enough technology for this feat to function. Your glitch causes alarms to go off, automated devices to spin and flail, readouts to flash brightly, and so on. With a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 Ã— the CR of the highest-CR target), all targets are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">Once you have targeted a creature with this feat, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</span></p>",
