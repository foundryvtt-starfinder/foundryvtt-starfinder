If you do, allies who are surprised but can hear you don’t gain the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed} condition, while allies who aren’t surprised gain a +1 insight bonus to initiative checks. You gain the appropriate benefit depending on whether you are surprised or not. However, your scream is loud, possibly drawing the attention of foes that can hear you and alerting others within earshot. You’re also @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} until the end of your next turn.</span></p>"
