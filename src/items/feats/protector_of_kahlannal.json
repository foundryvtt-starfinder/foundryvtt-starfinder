As a standard action, you can summon your chariot from a distance of up to 1 mile. If you do so, the vehicle moves toward you on autopilot as quickly as it can, unless an insurmountable obstacle stands between you. If you become chaotic or evil, you lose access to this feat while you have such an alignment.</p>"
