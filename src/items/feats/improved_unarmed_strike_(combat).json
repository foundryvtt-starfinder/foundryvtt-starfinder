Your unarmed strikes don’t count as archaic and can deal lethal damage. You threaten squares within your natural reach with your unarmed strikes even when you do not have a hand free for an unarmed strike. If you are immobilized, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}, or unable to use both legs (or whatever appendages you have in place of legs, where appropriate), you lose the ability to make unarmed strikes without your hands. When making an unarmed strike without your hands, you can’t use such attacks for combat maneuvers or similar abilities—only to deal damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong>: You don’t threaten any squares with unarmed strikes, and you must have a hand free to make an unarmed strikes.</p>"
