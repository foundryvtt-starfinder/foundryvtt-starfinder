If you hit the targeted intersection and your damage roll exceeds the hardness of the material of the chosen square, that square becomes difficult terrain. This is in addition to the normal effects of the weapon.You have trained to make your unarmed attacks lethal and strike with kicks, head-butts, and similar attacks.</p>"
