If your attack roll is higher than the attack roll that hit you, you deflect the attack with your weapon, and it misses. This doesn’t work against area attacks, even against area attacks that have attack rolls like blast weapons, and you can’t use this reaction if you aren’t capable of making an attack with an appropriate weapon.</p>"
