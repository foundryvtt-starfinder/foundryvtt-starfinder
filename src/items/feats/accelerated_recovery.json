In addition, for each uninterrupted 8 hours of rest you receive, you recover from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} as though you had rested for a full day. This effect does not stack with other effects that increase these rates of healing and recovery; if more than one would apply, you choose which one takes effect.</p>"
