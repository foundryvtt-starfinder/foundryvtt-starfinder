(See Injury and Death beginning on page 250 for more information.) You can also die from ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels (see page 252), or by taking massive damage (see page 250).</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are dead, your soul leaves your body and you are unable to act in any way. You can&rsquo;t benefit from normal or magical healing, but you can be restored to life via magic or technology capable of such a feat. Your dead body decays normally unless it is preserved, but anything that restores you to life also restores your body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device that&rsquo;s reviving you). Either way, you need not worry about decomposition, rigor mortis, and other conditions that affect dead bodies after you are resurrected.</h3>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
