      "value": "<p>An invisible creature is visually undetectable. A creature using only an imprecise sense, or whose only precise sense is vision, can’t observe an invisible creature, so the invisible creature is unseen by such a would-be observer. Creatures with @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#blindsight]{Blindsight} can perceive invisible creatures normally, since blindsight is a precise sense that does not rely on vision, and thus can observe invisible creatures. See @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.7MyEhuifQLwaPZ8e]{Senses} on page 260 and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.7MyEhuifQLwaPZ8e.JournalEntryPage.eRuw7PyvI33WDzvu#dealing-with-unseen-creatures]{Dealing with Unseen Creatures} on page 261 for more information.</p>\n<p>Invisible creatures remain invisible even in unusual environments, such as underwater, and when subject to effects such as fog or smoke. They are not magically silenced. They can still be heard, smelled, and felt as normal, even if other creatures can’t see them. Invisible creatures leave tracks and can be tracked normally. A character looking for an invisible creature might find his quarry if the invisible creature drops an item, speaks, smells strongly, leaves an obvious trail, or performs some action that makes itself known. Finding an invisible creature in this way requires a Perception check as normal. If successful, and assuming your only precise sense is vision, you become aware of the invisible creature’s presence, but you don’t know its exact location. If you’re looking for an invisible creature, the GM might rule that you have a bonus or penalty to your Perception checks based on the situation.</p>\n<p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items it picks up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus creating the effect of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the creature carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p>\n<p>Invisibility does not thwart divination spells or effects. Invisible creatures cannot use @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.universal-creature-rules.lZnbqFTZ9QWILhVL]{Gaze} attacks (see the Starfinder Alien Archive). If you are or become invisible while @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled}, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to escape being grappled, but you gain no other benefit against the grappler.</p>\n<p><em>While Invisible technically isn't a condition rules as written, it has been included as such for simplicity's sake with regard to vision in Foundry.</em></p>"
