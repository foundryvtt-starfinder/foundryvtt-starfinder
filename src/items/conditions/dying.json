Creatures at 0 Hit Points that have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions and loses 1 Resolve Point each round at the end of its turn unless it is stabilized. A dying creature can spend 3 RP to stabilize and can then spend another RP in a subsequent round to gain 1 Hit Point and stay in the fight. Stabilizing or being healed above 0 Hit Points ends the dying condition, as does death. See Injury and Death on page 250 for more information.</h3>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
