For information about the hardness and Hit Points of armor and weapons, see page 409.</p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the item is a <strong>weapon</strong>, any attacks made with the item take a –2 penalty to attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Such weapons can’t deal extra critical effects on a critical hit but still deal double damage.</p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, can be resold for only half the normal resale value (usually 5% of the item’s purchase price).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any item can be repaired with a mending or make whole spell cast by a character with a caster level equal to or higher than the item’s level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original Hit Points or higher.</p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, magic items can be repaired with the Mysticism skill (see page 143 for more details), and technological items can be repaired with the Engineering skill (see page 141 for more details).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hybrid items can be repaired with either skill.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most repair shops (magical or technological) charge 10% of the item’s original purchase price to repair such damage (or more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).</p>",
