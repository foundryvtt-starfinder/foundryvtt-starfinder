  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.skills.Skills Summary]</p>\n<p>You can use certain skills to identify creatures. The skill used to identify each creature type is listed below and in the individual skill descriptions. A successful skill check allows you to recall a useful piece of information about a specific creature, such as its special powers or vulnerabilities. For every 5 points by which the result of your check exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information. You can attempt untrained skill checks to identify a creature if the DC is 10 or less. You can take 20 on a check to identify a creature, but only if you have a means of performing research, such as access to an information network like a planetary infosphere or a downloaded data set (see page 430); this typically takes 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>The DCs for skill checks to identify creatures are based on the creature’s rarity.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CREATURE RARITY</td>\n<td>DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very common (space goblin)</td>\n<td>5 + 1-1/2 × creature’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average (most monsters)</td>\n<td>10 + 1-1/2 × creature’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rare (novaspawn)</td>\n<td>15 + 1-1/2 × creature’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The list of creature types below indicates which skill is used to identify each creature type.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CREATURE TYPE</td>\n<td>SKILL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aberration</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Animal</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Construct (magical)</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Construct (technological)</td>\n<td>Engineering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dragon</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fey</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Humanoid</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Magical beast</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monstrous humanoid</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ooze</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outsider</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plant</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Undead</td>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vermin</td>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
