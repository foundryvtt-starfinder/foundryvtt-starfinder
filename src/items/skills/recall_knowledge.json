  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.skills.Skills Summary]</p>\n<p>You can use certain skills to recall knowledge about specific topics. The topics a given skill relates to are detailed in the individual skill descriptions. A successful skill check allows you to answer questions about the topic in question. You can attempt untrained skill checks to recall knowledge if the DC is 10 or less. You can take 20 on this check, but only if you have a means of researching, such as access to an information network or downloaded data set (see page 430); this typically takes 2 minutes.</p>\n<p>The DCs for skill checks to recall knowledge are determined by the GM and are based on how well known the piece of knowledge is, using the following guidelines.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>QUESTION DIFFICULTY</td>\n<td>BASE DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Really easy questions</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average questions</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very difficult questions</td>\n<td>20 to 30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The specific topics and the skills you use to recall knowledge about them are listed in the small table below.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SKILL</td>\n<td>RECALLED KNOWLEDGE TOPICS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Culture</td>\n<td>A culture's customs, laws, government,<br />leaders, prominent inhabitants, legends,<br />religion, history, and related topics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Life Science</td>\n<td>Bioengineering, biology, botany, ecology,<br />genetics, xenobiology, zoology, and other<br />fields of biological science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mysticism</td>\n<td>Alchemical theory, arcane symbols, deities,<br />magic traditions, the planes, religious<br />traditions and symbols, and related topics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Physical Science</td>\n<td>Astronomy, chemistry, climatology,<br />geography, geology, hyperspace,<br />meteorology, oceanography, physics, and<br />other fields of natural science</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Profession</td>\n<td>A specific profession and related topics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
