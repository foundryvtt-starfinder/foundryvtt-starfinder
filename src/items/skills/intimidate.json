  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.skills.Skills Summary]</p>\n<h2>INTIMIDATE (CHA)</h2>\n<p>You can rattle your foes or bully them to do what you want with verbal threats or displays of prowess.</p>\n<h3>BULLY</h3>\n<p>You can use Intimidate to bully a creature to temporarily change its attitude to helpful (see Diplomacy on page 139). This is a language-dependent, sense-dependent ability. You must spend at least 1 minute conversing with the creature. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Intimidate skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, the creature gives you information it has that you want, takes actions that do not endanger it, or grants limited assistance that you request, but does so under duress. Such a change in attitude lasts for 1d6 × 10 minutes. At the end of this time, the creature’s attitude toward you becomes unfriendly. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the creature’s attitude becomes unfriendly, or hostile if it was already unfriendly. If the creature becomes unfriendly due to a failed check, it is likely to try to deceive you or otherwise hinder your goals.</p>\n<h3>DEMORALIZE</h3>\n<p>As a standard action, you can use Intimidate to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to become shaken for a number of rounds. This is a sense-dependent ability. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Intimidate skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, the target is shaken for 1 round. The duration increases by 1 round for every 5 by which the result of your check exceeds the DC.</p>",
