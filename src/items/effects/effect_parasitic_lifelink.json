Whenever the target regains Hit Points, they instead regain only half as many Hit Points (rounded up), and you gain the other half (rounded down). If this would increase your Hit Point total above its maximum, any excess Hit Points you would gain from this spell instead restore an equal number of Stamina Points; any Hit Points you would regain from this spell while you are uninjured are lost. Parasitic lifelink can transfer a maximum number of Hit Points equal to 3 Ã— your caster level, after which the spell ends immediately.</span></p>\n<p><em>This effect currently has no automation because its effect is not supported by the system yet, and instead it just serves as a reminder that it is applied.</em></p>"
