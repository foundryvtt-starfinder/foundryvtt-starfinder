A character who is poisoned attempts a saving throw after the listed onset and at the listed frequency thereafter. Upon initial exposure, regardless of whether she succeeds at her saving throw, the victim loses a number of Hit Points equal to the poison&rsquo;s DC &ndash; 10. If a victim is exposed to multiple doses of the same poison, she must attempt a separate save for each dose and progresses to the next state on the poison track with each failed save. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"framing\">Strength Poison Track</h1>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Staggered&mdash;Immobile&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Weakened</h3>\n<p>The victim takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Strength-based ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks, and the DCs of his spells and special abilities decrease by 2.

However, the user doesn&rsquo;t lose Hit Points, even if the drug functions as a Constitution poison. Taking a drug also exposes the user to the addiction disease (see page 418), with a DC that depends on how addictive the drug is. If a character is dosed with a drug against his will, he can attempt a Fortitude save against the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug}&rsquo;s DC. If he succeeds, this negates both the drug&rsquo;s beneficial and negative effects, as well the chance for addiction. Immunity to poison or a similar effect prevents a character from experiencing the drug&rsquo;s beneficial effects, and removing or suppressing a drug&rsquo;s negative effects with restorative spells also cancels the benefits.</span></p>",
