To recharge the full capacity of a spent battery or power cell takes 1 round per charge and costs half the price of the battery or cell. You can recharge a partially depleted battery or cell, but the price for doing so is the same as if it were fully spent. At the GM’s discretion, some larger starships might have onboard recharging stations. These might offer recharging at low or no cost, but they typically take 1 minute per charge to recharge a battery or power cell.</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_Header2\"><br /></span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_Header2\"><br /></span></p>\n<div>\n<table id=\"ctl00_MainContent_GridViewOtherItems\" style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:58.9158%\" scope=\"col\">Name</th>\n<th style=\"width:41.0842%\" scope=\"col\">Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:58.9158%\"> Recharging Stations, 1 round/charge</td>\n<td style=\"width:41.0842%\"> 1/2 price of battery or cell</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",
