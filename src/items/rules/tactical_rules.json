After initial steps that begin a battle, every character acts in turn through a regular cycle of rounds until the combat ends. Regardless of how it plays out, combat follows this sequence.</p><p><strong>1. Determining Awareness:</strong> The GM establishes whether any combatant is surprised when combat breaks out. PCs and NPCs usually attempt Perception checks to determine whether they are aware that a fight has started.</p><p><strong>2. Determining Initiative Order:</strong> The GM and players roll initiative checks for those characters able to act. In combat, characters will act in order of their initiative check results— also known as their initiative counts—from highest to lowest. This order is called the initiative order.</p><p><strong>3. Surprise Round:</strong> If some but not all of the characters are surprised, combat begins with a surprise round, during which only characters who aren’t surprised can act and their choice of actions is limited (see @UUID[.quDJrqnO6LL0W61v]{Surprise} on page 239). After the surprise round, if any, the GM and players roll initiative checks for any characters that have not yet done so. The GM inserts these characters into the initiative order based on their initiative counts.</p><p><strong>4. First Normal Combat Round:</strong> All characters act according to initiative order. The full suite of options is available to the combatants when they act, including moving and attacking.</p><p><strong>5. Continuing Combat:</strong> After all the characters have had a turn, the next normal combat round begins and characters again act in the initiative order determined for this combat. Step 5 then repeats until the combat ends. If a new character enters combat, she rolls an initiative check to determine her initiative count, and the GM inserts her into the established initiative order.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 238</p><p>When a combatant enters battle, she rolls an initiative check to determine when she’ll act in each combat round relative to the other characters. An initiative check is a d20 roll to which a character adds her Dexterity modifier plus any other modifiers from feats, spells, and other effects. The result of a character’s initiative check is referred to as her initiative count. The GM determines a combat’s initiative order by organizing the characters’ initiative counts in descending order. During combat, characters act in initiative order, from highest initiative count to lowest initiative count; their relative order typically remains the same throughout the combat.</p><p>If two or more combatants have the same initiative count, the order in which they act is determined by their total initiative modifiers (the character with the highest modifier acts first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should each roll a d20, and whoever rolls highest goes first. This final method of determining which character’s initiative order is earlier is often referred to as “rolling off.” However, if the GM allows it, characters whose initiative results are a tie might decide among themselves which character acts first based on strategies or other tactical factors.</p><p>A character rolls to determine her initiative count only once in each combat. Even if a character can’t take actions—for example, if she’s is under the effect of a hold person spell or is otherwise paralyzed—the character retains her initiative count for the duration of the encounter. The exception is when a character takes an action that results in her initiative changing (see the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.PiWpd7yZ4sLOkphL#ready-an-action]{Ready an Action} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.PiWpd7yZ4sLOkphL#delay]{Delay} on page 249).</p><p>Any characters who enter combat after it has already begun roll initiative checks when they first enter combat.

When a character’s turn comes up in the initiative order, that character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. For some exceptions, see Other Actions on page 249; for example, delaying can change the order in which you take your turn. Regardless, in a normal combat round on her turn, a character can perform either a full action or a handful of shorter actions (see @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL]{Actions in Combat} on page 244 for more details about the actions characters can take).</p><p>When the rules refer to a “full round,” they usually mean a span of time from a particular initiative count in one round to the same initiative count in the next round.
