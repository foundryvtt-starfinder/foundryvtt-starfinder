Others must find a new place to live because of global disaster or simple—and shortsighted— pollution of the atmosphere.</p><p>Even when a suitable planet is discovered, it can take a long time for settlers to reach it; faster-than-light travel means a far-off settlement might be only weeks away, but preparation can take months or years.

Unforeseen events can wipe out a settlement altogether, but if the people thrive, they can grow into a powerful political entity.</p><p>In the Starfinder RPG, these settlements on distant planets are called charters, and the Charter Development subsystem represents the effort to land on a world, build a home, and develop it to accommodate thousands of citizens. Use this system when the PCs act as administrators of a charter (usually granted to them by a government or corporation) to establish in an area otherwise devoid of sapient life, such as a planet or moon. With this system, the PCs make decisions that grow the charter and guide its development. Will they succeed? Or will the citizens oust them when unrest grows too high?</p>",

These five traits are prerequisites for advanced charter projects and events, both of which are introduced on page 45 and further expanded upon in pages 46–47 (for advanced projects) and 48–49 (for events). Each charter trait has an abbreviation noted in parentheses.</p><p>Each charter trait score starts at 0, but your selection of patron type and initial focus (steps 2 and 3 of charter creation) will increase or decrease these scores. Charter trait scores can be negative. Some choices, including the free choices in Step 4: Finalize Trait Scores, allow you to increase a score of your choice. You can’t increase the same score twice in the same step of charter creation, but you can use an increase gained in one step to offset a decrease from the same step.</p><p>As you undertake projects, these scores will further increase and decrease.</p><h3>Accord (ACC)</h3><p>Accord measures the collective sense of togetherness possessed by the citizens of your charter, generally as a function of the charter’s infrastructure.</p><h3>Culture (CUL)</h3><p>Culture measures the interest and dedication of your charter and its people in the arts and related fields as well as religion and philosophy.</p><h3>Economy (ECO)</h3><p>Economy measures the practical day-to-day business of your charter and its ability to create, buy, and sell.</p><h3>Magic (MAG)</h3><p>Magic measures how deeply your charter delves into the mysteries of the arcane.</p><h3>Technology (TEC)</h3><p>Technology indicates the level of manufacturing and scientific research your charter engages in.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> AP #40 pg. 41</p><p>Follow these steps to create your charter.</p><h2>Step 1: Charter Concept And Charter Sheet</h2><p>The first step to making and building a charter is for the player group to decide what they want their new home to be like. Are you going to focus on economic development, ignoring the potential damage to nature and the environment? Or perhaps your focus is on magic and venerating one or more deities? The group should work together to determine what direction they want to take their burgeoning new home. Compared to creating a single character, developing a charter is, by its nature, a cooperative experience enhanced when the entire group engages in the process.</p><p>The details of your charter are tracked on the charter sheet. The GM and players should work together to determine the best method for sharing the responsibility of tracking their charter. Should the GM keep track of everything? Should one player—the one who most enjoys learning a new subsystem or whose character takes on the most administrative duties—be responsible for filling out the charter sheet? Perhaps the sheet should be passed from one player to the next each session? As long as the charter’s details are available to everyone during play, there’s no one “right” answer, so choose the solution that works best for the group.</p><h2>Step 2: Select Patron Type</h2><p>Starting a new settlement on a distant planet presents a daunting challenge, requiring significant amounts of money and support. By selecting a patron or sponsor, the charter gains that much-needed initial funding. Your patron increases the score for two of your charter traits, but another trait score is reduced to represent your debt to an outside party. Rather than include every possible organization that might serve as patron to a charter, the list below groups patrons into types based on their priorities and what the patron wants from the colony they’re supporting. Once you’ve chosen your patron type, apply the listed trait adjustments to your charter.</p><p>The method by which the PCs secure a patron can vary from campaign to campaign at the GM’s discretion; they could have a patron assigned to them at 1st level, recruit one by spreading the word of their intent to travel to a distant planet, or earn their patron after doing a big favor for a powerful NPC. In the Horizons of the Vast Adventure Path, the PCs choose from one of several specific patrons found on page 53.</p><p>After you’ve chosen a patron type, you can’t change it later. Over time, your charter might grow more independent, or you could secure additional aid and support from other charters, but none of those developments will replace or adjust the important initial increases and decreases derived from your initial choice of patron type.</p><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Your patron wants a settlement that uses magic to preserve harmony with the natural environment, which hampers your technological development.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Magic, +1 free, –1 Technology</p><h3>Expansion</h3><p>Your patron is part of a large empire that wants to gain a foothold on your charter’s planet or even include the planet within its borders. Your settlers are particularly devoted to this cause, and they have little time for arcane theory.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Accord, +1 free, –1 Magic</p><h3>Experimental</h3><p>Your patron has put out a call for great minds to work together on a scientific project of great import. Your patron helps to secure the charter’s initial research facilities and supplies at the cost of incurring considerable debt.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Technology, +1 free, –1 Economy</p><h3>Exploration</h3><p>Your sponsor wants you to survey the wilderness around your charter for relics of the past and other interesting discoveries. This focus brings in settlers interested in cultural knowledge, but their differing methods and results often clash.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Culture, +1 free, –1 Accord</p><h3>Grant</h3><p>Your patron grants you a large amount of funds and resources and has no real expectations concerning how you develop your charter. However, they demand final say over the list of settlers allowed to join the charter, and many of these settlers just want to get rich.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Economy, +1 free, –1 Culture</p><h3>Open</h3><p>While patronage offers a simple in-universe explanation for how and why the PCs establish their charter, it also ties them—for better or worse—to an outside authority. If the PCs would prefer to be truly free agents and trailblazers staking their own claim, they can simply choose an open charter with no restrictions—and no direct support.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 free</p><h2>Step 3: Choose Initial Focus</h2><p>As you administer according to your charter’s needs, you direct how it expands and choose the major projects undertaken by its citizens. However, the first few weeks after touching down on a planet’s surface are crucial to a charter’s survival. Decide on your initial focus during this early period, selecting one of the focuses listed below and applying the listed adjustments to your charter trait scores. Your choice of initial focus doesn’t restrict your future choices or the projects you pursue during charter turns; it represents only your charter’s initial emphasis when your PCs and the citizens they brought with them hit the ground for the first time.</p><h3>Aesthetics</h3><p>You focus on providing citizens a comfortable place to live and work that’s also pleasing to the eye.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Culture</p><h3>Community</h3><p>You want settlers to get along with one another. After all, this is their new home!</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Accord</p><h3>Production</h3><p>It’s vital to you that every citizen has a job to do and contributes to the charter’s future.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Economy</p><h3>Research</h3><p>You consider it important to learn as much as possible about this new world and its native species.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Technology</p><h3>Thaumaturgy</h3><p>Every planet has occult secrets, and you intend to discover them before they cause any harm.</p><p>Trait Adjustments: +1 Magic</p><h2>Step 4: Finalize Trait Scores</h2><p>Finalize your charter’s trait scores by adding +1 to two different traits.</p><h2>Step 5: Establish First Settlement</h2><p>The first settlement of your charter can be placed in any hex on the planet (subject to GM approval) that you have reconnoitered and in which you’ve defeated all significant encounters. Some projects can only be undertaken in hexes with a specific terrain; review the list of charter projects on pages 46–47, check out the Early Advice sidebar on page 44, and plan accordingly!</p><h2>Step 6: Record Charter Details</h2><p>Record your charter’s trait scores on the Charter Development sheet (page 49). Additional charter details are listed below, including your charter’s size, which is a single hex at this stage. The GM might give you a choice of hexes to pick from for your initial settlement, assign you a specific hex, or allow you to pick anywhere on the map.</p><ul><li><p>Your charter’s size is 1.</p></li><li><p>Your Settlement Die is a d6.</p></li><li><p>The maximum item level your charter can provide is 4.</p></li><li><p>Your Unrest score is 0.</p></li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> AP #40 pg. 43</p><p>Running a charter plays out as month-long “charter turns.” Each turn consists of three phases: Upkeep, Projects, and Event. A charter turn plays out at the end of each in-game month after all other adventures and missions have been resolved.</p><p>During this month, one PC must take the week-long downtime activity Perform Administrative Duties (page 45). The PC who takes this activity can change from month to month, and that PC can perform other downtime activities as time allows. Perform Administrative Duties follows the same rules as other downtime activities (Starfinder Character Operations Manual 150). If no PC takes this downtime activity, the charter skips the Resource Collection and Choose Projects steps of the charter turn. A charter without Resource Units (RU) likely gains Unrest and is especially vulnerable to events.</p><p>Other downtime activities can be taken to assist the charter; see Charter Downtime Activities on page 44 for downtime activities related to charters. A character taking a charter downtime activity—including Perform Administrative Duties—must be physically present in the charter while the performing the activity, and these activities are all resolved during the Upkeep phase of the charter turn.</p><h2>Upkeep Phase</h2><p>During the Upkeep phase, you gather resources, pay upkeep, resolve charter downtime activities, and adjust Unrest.</p><h3>Step 1: Resource Collection</h3><p>Determine how many Resource Units you have this turn by rolling your Settlement Die (or Dice, if you have more than one settlement) and any Resource Dice you’ve gained, then including any bonuses or penalties. If you had any unspent Resource Units from last turn, add those to your Resource Units for this turn.</p><h3>Step 2: Charter Downtime Activities</h3><p>PCs who have taken charter downtime activities during the month—such as Perform Administrative Duties—resolve those activities at this time. Doing so might require spending Resource Units; see page 44 for a list of these activities.</p><h3>Step 3: Pay Upkeep</h3><p>Your settlements require supplies and funding, a number of Resource Units equal to your charter’s size; spend this amount of Resource Units now to prevent Unrest. If you can’t—or choose not to—spend these Resource Units, increase Unrest by 1d4.</p><p>Special: Skip this step on the first charter turn.</p><h3>Step 4: Adjust Unrest</h3><p>Your charter begins the first charter turn with an Unrest score of 0. If downtime activities or events have increased or decreased Unrest, make those adjustments now.</p><p>If your charter’s Unrest is 10 or higher after making these adjustments, there’s a 50% chance your charter loses one of the hexes you’ve claimed. The PCs choose which hex is lost. See Using the Map on page 43 for more information.</p><p>If your charter’s Unrest is 20 or higher after making these adjustments, the charter falls into anarchy. While in anarchy, you skip the Choose Projects step and each of your charter trait scores are treated as 1 lower for the purpose of resolving events.</p><h2>Projects Phase</h2><p>During the Projects phase, you decide on your charter’s next projects, which can include expanding your charter’s territory, increasing its production abilities, or constructing an advanced project. Many projects must be assigned to a specific location on your map; these projects have “hex” or “settlement” listed in project requirements. A project with the hex requirement must be assigned to a specific hex that isn’t a settlement. Unless otherwise noted, a hex can contain only one “hex” project. A project with the settlement requirement must be assigned to a specific settlement. A settlement can contain multiple settlement projects, but only one of each specific project. Projects with the requirement of “charter” don’t need to be assigned a location; your charter can benefit from multiple charter project as long as your charter exists, but your charter can have only one of each specific project. Other projects might have other location requirements or special rules.</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Projects</h3><p>Select up to two charter projects, one of which can be an advanced project. Basic projects are detailed on page 46, while advanced projects are listed on pages 46–47. You can choose any projects with listed prerequisites met by your charter. (Note: such prerequisites include Traits and Requirements in the table on pages 46–47.) Then, spend the listed amount of Resource Units. You can’t choose a project for which you don’t have enough Resource Units. Finally, adjust your charter’s trait scores as indicated in each project’s entry, and make any other changes to your charter’s details as indicated.</p><h2>Event Phase</h2><p>In the Event phase, a random event might affect your charter or a single settlement or hex within your charter.</p><h3>Step 1: Check For An Event</h3><p>There’s a 15% chance a charter event occurs each turn. If no event occurred on the previous charter turn, increase the chance for an event this turn by 15%, to a maximum of 90%. Once an event occurs, the percentage chance resets to 15% for the following turn. If an event occurs, roll a d20 and check the Event Table on page 48 to see what event occurs.</p><h3>Step 2: Event Resolution</h3><p>Most events ask you to compare one of your charter’s traits to a Threshold Number. Generally, if your charter doesn’t meet the Threshold Number, it takes a temporary penalty, but if the charter rises to the challenge, it will see a benefit. In some cases, events can present opportunities for the PCs to deal with a situation not covered in these rules. These events are described on pages 48–49.</p>",

Requirements for basic projects are relatively easy, such as exploring or claiming a given hex, but advanced projects require your charter to have one or more minimum charter trait scores, and some projects require your charter to have already completed one or more other projects.</p><h2>Basic Projects</h2><p>The following projects can be performed by most charters.</p><h3>Abandon Hex</h3><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The hex to be abandoned must be controlled by your charter.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> 0 RU</p><p>After careful consideration, you decide that you would rather not hold onto a particular hex as part of your claimed territory. You renounce your claim to it. You can abandon more than 1 hex at a time, but for every 2 hexes you abandon with this project, Unrest increases by 1. Your charter’s size decreases by 1 per hex abandoned, and you gain a +1 bonus to your Resource Collection roll on the next charter turn.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can’t abandon a hex containing a settlement.</p><h3>Build Resource Node</h3><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> A resource node can only be placed in a hex you’ve claimed that doesn’t contain a settlement or project (including another resource node).</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 RU</p><p>Workers establish an industry in the chosen hex; the exact industry depends on the hex’s terrain. Some examples can include: a lumber mill or hunting grounds in forest hexes; a farmland or ranch in plains hexes; a mine or quarry in mountain hexes; and a fishery or hydroelectric dam in aquatic hexes. Regardless, you gain a d4 Resource Die, which you roll with your Settlement Dice during the Resource Phase. If you lose a hex containing a resource node, you lose a Resource Die.</p><h3>Claim Hex</h3><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You’ve reconnoitered the hex you intend to claim, and it contains no active threats. This hex must be adjacent to at least one hex that’s already part of your charter.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 RU</p><p>Your surveyors fully explore the hex and add it to your charter’s domain. Increase your charter’s size by 1.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can claim only 1 hex per Charter Turn unless you build an Elite Reclamation Team (page 46).</p><h3>Establish New Settlement</h3><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The hex where the settlement is to be placed has been claimed by your charter. This hex must be at least 4 hexes away from another settlement.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> 10 RU + 10 RU for every settlement you already have</p><p>Construction workers erect buildings for a new settlement as new residents move in. When gathering resources, roll an additional Settlement Die.</p><h2>Advanced Projects</h2><p>The advanced projects listed in the table on pages 46–47 require a charter to meet certain trait requirements.</p><h3>Reading The Table</h3><p><strong>Traits:</strong> Your charter must have the listed minimum traits before you can undertake the project.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Sometimes finishing a project requires you to have already completed a different project or to place your project in a specific hex. A few requirements are especially common.</p><ul><li><p>Charter: You can only construct this project once for any given charter, and you gain its benefits as long as the charter exists.</p></li><li><p>Hex: You must place this project in a hex you’ve claimed that contains no other project or settlement. If the hex must be a given terrain type, that terrain is listed here.</p></li><li><p>Settlement: You must place this project in one of your settlements; a settlement can contain any number of settlement projects.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cost:</strong> This project costs the listed amount of Resource Units</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Most projects increase one or more traits. A few grant special benefits described in the project’s entry.</p><h3>Advanced Projects Table</h3><table style=\"text-align:center\"><tbody><tr><th><p>Advanced Project</p></th><th><p>Acc</p></th><th><p>Cul</p></th><th><p>Traits Eco</p></th><th><p>Mag</p></th><th><p>Tec</p></th><th><p>Requirements</p></th><th><p>Cost</p></th><th><p>Benefit</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Artificial Intelligence</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Charter</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>28</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Tec</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You develop a true artificial intelligence program.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Armory</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Eco</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You build a place to manufacture, store, and sell weapons and armor.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Augmentation Clinic</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Mag, +1 Tec</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct a facility where augmentations can be purchased and installed.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bank</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>8</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Eco</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct a financial institution.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Broadcast Studio</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>5</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>3</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>15</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Cul, +1 Eco</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You build a studio for creating news and entertainment media.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Courthouse</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>5</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Law enforcement agency, settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>14</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Acc</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You build a place for legal proceedings.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Defenses</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>4</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Acc</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct sturdy walls or automated security measures around a single settlement.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Elite Reclamation Team</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>5</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>7</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>7</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Charter</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>22</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Acc</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>Using advanced survey drones and magical divinations, you can expand your charter faster.

If you’re using the hexploration system (Galaxy Exploration Manual page 35), reduce the number of hexploration activities required to travel in or through the road hex by 1 (to a minimum of 1).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Satellite Launch System</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>6</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>8</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Tec</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct a launch system to put communication and observation satellites in orbit.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>School</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>1</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>8</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Cul, +1 Mag</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct a learning institution for young students.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shopping Center</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>2</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Settlement</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>6</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Acc, + Eco</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You build a marketplace, trading post, or mall.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Solarian Monastery</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>6</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Hex (hill or mountain)</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>14</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Mag</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You build a retreat dedicated to the Cycle and solarian training.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Space Elevator</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>8</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Hex (plains)</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>28</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Tec</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct a massive space elevator linked to the planet’s surface in the chosen hex.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spaceport</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>—</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>8</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>Hex (plains)</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>20</p></td><td style=\"border-left:1px solid\"><p>+1 Eco</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\"><p>You construct landing pads and other facilities for starships.

Some events ask you to compare one or more of your charter’s traits to a Threshold Number (TN). TN is equal to charter size / 5, rounded up. If the indicated trait is under the TN, your charter is adversely affected, but if the result is equal to or higher than the TN, the outcome is positive instead. Other events depend on specific advanced projects your charter might have undertaken. Many events can result in your charter gaining a temporary bonus to one or more traits; this bonus only lasts for the turns indicated and ends after the Event phase. Some events grant rerolls; these rerolls always stack. Some events introduce a recurring problem that plagues the charter; such events don’t affect the chance of future events occurring, and the TN is always calculated based on the charter’s current size, not the size it was when the event was rolled.</p><h3>Celestial Phenomenon</h3><p>An object or event from space— such as a rogue meteor or an especially large solar flare— poses a danger to the charter. If Magic and Technology traits are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4 and lose Resource Units equal to the TN; if only one trait is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1 and lose Resource Units equal to half the TN. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, increase Magic and Technology by 1 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Crime Wave</h3><p>A group of dangerous criminals places a stranglehold on the charter’s citizens, or a lone killer begins a reign of terror. If the charter doesn’t have the law enforcement agency project, increase Unrest by 1 each Upkeep phase until that project has been completed. If the charter already has the law enforcement agency project, increase Accord and Culture by 1 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Cult Activity</h3><p>A mysterious group has laid down roots in the charter’s settlements, leading citizens down a perilous path. If Magic is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1 every Upkeep phase until Magic is equal to or higher than the TN. If Magic is equal to or greater than the TN, increase Magic by 2 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Dangerous Fad</h3><p>A new addictive vidgame, social media app, or other popular phenomenon reduces the charter’s productivity. If Culture and Technology are both less than the TN, reduce Resource Units gained each turn by an amount equal to the TN; this effect lasts 1d6 turns. If only one trait is less than the TN, Resource Units are reduced only during only the next Upkeep phase. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, increase Technology by 2 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Diplomatic Incident</h3><p>An unfortunate error causes tension between the charter and another political entity. If Culture and Magic are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d8, and your charter can’t choose the trade deal project for 1d4 charter turns; if only one trait is less than the TN, you can’t choose the trade deal project for the next charter turn. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, the charter gets an apology and gifts from the other political entity; your charter gains Resource Units equal to your Accord.</p><h3>Economic Depression</h3><p>Due to poor investments or a downturn in the galactic market, the charter is on the verge of economic troubles. If Economy is less than the TN, reduce Resource Units gained each turn by an amount equal to the TN; this effect lasts 1d8 turns. If Economy is equal to or greater than the TN, you can reroll one Settlement die next turn.</p><h3>Espionage</h3><p>A spy within the charter leaks your secrets to a rival. If your charter’s Accord is less than the TN, reduce one of the charter’s traits (chosen randomly from Culture, Economy, Magic, and Technology) by 3 for the next 1d4 Charter turns. If the charter’s Accord is equal to or greater than the TN, increase one of the charter’s traits (chosen randomly from Culture, Economy, Magic, and Technology) by 2 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Local Disaster</h3><p>A building fire, terrible vehicle accident, or other small-scale disaster affects the citizens of one of the charter’s settlements. If Accord and Technology are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d10; if only one trait is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4 instead. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Mass Exodus</h3><p>Many of the charter’s citizens depart for other opportunities, possibly lured away by a political entity on the same planet. If Accord and Culture are both less than the TN, reduce Resource Units gained each turn by an amount equal to the TN; this effect lasts 1d8 turns. If only one trait is less than the TN, the Resource Unit reduction is only half the TN. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Mystical Plague</h3><p>A magic disease or curse infects the charter’s citizens. If half or more of the charter’s settlements have the hospital project and the charter’s Magic trait is equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4. If these two conditions aren’t met, increase Unrest by 1 every Upkeep phase until both conditions are met.</p><h3>Natural Calamity</h3><p>A flood, earthquake, or other natural disaster strikes a large portion of the charter. If Technology is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d8. If Technology is equal to or greater than the TN, decrease Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Political Corruption</h3><p>One or more officials in the charter’s government are suspected of corrupt activities. If Culture and Economy are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d8; if only one trait is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4 instead. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Pollution Problem</h3><p>The waste produced by the charter’s industries threaten to get out of control. If the charter doesn’t have the waste disposal project, increase Unrest by 1 every Upkeep phase until that project has been completed. If the charter already has the waste disposal project, increase Economy by 2 for the next charter turn.</p><h3>Population Surge</h3><p>An influx of immigrants eager to become citizens arrives on the planet. If Accord and Economy are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, increase Culture and Economy by 1 for the next charter turn.</p><p>Public Scandal: An important figure in the charter is the center of terrible rumors about their personal life. If Accord and Magic are both less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d8; if only one trait is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4 instead. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Resource Scarcity</h3><p>A particular resource the charter relies on becomes difficult to acquire. If fewer than half of the charter’s resource nodes haven’t been upgraded to upgraded resource nodes, increase the cost of all advanced projects by an amount equal to the number of non-upgraded resource nodes; this effect lasts for 1d6 turns. If half or more of the charter’s resources nodes have already been upgraded, you can reroll one Settlement die next turn.</p><h3>Scientific Breakthrough</h3><p>Researchers make an important discovery, but now the charter must capitalize on it. If the charter has completed a Research Institute project, you can reroll one Settlement die next turn. Otherwise, reduce Economy and Technology by 2 for the next 1d4 turns.</p><h3>Strange Weather</h3><p>Unusual weather conditions—such as unseasonal snowstorms, increased ball lightning activity, or winds that causes psychic headaches—run through the charter. If Economy and Magic are both less than the TN, reduce Resource Units gained each turn by the TN; this effect lasts 1d8 turns. If only one trait is less than the TN, the Resource Unit reduction is only half the TN. If both traits are equal to or greater than the TN, reduce Unrest by 1d4.</p><h3>Visiting Celebrity</h3><p>A famous individual or group visits your charter. If Culture is less than the TN, increase Unrest by 1d4. If Culture is equal to or greater than the TN, the celebrity offers the charter a boon; gain Resource Units equal to Culture.</p><h3>Wildlife Attack</h3><p>Beasts from a nearby wilderness—perhaps displaced by encroaching civilization—attack one of the charter’s settlements. Choose a settlement at random. If that settlement doesn’t have the defenses project, increase Unrest by 1d6+1. If the settlement does have the defenses project, increase Accord by 2 for the next charter turn.</p>",
