On its billions of worlds, physics create every possible permutation of geology, while lifeâ€™s endless creativity gives rise to organisms both eerily familiar and defying imagination. Regardless of their design, all of these creatures struggle to survive and thrive in their native habitats, from icy seas and lush fungus jungles to the savage pyroclastic flows of tidally heated moons or the rusting hulks of ancient alien megastructures. The following section contains rules to help you as GM adjudicate the game universe, including rules for the vastness of space, for various types of planets and the different terrains that may be found on them, and for environmental effects and hazards that may come into play in a variety of settings. Rules for settlements and structures both natural and artificial are presented at the end of the chapter.</span></p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.9x8PApRh6UoP466l]{Space}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.pzOC4ojLo7Y5U9MV]{Astronomical Objects}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.z2JnsaHKE5QvwVSQ]{Atmospheres}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.gQK9KdezsjzD4d3V]{Environmental Rules}</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.TN4VeY75Z2Ce8IT7]{Settlements}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.CPkDG7SXnJ0ky8px]{Structures}</span></p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wq0rxkhUb86A182m]{Materials}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.zDW0cDPQL55G7ose]{Breaking Objects}</p>",
