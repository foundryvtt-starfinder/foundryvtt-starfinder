        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> COM pg. 150</p><p>Not even the most battle-scarred and seasoned mercenary spends every day in combat. Most adventurers have a few days or weeks between jobs, and even if their schedule is packed, interplanetary travel and journeys through the Drift require time—time that can’t be spent fighting foes or exploring. The rules here detail what adventurers might be doing in the quiet times, between the excitement of exploration and the terror of combat.</p><p>Downtime is measured in days of 24 consecutive hours of Pact Standard Time. During a day in which you don’t do any adventuring, engage in starship combat, use overland movement, or take part in other time-consuming or demanding activities, you can engage in one of the downtime activities described in this section (you can still engage in a single 8-hour rest). If you begin a downtime activity at the start of a day but that activity is interrupted during the day—for instance, if starship combat breaks out—that downtime activity provides no benefit, and you must start over on a new day. A notable exception to this is the maintain readiness activity (page 153), which provides a benefit when interrupted.</p><p>Most of the activities listed in this section include entries for Activity, Results, and Multiday, detailed below. Several downtime activities refer to or expand upon options in the Starfinder Core Rulebook; page references are included for convenience.</p><p><strong>Activity:</strong> The downtime activity is described here, as well as all requirements for it, including skill checks, saving throws, equipment, starship expansion bays, and similar facilities. You can take 10 or take 20 on skill checks for downtime activities unless otherwise stated (in either these rules or those referenced in the Core Rulebook).</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The results of a downtime activity are resolved at the end of the day unless stated otherwise, and many downtime activities grant benefits for the following day. If there are penalties for failure, those are also listed here.</p><p><strong>Multiday:</strong> If you can perform an activity for a longer period of time to gain a different or improved benefit, that’s listed here. Unless otherwise stated, this time period must be consecutive; if you are interrupted at any point during that interval (such as by a random encounter in the Drift) or if you choose a different downtime activity, you lose any progress made. If you choose to restart the activity, you must start over.</p><h2>Common Downtime Activities</h2><p>While there are dozens of options for spending downtime, many adventurers stick to a few favorite options; several of the most common are bolded in the following examples.</p><p>On a weeklong journey through the Drift, a given starship’s overcautious pilot might choose each day whether to maintain readiness (page 153) or manage course (page 154), a diligent engineer might maintain equipment (page 153), and the captain might take several days to coordinate (page 151) with their crew before using the rest to lounge (page 153).</p><p>Meanwhile, a war-weary, resource-starved party on a hostile alien world might take several days to convalesce (page 151), while their best medic endeavors to provide long-term care (page 155) in hopes of speeding their recovery.</p>",

You must be in a starship orbiting a world to use this activity. Choose one or more of the following elements: the world’s sapient species, threat species, level of technology, level of magic, level of religion, level of accord, general alignment, large settlements, or a single planetary anomaly. The number of elements that can be analyzed in 1 day, per starship, depends on the number of nodes the starship’s computer has (1 with a basic computer or mononode, 2 with a duonode, and so on).</p><p>GMs can use the guidance in the Building Worlds section of this book (pages 46–47) to generate results for both the basic elements of a world and most of those listed above. The GM may determine that some aspects of a planet’s physical or cultural attributes are not discernible from orbit. For GM advice on planetary anomalies, see the sidebar below.</p><p>At the end of the day, attempt a separate skill check for each element you’re trying to learn more about. The type of skill check depends on the chosen element: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.LeZmnFwnlB89ovBB]{Culture} for alignment or level of accord, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.76u4HnGcAlySicb4]{Engineering} for level of technology, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.tVUA3IPcOfyU1g19]{Life Science} for sapient or threat species, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism} for level of magic or religion, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.w7NNLCayniMsh3ne]{Physical Science} for large settlements. The type of skill check used for planetary anomalies varies by anomaly and is determined by the GM. Regardless of the skill used, the DC begins at 25 and is modified as normal (see the Sensor Modifiers sidebar). You can’t take 20 on this check.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> On each successful check, you learn basic information about the chosen element, such as the most populous threat species or the world’s relative level of magic. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you might also glean more detailed information at the GM’s discretion.</p><h3>Sensor Modifiers</h3><p>Various circumstances might modify the DC for the checks needed to ascertain information about a planet while using sensors in orbit. The following is a list of some of those circumstances and how they modify the DC. Modifiers from two or more different sources can stack (such as if a planet has both a thick atmosphere and an extreme magnetic field). Strange anomalies may hamper scanning at the GM’s discretion; see the Planetary Anomalies sidebar below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>CIRCUMSTANCE</strong></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><strong>DC MODIFIER</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Anomaly</td><td>-2 to +4</td></tr><tr><td>Energetic magnetic field</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme magnetic field</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Planetary sensor scrambler</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Thick atmosphere</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Thin atmosphere</td><td>-2</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Planetary Anomalies</h3><p>Anything that makes a world unique beyond its basic physical and cultural characteristics can be considered a planetary anomaly. This could manifest as a strong connection to a different plane of existence, a global magic- or technology-dampening field, an abundance of mystical crystalline caverns just below the surface, especially active plate tectonics, or a singularity barely contained within the planet’s core. Each biome section (pages 48–95) and most cultural attributes (96–129) contain tables of adventure hooks, which can be a great source of inspiration for planetary (or more localized) anomalies. Feel free to adapt ideas from your favorite books, films, and other media, and remember that the only limit in a science fantasy setting is your imagination.</p>",

You must be within a settlement, though the GM might allow you to find cargo in other locations. At the end of the day, attempt a Diplomacy or Profession (merchant) check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your character level). You take a cumulative –1 penalty to this roll for every find cargo activity you or your allies have previously attempted in this settlement within the last week.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> On a success, you find [[/r 1d4]]{1d4 lots of cargo} available for sale. The cargo can’t be split up; all of the lots must be bought together. The cargo’s total buy price equals [[/r 1d4]]{1d4 BP × the number of lots}. For every 5 by which your check exceeds the result, you can adjust the size of the cargo by 1 lot in either direction.</p><p>The GM determines the type of cargo and might even tell you where you can sell it for a reasonable price. All of the cargo must be transported and sold together, and you and your allies must load the cargo onto your starship yourselves. Some cargoes must be delivered within a certain time frame. When you are told the type of cargo, its buy price, and its destination and its sell price (if applicable), you can choose not to purchase that cargo. However, when you purchase the cargo, it’s yours to decide what to do with—though you might want to perform the find buyer downtime activity (page 169) at another settlement to sell it.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> If multiple allies perform this downtime activity during the same day, only one of them attempts the check, but with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus for each aiding ally (not including the one attempting the check).</p>",
