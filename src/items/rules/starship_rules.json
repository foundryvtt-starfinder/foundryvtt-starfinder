        "content": "<p>No one knows which Pact World first achieved spaceflight, but by the beginning of the modern era, nearly every world had some form of interplanetary travel. For some, this was purely magical: powerful spells or artifacts, or quick jaunts through other planes of existence allowed travelers access to their intended world. Yet for others, the airless void of space was just another sea to be crossed, which they did in a variety of craft, from magical to mechanical and from biological to divine.</p><p>A s technology improved, travel time between worlds dropped from months and years to days, and the optimal routes between planets became crowded with spacecraft. Yet even in this new age of space flight, voyages beyond the solar system remained rare; traveling to even the nearest star at conventional speeds would take generations. While a few starships had drives capable of circumventing this obstacle, all relied on extremely expensive magical technology, often controlled by churches or other organizations. From Asmodean Helldrives to Kuthite shadow engines to the prayer-fueled cores of Iomedaean cathedralships, most of these technologies not only took the ship through other planes but also operated with direct divine assistance, and thus always came with a hefty price. While other drives had been theorized—drives that could fold space, create stable wormholes, or otherwise bend the rules of physics—the Pact Worlds had never managed to build them.</p><p>Then, 3 years after the end of the Gap, the Signal went out. Some worlds received it as a broadcast. It came to others in the dreams of inventors or lunatics, or etched into floors by malfunctioning assembly robots. Still others dug it from the innards of crashed space probes, found it carved on monoliths in city centers, or heard it blared from the sky by entities within wheels of flame. Regardless of the mechanism, at the same instant, thousands of cultures across the Material Plane received the same information: blueprints for a new type of starship drive—one capable of cheaply and efficiently shortening the distance between stars. </p><p>Though some scholars argue that every mortal culture received this information, many recipients were never aware of it or able to capitalize on it. In some cases, cultures weren’t technologically advanced enough to interpret the information—explorers have even uncovered these designs painted on cave walls by an uncomprehending paleolithic culture. In other cases, the information was lost due to simple accident, as when an inventor blessed with the information fell out a window before he could share it.</p><p>Immediately following the Signal, the new god Triune (see page 490) revealed itself to the Pact Worlds, claiming to have granted the knowledge as a blessing to its new mortal children. Formerly three minor gods of machines and robotics, now networked together into a single entity, the divine collective claimed to have peered through the substrata of reality and discovered a previously unknown plane of existence. Called the Drift, this plane could be reached only via technology—not magic—and would allow mortals to cheaply and easily travel between points anywhere in the galaxy. In granting this discovery to the world, Triune became one of the most powerful entities in the multiverse overnight: the new god of interstellar travel.</p><p>Like earlier interstellar drives, Drift engines operate by jumping to another plane of existence and then back to a different point on the Material Plane, thus never actually running up against the hard limit presented by the speed of light. In the past, that had meant using powerful magic and traveling to places like Heaven, Hell, the Maelstrom, or the First World—places inhabited by creatures and gods with sometimes inconvenient attitudes and appetites. The Drift, on the other hand, is a different type of dimension: a void of swirling color without substance, a mostly empty place of mutable laws, thought by some to be the quantum foam underlying all creation. While magic still functions inside the Drift, only technology can pierce the membrane between it and the rest of reality, which, combined with Triune’s role as gatekeeper, keeps any other deities or organizations from monopolizing the place.</p><p>While even most skeptics and members of other religions are forced to admit that Triune has appeared to make good on its egalitarian offer to maintain cheap and easy interstellar travel for everyone, use of the Drift does come with a catch. Every time a Drift engine is used, a tiny portion of a random plane is torn from its home and added to the Drift, set to float there for eternity. The farther the jump, the larger the chunk of material, which sometimes appears near the jumping ship, adding an element of risk: you never know when a long jump might tear away a chunk of Hell and leave you flying through a cloud of furious devils. Even those making safely measured jumps might encounter strange beasts trapped there by previous travels. Why the technology involves this side effect is unknown, though some conspiracy theorists believe that the ever-increasing size of the Drift—and the corresponding shrinking of the other planes of existence—is part of an inscrutable power play by Triune itself.</p><h2>STANDARD NAVIGATION AND ASTROGATION</h2><p>Whether they’re patrol craft or battlecruisers, all starships are propelled through space by thrusters. The exact workings of these engines vary from starship to starship—some are technological, while others are a blend of magic and machine. See the navigate task of the Piloting skill (page 145) for information about using that skill to plot a correct course.</p><p>Determine the approximate distance you wish to travel and roll using the travel times below to see how long it takes you to reach your destination, but note that the Game Master is the final arbiter of travel times and may shorten or lengthen them as she desires for the needs of the campaign.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Start Thrusters (1 Minute per Size Category):</strong> Though this is rarely an issue, a starship’s thrusters need a short amount of time to warm up before they are ready to be used. Most hangars and space docks require that a starship’s thrusters be deactivated after it lands or docks. However, a starship in orbit always has its thrusters active. A starship also needs to deactivate its thrusters, which takes no time, to use its Drift engine (see below).</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Point-to-Point on a Planet (1d4 Hours)</strong>: Large and smaller starships can operate in a planet or planetoid’s atmosphere, and can travel between two areas on the same planet within reason (a starship isn’t generally equipped to be submerged underwater, for instance). The travel time depends on the distance between the two points. This amount of time can also be used to represent traveling between two vessels in different orbits around the same planet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go into Orbit or Land (1d2 Hours)</strong>: It takes only a short amount of time for a Large or smaller starship to lift off from a planet’s or planetoid’s surface and enter orbit, or to make a controlled landing from orbit. Huge and larger starships can be placed in orbit around only a planet or planetoid, and the crew requires a shuttle or other conveyance to reach the surface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reach Satellite (1d8 Hours)</strong>: From planetary orbit, it takes slightly longer for a starship to reach one of that planet’s satellite bodies (or vice versa) than it would take to land. This travel time depends partly on the size of the planet and the satellite’s orbit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel In-System (1d6+2 Days)</strong>: Traveling between two planets in the same star system fluctuates based on those planets’ relative positions at the time of travel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Between Systems</strong>: Traveling between two star systems via conventional thrusters is a daunting affair, taking decades at the very least. Only large colony starships or vessels with crews in suspended animation attempt such a journey.</p></li></ul><h2>DRIFT NAVIGATION</h2><p>Using Drift technology differs from ordinary astrogation in that the distances between worlds are less important than the difficulty of correctly targeting the jump. Within a given solar system, jumps are relatively quick and easy, though this method is only moderately faster than flying between worlds using conventional thrusters. Outside of a given system, Drift tech divides the galaxy into two sectors: Near Space and the Vast. While Near Space worlds tend to be closer to the galactic center (and, incidentally, to the Pact Worlds) and the systems of the Vast tend to be farther out, the true difference between the regions lies in the density of so-called “Drift beacons.” These mysterious objects, sometimes spontaneously generated and sometimes placed by priests of Triune, help navigation systems orient ships in the Drift. While placing a single Drift beacon on a world isn’t enough to convert a Vast world to Near Space status, placing many in that general region of space can cause the shift, and thus it’s possible to find pockets of Near Space worlds all the way out to the galactic rim, as well as uncharted zones considered part of the Vast near the galaxy’s core.</p><p>When traveling to a world through the Drift, determine whether the destination is in the same system, Near Space, or the Vast. The distance between the start and end of your journey doesn’t matter, nor which category of space you’re starting from: traveling from the Vast to a Near Space world is no more difficult than between two Near Space worlds. Roll using the travel times below, then divide the result by your starship’s Drift engine rating to determine how long it takes you to reach your destination. For example, a starship with a Drift engine rating of 2 traveling to a world in the Vast would roll 5d6 and divide the result by 2. If you rolled 15, then the trip would take 7-1/2 days. Note that you never round down with Drift travel rolls, since these partial days can be extremely important when multiple spacecraft are racing each other to a destination. Additionally, since the Drift is a plane that you’re traveling through, it is possible to pause midjump, and even to land on one of the floating chunks of terrain or engage in starship combat. Time spent stopped in this manner does not bring you closer to your destination, and thus does not count toward your required travel time. Days spent in the Drift are no different for the crew than days spent in normal space, and thus  they can craft items, heal, and take other actions as normal.</p><p>The one exception to the rules above is Absalom Station: for unknown reasons, the Starstone at its core acts as an extremely powerful Drift beacon, allowing ships from anywhere in the galaxy to jump to Absalom Station in 1d6 days.</p><p>While traveling through the Drift, a starship uses its conventional thrusters. For a starship to engage its Drift engines to either enter or exit the Drift, its conventional thrusters must be turned off for 1 minute.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Travel In-System (1d6 Days)</strong>: Jumping between two points in the same solar system is moderately faster than moving between them in real space, and is so short as to carry only a 1% chance of random encounters in the Drift.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel to Absalom Station (1d6 Days)</strong>: Jumping to Absalom Station always takes only 1d6 days, thanks to the Starstone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel to Near Space (3d6 Days)</strong>: Near Space contains the Pact Worlds system and most of the worlds colonized and contacted so far by their explorers, but there are still thousands of Near Space worlds yet to be investigated. Jumps to Near Space worlds rarely carry more than a 10% chance of a random encounter while in the Drift.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel to the Vast (5d6 Days)</strong>: Largely unexplored, the millions of Vast worlds are significantly more difficult to get to than Near Space, and the risk of a random encounter in the Drift can be anywhere from 25% to as high as 50%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel beyond the Rim</strong>: While other galaxies are known to exist, the distances between them and the galaxy of the Pact Worlds are so incredibly large that there have yet to be any confirmed instances of intergalactic travel using Drift technology. Whether this is due to the extreme travel times involved, limits to the reach of the Drift itself, or dangers encountered in the Drift during such attempts remains unknown.</p></li></ul><p></p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source</strong>: CRB, pp. 292-305</p><p>From the smallest transport shuttles to the largest, battle-ready dreadnoughts, starships are an important part of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. They defend orbital stations from raids by space pirates, engage enemy fleets during massive interstellar conflicts, and explore the deepest reaches of space. But at their simplest, they allow the characters to travel the stars in search of adventure. The following chapter outlines the process of building a starship from scratch and customizing it to perfectly fit your needs.</p><h2>UNDERSTANDING STARSHIPS</h2><p>Starships and their base frames are described using stat blocks that include information about how they move, the size of their crews, and more. When you’re reading a starship or base frame stat block, the statistics and definitions below define its capabilities. A starship sheet is provided at the end of this book.</p><h3>Name and Tier:</h3><p>This is the designation of the starship and its power level. Starships of different tiers vary to a greater degree in terms of power and abilities than monsters whose Challenge Rating (CR) differs by a similar amount.</p><h3>Size Category and Frame:</h3><p>This describes the overall size of the vessel (see Starship Scale on page 294). A starship’s size provides a modifier to its Armor Class and Target Lock (see below). This entry also notes the base frame of the starship (see page 294).</p><h3>Speed:</h3><p>This is the number of hexes the starship can move using most pilot actions.</p><h3>Maneuverability:</h3><p>A starship’s maneuverability is rated clumsy, poor, average, good, or perfect. This is generally tied to the mass and size of the starship, and it both indicates how agile the starship is in space and determines the minimum number of hexes the starship must move before it can turn (see page 319).</p><h3>Drift:</h3><p>This is a starship’s Drift engine rating. When determining how long it takes a starship to travel to a location through the Drift, divide the die roll by this number (see page 291). If this entry is absent, the starship can’t travel into the Drift.</p><h3>Armor Class (AC):</h3><p>This value is used when determining whether direct-fire weapons (see Type on page 303) hit a starship. AC is calculated based on the ship’s size, maneuverability, and physical armor, as well as the pilot’s number of ranks in the Piloting skill. See page 320 for details on calculating AC.</p><h3>Target Lock (TL):</h3><p>This value is used when determining whether tracking weapons (see Type on page 303) hit a starship. TL is calculated based on the starship’s size, defensive countermeasures (see page 298), and armor, plus the pilot’s number of ranks in the Piloting skill. See page 320 for details.</p><h3>Hull Points (HP):</h3><p>This is the total amount of damage a starship can take before it becomes inoperative. A starship with 0 Hull Points isn’t destroyed, though many of its systems are no longer functioning and it is no longer a threat to its enemies. In a base frame stat block, the Hull Points entry also lists the HP increment, which is the number of Hull Points a starship with that frame automatically gains when its tier increases to 4 (and every 4 tiers thereafter; see page 294).</p><h3>Damage Threshold (DT):</h3><p>If an attack deals less damage than this value, that damage isn’t counted against the ship’s total Hull Points. Only Huge or larger ships have a Damage Threshold, and it matters only when such a starship’s shields are depleted (see page 320).</p><h3>Critical Threshold (CT):</h3><p>Whenever the total amount of damage that has been dealt to a starship’s Hull Points reaches a multiple of this value, one of its systems takes critical damage (see page 321). This value is always one-fifth of the starship’s maximum number of Hull Points.</p><h3>Shields:</h3><p>In a starship stat block, this lists the ship’s shield system and the Shield Points (SP), which represent the damage shields can take before they’re depleted. Shield Points are assigned to particular quadrants (forward, port, starboard, or aft). These quadrants correspond in orientation to the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.iuRklGcMf04Q8CjD#firing-arcs]{firing arcs} shown in the diagram on page 318.</p><h3>Attacks:</h3><p>A starship has four @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.iuRklGcMf04Q8CjD#firing-arcs]{firing arcs}: forward, port, starboard, and aft (see the diagram on page 318). Most nonturret weapons can fire only in the firing arc where they’re mounted; turret weapons can be fired in any arc. The attack entries list the various weapons mounted on the ship that can fire in each of the arcs. Each weapon also lists its damage, range, and other special properties.</p><h3>Mounts:</h3><p>In a base frame stat block, this entry lists the class of weapon that can be mounted on the starship (see page 303).</p><h3>Power Core:</h3><p>This lists a starship’s power core or cores (see page 296) and the power core units (PCU) it produces.</p><h3>Drift Engine:</h3><p>The starship’s Drift engine, if any, is listed here.</p><h3>Systems:</h3><p>This entry lists a starship’s major systems, such as armor, defensive countermeasures, sensors, and weapons (see page 297).</p><h3>Expansion Bays:</h3><p>This entry lists any expansion bays—cargo spaces that can be used for special purposes (see page 298).</p><h3>Modifiers:</h3><p>This entry lists the bonuses (or penalties) to certain skill checks during starship combat gained from a starship’s speed and maneuverability, as well as from some starship systems.</p><h3>Minimum and Maximum Crew:</h3><p>In a base frame stat block, these entries note the minimum and maximum number of characters who can take actions on that vessel during starship combat. Larger starships use teams that report to a higher officer who performs an assigned role in starship combat (see Large and Small Crews on page 316 for more about large crews). A starship without its minimum crew can’t be operated.</p><h3>Complement:</h3><p>In a starship stat block, this section lists the total size of the crew aboard that ship.</p><h3>Crew:</h3><p>In a starship stat block, this section lists those filling various roles in combat (see page 316), as well as their bonuses to skills used during starship combat and number of ranks in those skills—see page 316 for more on determining these. Any modifiers listed earlier in the stat block are accounted for here. If a starship has teams supporting officers who fill roles, this entry also lists the number and size of teams. This section is listed only for ships under the GM’s control—PCs can perform their own actions aboard starships they control; for more on these actions, see Starship Combat on page 316.</p><h3>Special Abilities:</h3><p>Any unique actions or qualities a starship has due to its crew or its equipment are listed here.</p><h3>Cost:</h3><p>In a base frame stat block, this lists the frame’s Build Point cost. Build Points (BP) are an abstract resource used for creating and upgrading starships.</p><p></p><h2>SHOOTING STARSHIPS</h2><p>Starship weapons and regular PC-level weapons work on different scales and aren’t meant to interact with each other. If characters choose to shoot at a starship with their laser rifles (or cast a spell on it) while it is on the ground, the GM should treat the starship as an object (a particularly massive one, at that). At the GM’s discretion, if starship weapons are ever brought to bear against buildings or people, they deal Hit Point damage equal to 10 × their listed amount of damage. However, starship weapons are never precise enough to target a single individual (or even small group) and can, if the GM decides, be simulated as deadly hazards instead of weapon attacks.</p>",

GMs and players alike can use the following steps to create an incredibly diverse array of vessels, from sleek science ships and nimble skirmishers to heavily armored combat frigates. Alternatively, you can use the prebuilt sample starships detailed later in this chapter (see page 305).</p><p>While it’s possible to run a Starfinder game that doesn’t involve starships at all, the Starfinder RPG assumes that PCs have access to a starship. Whether it was built from scrap, received from a generous benefactor, or purchased with an exorbitant loan, the PCs’ starship serves as a mobile base of operations, a means of reaching distant stars, and a defense against hostile alien vessels. Often, the PCs’ first starship is designed by the GM and can be upgraded or even replaced as the characters gain experience. However, some GMs might allow the PCs free reign over their starship’s creation, letting them feel a sense of true ownership over the starship that will accompany them throughout the campaign. Either way, a starship’s power level is based on the PCs’ Average Party Level (APL)—the characters’ average character level. See @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#refitting-and-upgrading-starships]{Refitting and Upgrading Starships} on page 305 for information on how to adjust a starship’s capabilities when the characters’ APL changes.</p><h2>STARSHIP SCALE</h2><p>Though the size categories of starships have the same names as the size categories of creatures, they operate on completely different scales. Even within a size category, a starship’s exact measurements might differ between base frames and manufacturers. The size of a starship also modifies its Armor Class and Target Lock as indicated.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>SIZE</p></td><td><p>LENGTH</p></td><td><p>WEIGHT</p></td><td><p>AC AND TL MODIFIER</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tiny</p></td><td><p>20–60 ft.</p></td><td><p>2–40 tons</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Small</p></td><td><p>60–120 ft.</p></td><td><p>30–250 tons</p></td><td><p>+1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>120–300 ft.</p></td><td><p>50–2,500 tons</p></td><td><p>+0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Large</p></td><td><p>300–800 ft.</p></td><td><p>2,000–50,000 tons</p></td><td><p>–1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Huge</p></td><td><p>800–2,000 ft.</p></td><td><p>40,000–640,000 tons</p></td><td><p>–2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gargantuan</p></td><td><p>2,000–15,000 ft.</p></td><td><p>600,000 tons to 250 megatons</p></td><td><p>–4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Colossal</p></td><td><p>Over 15,000 ft.</p></td><td><p>200–2,000 megatons</p></td><td><p>–8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Supercolossal</p></td><td><p>Over 6 miles</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>–8</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>When creating a starship, follow these steps.</p><ul><li><p>Step 1: <strong>Conceptualize</strong>. Start by deciding what type of starship you are designing, with a general idea of its purpose and required crew size. If you are creating a starship to be used by PCs, make sure that all the PCs can fit within the vessel! Some of the choices you make later might depend on your overall concept.</p></li><li><p>Step 2: <strong>Determine tier and Build Points</strong>. If you are creating a PC starship, determine the characters’ APL by adding together the characters’ levels and dividing by the number of characters. That number is their ship’s tier. If designing enemy starships, decide the difficulty of the encounter (see Designing Starship Encounters on page 326) and choose the enemy ship’s tier. Once you know the tier of the ship, consult Table 9–1: Starship Base Statistics to determine the number of Build Points you can spend to create the starship. Note that a starship receives a boost to its Hull Points equal to its HP increment at tiers 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.</p><p><strong>TABLE 9–1: STARSHIP BASE STATISTICS</strong></p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>TIER</p></td><td><p>STARSHIP BUILD POINTS</p></td><td><p>SPECIAL</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/4</p></td><td><p>25</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/3</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/2</p></td><td><p>40</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>55</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>75</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>95</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>115</p></td><td><p>HP increase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>135</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>155</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>180</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>205</p></td><td><p>HP increase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>230</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>270</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>310</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>350</p></td><td><p>HP increase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>400</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>450</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>500</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>600</p></td><td><p>HP increase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>700</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>800</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>900</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>1,000</p></td><td><p>HP increase</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></li><li><p>Step 3: <strong>Select a frame</strong>. Each starship is built upon one of a variety of frames that determines its size, maneuverability, crew complement, weapon mounts, and other basic statistics. Each frame costs a certain number of Build Points; see @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#base-frame]{Base Frame} below for more information.</p></li><li><p>Step 4: <strong>Select a power core</strong>. A starship’s power core determines its overall power available (listed in power core units, or PCU), so you should spend Build Points on it first (see page 296). This amount of power can be used as a kind of budget when installing other systems, such as thrusters and weapons—see @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#power-budget]{Power Budget} on page 296 for more suggestions.</p></li><li><p>Step 5: <strong>Select thrusters</strong>. A starship without a means of propulsion is nothing more than a floating target (or an inert hunk of metal on a planet’s surface), so spending Build Points on the starship’s thrusters should be your next priority. On page 296, @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#thrusters]{thrusters} are listed by starship size and speed (in hexes) during combat.</p></li><li><p>Step 6: <strong>Select other systems</strong>. Next, spend your remaining Build Points on all the other systems you wish to have on your starship. To be effective in combat, a starship needs @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#armor]{armor}, @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#defensive-countermeasures]{defensive countermeasures}, @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#shields]{shields}, and @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#weapons]{weapons}. If you wish to travel to locations outside of your home star system, it also needs a @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#drift-engines]{Drift engine}. Other, more optional purchases include upgrades to the starship’s @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#computer]{computers}, @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#expansion-bays]{expansion bays}, @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#security]{security}, and @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#sensors]{sensors}. (See @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#other-systems]{Other Systems} on page 297.)</p></li><li><p>Step 7: <strong>Add details</strong>. Finally, once all these choices have been made, you should give your starship a name, determine its relevant statistics (such as its AC and TL), and add any other details (such as quirks, physical description, and so on).</p></li></ul><h2>BASE FRAME</h2><p>Each starship has a base frame that determines its size, maneuverability, starting weapon mounts, hull strength, room for expansion, and other capacities. Although two ships that use the same frame might look radically different, they both have some of these base statistics in common. The frame of a starship includes all life support and artificial gravity systems necessary to keep the crew (and any passengers) alive and comfortable. The starship’s frame is also built with a transponder that is essentially the ship’s “address” for standard system-wide and unlimited-range communications (see page 430); this transponder can be turned off, during which time the starship can’t send or receive messages, but neither can it be tracked down by conventional means.</p><p>The base frames below are organized by size (from smallest to largest) and cost in Build Points (with less expensive frames coming first within a size). In general, the size and expansion bay capacities of a base frame can’t be changed without a great deal of time and money (and the GM’s permission), so it can be more effective to just start over with a different base frame when upgrading those aspects of a starship.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.kQolIpBtaO6yfIKq]{Racer}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.SuBFu43Yd6m9bxVj]{Interceptor}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.j9cPFzEOxnflqoVP]{Fighter}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.NhP9wzDRdCzrprZN]{Shuttle}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ck0QQw1vY8938PMZ]{Light Freighter}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.2S9DUbojxLZFDP2G]{Explorer}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.hMSu9GvYuD6jacCw]{Transport}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.RZdqZZQLsqc0Sax1]{Destroyer}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.cnIheFqlpkwmzRVp]{Heavy Freighter}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.6nqOn4QKr3W8T3Tx]{Bulk Freighter}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.RprimxGkKcjoFZE4]{Cruiser}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.jARAlB1Y3pWsEt1A]{Carrier}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.3whk642fnwjuwXGJ]{Battleship}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.eF36xrYtexToaxzE]{Dreadnought}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.lGwXmnOTcry4D1n8]{Base Ship} - <strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 36</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.uLe5x7q0eWEHoxZ8]{Ultranought} - <strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 36</p><p></p><h2>POWER CORE</h2><p>The power core is the most important system on a ship, as it provides power to every other system. The table below lists the ship size each core is designed for, as well as the PCU it provides and its cost. Each Large and smaller ship has room for only a single power core by default, but Medium and Large starships can be fitted with an extra power core housing (see @UUID[.prwFRuwtGYNChHlr#expansion-bays:]{Expansion Bays} on page 298). Huge starships can have up to two power cores, Gargantuan starships can have up to three, and Colossal starships can have up to four. Though some ships are exceptions to this standard, they are rare in design. A power core typically has a backup battery system for use in emergencies that can provide limited power—enough for life support, gravity, and comms (see page 430), but no other systems—for 2d6 days.</p><p>Supercolossal ships require massive power. A Supercolossal ship can mount one of the Supercolossal power cores shown in the following table. If a Supercolossal starship has a Supercolossal power core, the vessel can also have up to four backup cores; those cores must be designed for Huge or Gargantuan starships. If a Supercolossal starship doesn’t have a Supercolossal power core, the vessel can instead mount up to five power cores designed for Colossal ships.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>CORE</p></td><td><p>SIZE</p></td><td><p>PCU</p></td><td><p>COST (IN BP)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.C1FoWEdrC0sFFjy2]{Micron Light}</p></td><td><p>T</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.Cj3GeDQsrhKPoqK9]{Micron Heavy}</p></td><td><p>T</p></td><td><p>70</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.GR3tRKvzY3a1CcIr]{Micron Ultra}</p></td><td><p>T</p></td><td><p>80</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.0c0d4OM0CXTV4d6Q]{Arcus Light}</p></td><td><p>T, S</p></td><td><p>75</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.BtuC9EBIAVixAMfc]{Pulse Brown}</p></td><td><p>T, S</p></td><td><p>90</p></td><td><p>9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.h0ibSBhcNKG6JefB]{Pulse Black}</p></td><td><p>T, S</p></td><td><p>120</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.eqMXGl4BoPxn1Lvt]{Pulse White}</p></td><td><p>T, S</p></td><td><p>140</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.HPvTFeObaCO2QXaf]{Pulse Gray}</p></td><td><p>T, S, M</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.IpntuLzSdJyI58bV]{Arcus Heavy}</p></td><td><p>T, S, M</p></td><td><p>130</p></td><td><p>13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.cODm9p7CdqTGn4rL]{Pulse Green}</p></td><td><p>T, S, M</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.Zsbbz46AwhyFvoS1]{Pulse Red}</p></td><td><p>T, S, M</p></td><td><p>175</p></td><td><p>17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.W4pwstI6ZBcSpA8G]{Pulse Blue}</p></td><td><p>T, S, M</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.TiKMewavAZAYO3l8]{Arcus Ultra}</p></td><td><p>S, M, L</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ecDUr57mb4gBTlWN]{Arcus Maximum}</p></td><td><p>S, M, L</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.FRW86Hwtbc5nahpy]{Pulse Orange}</p></td><td><p>S, M, L</p></td><td><p>250</p></td><td><p>25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.CcOqyLEHVrth2FI1]{Pulse Prismatic}</p></td><td><p>S, M, L</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.x6yk6xHYkqfi6k6r]{Nova Light}</p></td><td><p>M, L, H</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ul5mOpaWuoBHZaE9]{Nova Heavy}</p></td><td><p>M, L, H</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.9hG6k1Ldn37hG7Zt]{Nova Ultra}</p></td><td><p>M, L, H</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.UieTC37N5MWJKdn4]{Gateway Light}</p></td><td><p>L, H, G</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.58wLCn7dSJCUyzzb]{Gateway Heavy}</p></td><td><p>L, H, G</p></td><td><p>400</p></td><td><p>40</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.3vxdiVT2YSjIrErO]{Gateway Ultra}</p></td><td><p>H, G, C</p></td><td><p>500</p></td><td><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.Sj5mmfqyk3AnYmnh]{Titan Light}</p></td><td><p>Sc</p></td><td><p>700</p></td><td><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.zbhczZvSM7bnhQBx]{Titan Heavy}</p></td><td><p>Sc</p></td><td><p>950</p></td><td><p>60</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.pJBcGOkUToG3lBPG]{Titan Ultra}</p></td><td><p>Sc</p></td><td><p>1200</p></td><td><p>70</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Power Budget</h3><p>Most starship systems consume power. The starship’s power core provides this power in terms of power core units (PCU). The PCUs needed for all of a starship's systems can exceed the total PCUs provided by the core, but usage can't exceed the available PCUs—if it would, some systems must be inactive. For a starship to be fully effective in combat, its defensive countermeasures, shields, thrusters, and weapons shouldn’t consume more power than the core provides.</p><p></p><h2>THRUSTERS</h2><p>Ships rely on conventional thrusters to move between locations in a system, to navigate the reaches of the Drift once they arrive there, to explore, and to engage in combat They are designed for ships of a specific size (specified in the Size column of the table below), and they can’t be installed in a ship of an incorrect size. The maximum speed of a starship’s thrusters either grants a bonus or imparts a penalty to Piloting checks to fly the vessel, as noted on the table below.</p><p>Thrusters are also used when landing on and taking off from a planet. Large and smaller Starships generally have little difficulty landing on and taking off from a planet with low gravity or standard gravity (unless there are atmospheric conditions such as high winds or storms). The GM determines whether or not a starship’s pilot must attempt a Piloting check to land a starship with a speed lower than 8 on a planet with high gravity, with failure meaning it might crash. Due to their sheer size, Huge and larger starships can’t land on planets, and must use shuttles or other means to ferry crew and goods to a planet and back.</p><table

that must be met before they can be installed on a ship. Frequently, these requirements demand a certain amount of power or a specific starship size or tier. Some systems are so standardized that the different types available are simply referred to by their mark (mk), expressing the typical bonus provided.</p><h3>Armor</h3><p>Armor protects a ship from direct-fire weapons (see Type on page 303), deflecting their energy and preventing damage to critical ship systems. It grants an armor bonus to a ship’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.J7WeYeUHpI9FdW23#armor-class-(ac)]{AC}. Armor’s cost depends on the bonus it grants and the ship’s size category (for the purpose of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, Huge = 5, Gargantuan = 6, Colossal = 7, Supercolossal = 8). Armor is a passive system and does not require any PCU to remain functional. It provides protection primarily through mass, which can affect a ship’s maneuverability (making it harder to turn) and make it easier for opponents using tracking weapons to lock on to the ship—these effects are listed in the Special column of the table below.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>NAME</p></td><td><p>BONUSTO AC</p></td><td><p>SPECIAL</p></td><td><p>COST (IN BP)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.M0CtHWqXjpcksqXQ]{Mk 1 armor}</p></td><td><p>+1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>1 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.olNKEjLBu6GK2Qze]{Mk 2 armor}</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>2 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.Ih8xQ7vVFMe3HHpc]{Mk 3 armor}</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>3 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.H8ql1F7NamJ7KCws]{Mk 4 armor}</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>5 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.EvGFVG17M7ooq75r]{Mk 5 armor}</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>7 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.g5Xky3Bc9VHbPCfb]{Mk 6 armor}</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>9 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.m9n5mUjKRGnRELqK]{Mk 7 armor}</p></td><td><p>+7</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>12 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.M9eFD5mRWzzdZNUf]{Mk 8 armor}</p></td><td><p>+8</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>15 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.HN0LO3W7oBxUntjd]{Mk 9 armor}</p></td><td><p>+9</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>18 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.0Uk6o2QUtw23jFaE]{Mk 10 armor}</p></td><td><p>+10</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>21 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.tEEuQx2dVfaSUM4P]{Mk 11 armor}</p></td><td><p>+11</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>25 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.kK4QZJUAnvAnVqxE]{Mk 12 armor}</p></td><td><p>+12</p></td><td><p>–3 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>30 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.rM5u9y4MjiIodqnI]{Mk 13 armor}</p></td><td><p>+13</p></td><td><p>–3 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>35 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.hW09HBHLKeq0uYUd]{Mk 14 armor}</p></td><td><p>+14</p></td><td><p>–3 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>40 × size category</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.P0W3Ko8rKsWMSI64]{Mk 15 armor}</p></td><td><p>+15</p></td><td><p>–4 TL, +3 turn distance</p></td><td><p>45 × size category</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Ablative Armor</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 20</p><p>By layering inexpensive metal and composite plates over existing bulkheads, a ship can absorb initial damage to its hull before its essential components become vulnerable to attack or hostile environments. However, thicker plates are bulky and interfere with the maneuverability and handling of starships. Ablative armor grants a starship temporary Hull Points to each quadrant, usually distributed evenly. When a starship would take damage to its Hull Points, it first reduces its temporary Hull Points from ablative armor in that quadrant. Once a starship’s temporary Hull Points in a quadrant are reduced to 0, any further damage to that quadrant not absorbed by shields is applied to the ship’s Hull Points. The loss of temporary Hull Points does not count toward the starship’s critical threshold, though for all other effects, any attack that reduces a starship’s temporary Hull Points is treated as though it had dealt Hull Point damage to the target.</p><p>In most cases, ablative armor is applied evenly, distributing its temporary Hull Points between all four quadrants. However, a starship can support uneven distribution at the cost of the starship’s handling, though the vessel can add only a limited amount of extra armor to smaller hulls. If a starship’s ablative armor is not installed evenly across all four quadrants, reduce the starship’s base frame Piloting modifier by 1 (minimum –3). Reduce the Piloting modifier by 1 if the temporary Hull Points granted by ablative armor exceed the starship’s Hull Point total. A starship cannot support ablative armor if its temporary Hull Points exceed twice its standard Hull Point total.</p><p>Ablative armor can be restored only when the starship undergoes repairs, and it is repaired at the same rate and cost as standard Hull Points. A starship’s Hull Points must be fully repaired before making repairs to any temporary Hull Points provided by ablative armor.</p><p><strong>TABLE 1–4: ABLATIVE ARMOR</strong></p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>ABLATIVE ARMOR</p></td><td><p>TOTALTEMP HP</p></td><td><p>SPECIAL</p></td><td><p>COST (BP)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic ablative armor</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic ablative armor</p></td><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic ablative armor</p></td><td><p>24</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic ablative armor</p></td><td><p>32</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic ablative armor</p></td><td><p>40</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light ablative armor</p></td><td><p>52</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light ablative armor</p></td><td><p>64</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light ablative armor</p></td><td><p>76</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light ablative armor</p></td><td><p>88</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Light ablative armor</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>–1 TL</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium ablative armor</p></td><td><p>120</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium ablative armor</p></td><td><p>140</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium ablative armor</p></td><td><p>160</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>19</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium ablative armor</p></td><td><p>180</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>21</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium ablative armor</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +1 turn distance</p></td><td><p>22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy ablative armor</p></td><td><p>240</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>24</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy ablative armor</p></td><td><p>280</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>27</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy ablative armor</p></td><td><p>320</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>29</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy ablative armor</p></td><td><p>360</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>31</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy ablative armor</p></td><td><p>400</p></td><td><p>–2 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>34</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Superior ablative armor</p></td><td><p>460</p></td><td><p>–3 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>38</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Superior ablative armor</p></td><td><p>520</p></td><td><p>–4 TL, +2 turn distance</p></td><td><p>45</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Computer</h3><p>A computer system functions in many ways as a ship’s brain. Most computers aboard starships have at least a rudimentary artificial personality, and while they can’t fully perform the duties of a crew member, they can assist crew members in various tasks. However, many spacefarers claim that over time, a starship’s computers can develop temperaments and personality quirks that set them apart from identical computers in other ships. A starship has a basic computer of a tier equal to half the starship’s tier (minimum 1); see the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.2pVc2RYq2wkbkBEs]{Computers} skill on page 137 and Computers on page 213 for more information about how a starship computer can be hacked or upgraded. Which upgrades a crew can purchase for its starship computer is determined by the GM; some upgrades can be purchased with @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#starship-scale]{Build Points} (see page 294).</p><p>While a starship’s computer is responsible for operating and managing a wide variety of starship systems at any given point in time, only a starship with an integrated control module (ICM) can aid the crew in starship combat (the basic computer listed on the table below is the only option that lacks an ICM). In general, an ICM adds a flat circumstance bonus to one or more starship combat checks, decided just before the check is attempted. An ICM has a number of nodes; each node grants its bonus to one starship combat check per round. Multiple nodes allow an ICM to influence multiple starship combat checks in a round, but they do not allow a computer to add multiple bonuses to the same starship combat check.</p><p>The cost of an ICM for the starship’s computer is equal to the bonus it grants squared, multiplied by its number of nodes. ICMs can be purchased only with Build Points, not with credits.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td

These quarters can range from hammocks strung between cargo containers to cozy chambers with custom furnishings and private bathrooms. Crew quarters consume a negligible amount of PCU, though amenities in fancier quarters require an operational power core to function.</p><p>On a Supercolossal ship with common crew quarters, the vessel’s size enables 10% of the crew to have good quarters and 1% to have luxurious quarters at no additional cost. On a Supercolossal ship with good quarters for the majority of the crew, 10% have luxurious quarters at no additional cost.</p><h4>Common</h4><p>Common crew quarters are the most basic type. They consist of simple bunks (sometimes folding out from the side of a hallway) or other similarly austere places to rest. Crew members who sleep in common quarters usually keep their personal possessions in a footlocker. Common crew quarters also include a communal bathroom (which includes a military-style shower) and a tiny galley (big enough to prepare only the most basic of meals). Starships with crews numbering in the dozens or hundreds often have massive barracks where crew members sleep in shifts.</p><h4>Good</h4><p>Good crew quarters are a bit more upscale than common crew quarters. They consist of dormitory-style rooms that can hold one or two small beds (larger starships usually require lower-ranking crew members to share these quarters) and sometimes a personal closet or drawer space for each occupant. Good crew quarters also include one or two shared bathrooms with multiple sinks and shower stalls, and a dining space with an attached galley. Crews of larger starships eat in this dining space in shifts.</p><h4>Luxurious</h4><p>Luxurious crew quarters are the pinnacle of comfort. They consist of private rooms for each crew member, with personal bathrooms (including showers with high water pressure) and furnishings that match the resident’s tastes.

Sensors are a combination of video cameras, multispectrum scanners, radar arrays, signal interceptors, and optical telescopes. In starship combat, short-range sensors have a range of 5 hexes, medium-range sensors have a range of 10 hexes, and long-range sensors have a range of 20 hexes. All sensors have a skill modifier that applies to any skill used in conjunction with them. Sensors require an operational power core to function, but they consume a negligible amount of PCU.</p><p>Sensors operate in two modes: passive or active. In passive mode, sensors automatically scan the ship’s surroundings. Passive sensors detect visible or unhidden objects in a 360-degree field around the ship at a range of up to twice the sensors’ range category while in space or in the Drift (no skill check required), though local conditions may affect their range. However, gravitational forces and atmospheric conditions limit starship sensors to a range of 250 feet on most planets, and their range might be further limited by terrain, at the GM’s discretion.</p><p>Active sensors are far more discerning, and they are required if the science officer wishes to scan enemy vessels and learn details about them during @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ]{starship combat} (see page 325). The modifier listed in the table below applies to some checks attempted by the science officer in starship combat as specified in the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.5aDDs3JOrLE2e0uX#science-officer-actions]{science officer’s actions} (see page 324). Active sensors can discern information about a target up to five times the sensors’ range away from the ship, but such checks take a penalty of –2 for each range increment beyond the first to the target. For example, if short-range sensors (range = 5 hexes) were used against a target 12 hexes away, the check would take a –4 penalty.</p><p>Outside of starship combat, a crew member can use sensors to scan a planet the starship is orbiting, attempting a Computers check (applying the sensors’ modifier) to learn basic information about the planet’s composition and atmosphere. The DC for this check is usually 15, but it can be altered at the GM’s discretion to account for mitigating factors or complications. A crew member can also use the starship’s active sensors to attempt Perception checks to examine the surrounding area as if she were standing outside the starship, using her own senses (such as darkvision), but adding the sensors’ modifier as a circumstance bonus to the check.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>SENSORS</p></td><td><p>RANGE</p></td><td><p>MODIFIER</p></td><td><p>COST (IN BP)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.Szuzv90TqjqXSo71]{Cut-rate}</p></td><td><p>Short</p></td><td><p>–2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.XVlD4JptgNKX4nKD]{Budget short-range}</p></td><td><p>Short</p></td><td><p>+0</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.yGGCtDmrM2DOlOTu]{Basic short-range}</p></td><td><p>Short</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.jlFsFnCEziseqCnz]{Advanced short-range}</p></td><td><p>Short</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.0trN3sCvbxEyVfzv]{Budget medium-range}</p></td><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>+0</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.btvgCHVdcXR9MfCA]{Basic medium-range}</p></td><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.lwo7N1Z4mPGHGwtK]{Advanced medium-range}</p></td><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.QSn7vESYqBjDbPPN]{Budget long-range}</p></td><td><p>Long</p></td><td><p>+0</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.1ZePYtgE8CHF3CJw]{Basic long-range}</p></td><td><p>Long</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.jzgtV8eA6eODGsFi]{Advanced long-range}</p></td><td><p>Long</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Shields</h3><p>While almost every ship has simple navigational shielding to prevent damage from tiny bits of debris, this protection does little to stop a starship from being damaged by lasers, missiles, and larger impacts. To defend against such threats, a ship has energy shields, though these shields don’t count as force effects. Projectors mounted around the ship create a barrier that absorbs damage from attacks. Each attack reduces the number of Shield Points (SP) in a given arc until that arc’s shields are depleted, after which point all further damage in that arc reduces the ship’s Hull Points. See @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.oEDt7byMjC9PQFj7]{Damage} on page 304 for more information.

sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 20-21</span></p><p>Whereas conventional starship shields absorb attacks entirely until they are depleted, some engineers insist that shields are most effective when deflecting attacks, blunting their force or causing them to miss entirely. Deflector shield technology reduces damage from incoming attacks and increases a starship’s AC and TL, though each successive attack depletes the shields’ defensive potential. Deflector shields and conventional shields create fields that interfere with each other, so only one of these two defenses can be installed on a starship.</p><p>Fully functioning deflector shields provide a starship the defense value (DV) listed in Table 1–5 (page 21) to each quadrant. Whenever the starship would take damage, it ignores an amount of that damage equal to its defense value in that quadrant. Deflector shields are twice as effective against attacks from melee, ramming, and ripper starship weapons, so the starship ignores double the amount of damage from such attacks. Any attack that would ignore a fraction or all of a target’s shields instead reduces the amount of damage the deflector shields ignore by an equal amount, rounded in the defender’s favor (e.g., deflector shields with a defense value of 5 would reduce damage from a burrowing weapon [Pact Worlds 153] by 3). While the deflector shields’ defense value in a quadrant is 1 or higher, the shields increase the starship’s AC and TL against attacks in that quadrant by the listed amount.</p><p>Whenever an attack or effect damages a starship’s Hull Points, the deflector shields’ defense value in that quadrant also decreases by 1, reducing the amount of damage they can ignore. Weapons with the array or line special property that damage a starship’s Hull Points overwhelm its deflector shields, reducing their defense value in that quadrant by 2, whereas vortex weapons that deal Hull Point damage reduce the target’s deflector shields’ defense value in each quadrant by 1d4. Any successful attack by a weapon with the buster special property (or another special property that deals reduced damage to Hull Points) reduces the deflector shields’ defense value in the struck quadrant by 2, whether or not the attack damaged the target’s Hull Points. When a gunnery check results in a natural 20, any decrease to the target’s deflector shield’s defense value from the attack is 1 greater.</p><p>When an engineer uses the divert action to send power to shields, they increase the defense value of a single quadrant by 2, or the defense value of each quadrant by 1, up to the deflector shields’ maximum defense value per quadrant. For every 150 PCU provided by a starship’s power core, increase the defense value restored to one quadrant by 1. When a science officer uses the balance action, they can adjust their deflector shields’ defense values in the same way as they would shift or distribute Shield Points, though each quadrant must have a defense value of at least 1 afterward. When a starship is not engaged in combat or otherwise taking damage, the defense value for each quadrant regenerates at a rate of 1 per minute.</p><p><strong>TABLE 1–5: DEFLECTOR SHIELDS</strong></p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>DEFLECTOR SHIELD</p></td><td><p>DV</p></td><td><p>AC/TL</p></td><td><p>PCU</p></td><td><p>COST (BP)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.NTRhbynPwLxcMCmL]{Basic deflector shield 1}</p></td><td><p>1/—</p></td><td><p>+1 AC/+1 TL</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ZIB9wS583kCVHI5h]{Basic deflector shield 3}</p></td><td><p>3/—</p></td><td><p>+1 AC/+1 TL</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.xwrcCtZnYKP81Q8s]{Light deflector shield 5}</p></td><td><p>5/—</p></td><td><p>+1 AC/+2 TL</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.gqVsHEFAYID3uhOz]{Light deflector shield 8}</p></td><td><p>8/—</p></td><td><p>+1 AC/+2 TL</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.SeEHZIjaxvHnDMJ8]{Medium deflector shield 10}</p></td><td><p>10/—</p></td><td><p>+2 AC/+2 TL</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.8VekzQLxr7cxMJrP]{Medium deflector shield 12}</p></td><td><p>12/—</p></td><td><p>+2 AC/+2 TL</p></td><td><p>45</p></td><td><p>26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.gpc6UnOb9EJVm7ow]{Heavy deflector shield 13}</p></td><td><p>13/—</p></td><td><p>+2 AC/+3 TL</p></td><td><p>60</p></td><td><p>33</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.rnGBx5zFpcKugLsq]{Heavy deflector shield 15}</p></td><td><p>15/—</p></td><td><p>+2 AC/+3 TL</p></td><td><p>80</p></td><td><p>36</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.LCcSMvysuoSWPyoN]{Superior deflector shield 18}</p></td><td><p>18/—</p></td><td><p>+3 AC/+3 TL</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>45</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.mU2ZKodsgd84bEfV]{Superior deflector shield 20}</p></td><td><p>20/—</p></td><td><p>+3 AC/+3 TL</p></td><td><p>120</p></td><td><p>50</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Fortified Hull</h3><p><span style=\"font-family:'Exo 2', sans-serif\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Source</strong>: SOM, p. 21</span></p><p>By reinforcing critical starship systems with extra-thick armor, a starship’s designer can limit catastrophic failures caused by incoming attacks.

As a result, most ships protect themselves with a variety of weapons, ranging from laser cannons to solar torpedoes.</p><p>Weapons must be installed on special mounts on a ship, specified in the ship’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#base-frame]{base frame} (see page 294). These mounts are designed for optimal firing and are placed so that they can be easily tied into the ship’s power and control systems. They also prevent the weapon from affecting the course or speed of a ship when fired.</p><p>Weapons are classified using the following key statistics.</p><h3>Name</h3><p>This is the name of the weapon.</p><h3>Class</h3><p>Weapons belong to one of three classifications. Light weapons can be mounted on any ship but are most typically found on smaller fighters and bombers. While dangerous, light weapons do not have the firepower necessary to damage very large starships. Heavy weapons are a serious threat to any vessel but can be mounted only on Medium or larger starships. Capital weapons can be mounted only on Huge or larger starships. Capital weapons can’t be brought to bear against Tiny or Small targets and are typically used only against other large vessels.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>Starship weapons are one of two types. Direct-fire weapons fire projectiles or beams at amazing speed, targeting the opposing vessel’s AC. Tracking weapons’ projectiles are slower and must home in using a target’s TL. A tracking weapon’s projectile has a listed speed; once fired, it moves that number of hexes toward its target. Each subsequent round during the gunnery phase, it must succeed at a gunnery check against the target’s TL to continue to move its speed toward its target. On a failure, the projectile is lost. If the projectile reaches the target’s hex, it deals the listed damage.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>Weapons have one of three ranges: short range (5 hexes), medium range (10 hexes), or long range (20 hexes). As with character-scale ranged attacks, an attack with a starship weapon takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each range increment (or fraction thereof, beyond the first) between it and the target. A gunner firing a tracking weapon takes a range penalty only on her first gunnery check, when the target is first acquired. A starship weapon can fire at a target up to 10 range increments away.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>This is the distance in hexes a tracking weapon moves toward its target each round during the gunnery phase. Projectiles from a tracking weapon have perfect maneuverability, and as such, they have a minimum @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.iuRklGcMf04Q8CjD#turns]{turn} distance of 0 (see page 319)</p><h3>Damage</h3><p>This is the amount of damage (in Hull Points) the weapon deals when it successfully hits a target. See @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.prwFRuwtGYNChHlr#shooting-starships]{Shooting Starships} on page 292 for guidelines on how starship weapons can affect characters.</p><h3>PCU</h3><p>This is the amount of PCU consumed by the weapon. It uses this amount continuously whenever the weapon is powered up and ready to fire.</p><h3>Cost</h3><p>This is the cost of the weapon in Build Points.</p><p></p><h2>Light Weapons</h2><h3>Direct-Fire

Properties</h2><p>Some weapons have special properties, as noted in Table 9–2 on pages 302–303. These special properties and how they affect starship combat are described here.</p><h3>Anchoring</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 12-13</p><p>A weapon with this special property fires ammunition tethered to a powerful chain, anchoring the attacking starship to its target. While anchored to each other, neither starship can move farther away from each other than the range at which the anchoring weapon was initially fired. While a starship is anchored and adjacent to its target, its crew can attempt to board (page 40) the anchored starship at the end of the starship combat round. An anchoring weapon can’t be used to make additional attacks or anchor other vessels if it’s currently being used to anchor a target.</p><p>As a special engineer action, an engineer can attempt to sever or dislodge another starship’s anchor with an Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the anchoring starship’s tier). If they succeed, the effects of the anchoring weapon special property end. As a special stunt, a pilot can attempt to shake free of an anchor with a Piloting check at the same DC. If they succeed, the effects of the anchoring weapon special property end and the starship moves up to half its speed. If they fail, the starship moves in a straight line, though no farther than the range allowed by the anchoring weapon.</p><p>A starship’s gunner or engineer can detach any number of their own weapons’ anchors as a minor crew action.</p><h3>Array</h3><p>An array weapon fires at all targets within a single firing arc. The gunner attempts a single gunnery check against each target in the firing arc, starting with those closest to her starship. Each gunnery check takes a –4 penalty, which stacks with other penalties. Roll damage only once for all targets. Critical damage is determined by each target’s Critical Threshold. The gunner can’t avoid shooting at allies in the firing arc, nor can she shoot any target more than once. An array weapon uses two weapon mounts.</p><h3>Automated</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 13</p><p>A weapon with this special property can aim and fire autonomously following its programmed protocols. Unless manually operated by a gunner or instructed not to attack, the weapon fires every round during the gunnery phase, using the shoot crew action with a total gunnery bonus equal to the starship’s tier (minimum +0). It always fires at the closest enemy starship in range; if more than one enemy vessel is equally close, the weapon determines its target among these options at random. Weapons with the @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#mine]{mine} special property (page 14) can’t also have the automated special property.</p><h3>Broad Arc</h3><p>A weapon with this special property can fire in an arc adjacent to the one in which it was installed with a –2 penalty. A broad arc weapon can fire at only one target at a time.</p><h3>Burrowing</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: PW, pg. 153</p><p>A weapon with this special property fires a highly focused beam of energy that can slice through shields with ease. Burrowing weapons are always short range and cannot fire at targets outside the first range increment. When a burrowing weapon’s beam hits shields, apply half of its damage to the shields and the other half (rounded down) to the target vessel’s Hull Points. If any of the damage applied to the shields depletes those shields, apply the remainder to the ship’s Hull Points as normal. If a burrowing weapon deals damage to a ship with a damage threshold, halve that threshold before determining if any damage is dealt.</p><h3>Buster</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 13</p><p>A weapon with this special property fires blasts of disruptive energy that devastate shields but have difficulty penetrating physical armor. A buster weapon deals the indicated damage to a starship’s shields. If the shields in the quadrant are reduced to 0, split any remaining damage between the two adjacent quadrants’ shields. If the targeted quadrant’s shields and the shields of any adjacent quadrants are reduced to 0, halve any remaining damage before applying it to the starship’s Hull Points. During a starship’s next engineering phase after being hit by a buster weapon (whether or not its shields were depleted), the DC of Engineering checks to divert power to the starship’s shields increases by 5.</p><h3>Deployed</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 13-14</p><p>A weapon with this special property consists of a launcher containing tiny armed drones that chase and attack nearby foes. A gunner can launch a drone by performing the deploy drone gunner action (page 15), causing the drone to appear in an adjacent hex at the beginning of the next round. The drone has a speed of 4 and good maneuverability (turn 1). It can perform one crew action and one minor crew action per round, though these actions are limited to fly, glide, shoot, and snap shot, with total Piloting and gunnery bonuses equal to the launching starship’s tier. The drone attacks only targets that are within its weapon’s first range increment, and a drone can make only three attacks before expending its energy reserves and becoming disabled. For all other purposes, a deployed drone functions as a Tiny starship with an AC and TL equal to 12 + the launching starship’s tier and total HP equal to twice the launching starship’s tier. A drone lacks shields, has no quadrants, and does not take critical damage.</p><p>Deployed weapons can’t already have the limited fire special property, and these weapons can be mounted on only a Medium or larger starship. A deployed weapon gains the automated and limited fire 3 special properties</p><h3>EMP</h3><p>A weapon with this special property emits a beam of electromagnetic energy that does not deal damage to ships or shields, but plays havoc with a ship’s electronic systems. On a hit, an EMP weapon scrambles one of the target starship’s systems, determined randomly. This causes that system to act as if it had the glitching condition for 1d4 rounds. If the system is already damaged, instead increase its critical damage by one level of severity for 1d4 rounds. Whenever an EMP weapon scores critical damage, it scrambles two systems at random. Systems damaged by EMP weapons can be patched or repaired as normal. Functioning shields are unaffected by EMP weapons and completely block an EMP weapon’s effects.</p><h3>Force Field</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 14</p><p>A force field weapon leverages the attacking starship’s shields as a deadly bludgeon. A force field weapon deals additional damage equal to its starship’s Shield Points (SP) in the weapon’s quadrant, with a maximum bonus damage value equal to the number listed with this special property. A turret-mounted force field weapon uses the current SP of the quadrant from which it’s fired. A force field weapon cannot be fired from any quadrant that has 0 SP. Immediately upon firing a force field weapon—and before resolving any enemy attacks during the gunnery phase—the attacking starship loses a number of SP in that weapon’s quadrant equal to the number listed with this special property. Weapons with the force field special property are not compatible with @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#deflector-shields]{deflector shields}.</p><h3>Gravity Well</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 14</p><p>A gravity well module—which includes gravity generators, gravity well generators, and interdiction arrays—manipulates gravitational forces around the targeted starship, slowing the starship considerably. Until the end of the next piloting phase, the target’s speed is halved, and its maneuverability becomes one step worse (to at worst clumsy maneuverability). A gravity well module requires tremendous energy to operate; it cannot be activated unless an engineer succeeds at a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.RKHIOu4uCqrEcFoC]{divert} crew action to divert power to the weapons that round.</p><h3>Hacking</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 14</p><p>A hacking module remotely overpowers another starship’s onboard computer systems. An affected starship loses all control of its integrated control module (ICM) for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which the science officer’s special gunnery check exceeds the target’s TL. Instead, the hacking module’s science officer gains control of the affected starship’s ICM and can apply the flat circumstance bonuses the ICM would typically apply as penalties of equal value to one or more starship combat checks, representing the hacker’s interference with the thrusters, communications, and even the internal lights of the targeted starship. For example, a science officer who has taken control of a starship’s mk 2 trinode computer (which normally grants +2 bonuses to three different checks) could apply a –2 penalty to three different starship combat checks per round. A heavy or capital hacking module increases the flat penalty value by 1. A capital hacking module can also apply the penalty to one additional starship combat check per round.</p><p>The science officer must apply a penalty before the affected starship’s crew attempts a check. Although the science officer knows when one of the affected starship’s crew members is attempting a check and the type of check (such as knowing that a gunner is about to use the shoot action), hacking into the starship provides the science officer no special knowledge of the starship’s armaments or its crew’s capabilities.</p><p>A starship’s effective TL against gunnery checks attempted by a hacking module increases by 1 for each @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.uNUyQLcwT8MB2165]{anti-hacking system} (Core Rulebook 300) it has. During the engineering phase, an affected starship’s science officer can use their action to end the hacking effects with a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the enemy starship’s tier). This science officer gains a circumstance bonus to this check equal to their starship’s number of anti-hacking systems.</p><h3>Intimidating</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 14</p><p>An intimidating weapon strikes fear in the crew of any starships hit. After a starship hits another starship with an intimidating weapon, its captain gains one of the following benefits during the following round: the captain can perform the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.rduQ5X6UqXWduwRQ]{taunt} action against a starship that has already been taunted once during that combat, the captain can choose two phases of combat to affect when using the taunt action against that starship, or the captain gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the Intimidate check to taunt the attacked ship.</p><h3>Irradiate</h3><p>A weapon with this special property creates a wave of harmful radiation (see page 403) that penetrates shields and starship hulls. Living creatures on a starship struck by an irradiating weapon are subjected to the level of radiation noted in parentheses for 1d4 rounds of starship combat.</p><h3>Limited Fire</h3><p>A weapon with this special property can fire only the listed number of times in a starship combat encounter before it requires a brief period of time (10 minutes outside of starship combat) to recharge and rebuild the weapon’s inherent ammunition. A weapon with this special property is often a tracking weapon.</p><h3>Line</h3><p>A weapon with this special property fires a beam in a straight line that can pierce through multiple targets. The gunner attempts a single gunnery check and compares the result to the AC of all ships in a line originating from her starship and extending to the weapon’s range increment. Roll the weapon’s damage once and apply it to each target with an AC equal to or lower than the gunner’s result, starting with the closest. If any of that damage is negated due to a ship’s @UUID[.prwFRuwtGYNChHlr#damage-threshold-(dt):]{Damage Threshold}, the beam is stopped and the attack doesn’t deal damage to targets farther away.</p><h3>Mine</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 14-15</p><p>A weapon with this special property (referred to as the launcher) can be mounted only in a starship’s aft quadrant and can be activated only using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.FQJePy9WOiWXT0SO]{lay mines} gunner crew action (page 15) during the helm phase. A launcher cannot be activated using the fire at will, shoot, broadside, or precise targeting crew actions. Launchers are typically tracking weapons with the limited fire special property, and each time one is activated, it spreads the indicated number of mines over an equal number of hexes along the starship’s flight path. A deployed mine has an AC and TL equal to 12 + the launching starship’s tier, and each mine has 1 Hull Point. A mine’s effective speed is 4 when targeted by point weapons.</p><p>Anytime a starship exits a hex adjacent to a mine, the gunner who placed the mine attempts an immediate gunnery check against the triggering starship’s TL. If they succeed, the mine deals its listed damage and effects to the starship’s aft quadrant, after which the mine is destroyed. If a starship would enter a hex containing a mine, the gunner who placed the mine instead attempts an immediate gunnery check as above but with a +2 circumstance bonus against the triggering starship’s TL, and any damage is dealt to the starship’s forward quadrant. If a mine’s gunnery check fails, the mine remains in that hex, and the triggering starship can complete its movement without further risk from that mine during that phase.</p><p>Mines don’t activate until a few moments after being dispersed so as not to damage their launching starship. If a starship would trigger a mine’s attack during the same helm phase in which it was dispersed, the triggering starship gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its TL against the mine’s gunnery check.</p><h3>Mystical</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 15</p><p>When attempting a gunnery check with a mystical weapon, which is a hybrid device, a gunner can use their ranks in Mysticism in place of either their base attack bonus or ranks in Piloting, and their Wisdom modifier in place of their Dexterity modifier.</p><h3>Nav-Scram</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 15</p><p>A nav-scram module projects a burst of subatomic particles to interfere with and overload navigational equipment. During the next round’s helm phase, the pilot of a starship affected by a nav-scram must roll their Piloting check twice and take the worse result when determining the order in which starships move during that round. A heavy or capital nav-scram module instead causes the affected starship’s pilot to roll Piloting checks twice and take the lower results during the next round. A capital nav-scram module’s effects last 1d3 rounds.</p><h3>Numbing</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 15</p><p>A numbing weapon fires concentrated entropic energy. Living creatures on a starship that takes damage to its Hull Points from a numbing weapon must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the firing starship’s tier) or take a –2 penalty to starship combat actions for 1d3 rounds.</p><h3>Orbital</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 15-16</p><p>An orbital weapon is cumbersome yet powerful, designed to devastate immense targets or bombard planetary surfaces. During starship combat, attacks using an orbital weapon take a –4 penalty to the gunnery check if the target is a Medium or smaller vessel, or a –2 penalty if it’s a Large, Huge, or Gargantuan vessel.</p><p>A gunner can also fire an orbital weapon at a large, stationary target, such as a settlement or battlefield. The effects follow the guidelines below. These guidelines are somewhat flexible so as to limit the degree to which a PC’s starship might obliterate a key site or to allow an NPC starship’s strike to deal the necessary structural damage without outright annihilating the PCs.</p><p>Orbital attacks have an immense range: orbital weapons with short range can strike large targets from low orbit (approximately 1,000 miles for a Golarion-sized planet), medium range orbital weapons are effective from high orbit (approximately 20,000 miles), and long-range orbital weapons can strike from extraordinary ranges of 100,000 miles or more. When an orbital weapon strikes an area, it damages everything in a 100-foot radius for a light weapon, 500-foot radius for a heavy weapon, 2,500-foot radius for a capital weapon, or a mile radius or larger for a spinal-mount weapon. Orbital weapons rarely fire faster than once every 10 minutes during bombardments, and spinal-mount weapons can rarely fire more than once per hour.</p><p>Orbital weapons deal 10 × their listed damage to inanimate objects in the affected area, damaging or outright destroying many structures (Core Rulebook 408). Against vehicles, living creatures, and other smaller targets in the affected area, an orbital weapon’s damage, effects, and other statistics are best approximated using the trap creation guidelines (Core Rulebook 411–412) for a trap with a CR equal to the value listed with the weapon’s orbital special property.</p><p>Orbital weapons require additional features to function properly on most ships. Any starship modified by the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ScaDRf432uQe0jXH]{colony ship framework} (page 28) or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.1mcCblo0STTbOO3a]{space station framework} (page 29) is sufficiently fortified to mount orbital weapons without needing such extra features, reducing an orbital weapon’s BP cost by one-third.</p><h3>Pod</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 16</p><p>A pod weapon is mounted to a starship’s exterior and includes its own power supply, making its PCU cost negligible. A pod weapon does not require a weapon mount but must nonetheless be installed on a specific quadrant. Pod weapons are too unwieldy to mount on a turret, and a starship can mount only a single pod weapon on each quadrant. Any starship can support light pod weapons, whereas a starship must be Medium or Huge to support heavy or capital pod weapons, respectively.</p><p>Pod weapons are fragile due to their exposed nature. If a starship’s hull takes damage, any pod weapons in the damaged quadrant gain the wrecked critical damage condition. If a starship takes critical damage to a weapons array that contains a pod weapon, any pod weapons in that quadrant are destroyed, and any ammunition the pod weapon contains explodes, dealing additional damage to the starship equal to the pod weapon’s minimum damage multiplied by its remaining number of limited fire uses.</p><h3>Point</h3><p>A weapon with this special property is always short range and can’t be fired against targets that are outside the first range increment. If a tracking weapon would hit a ship in an arc that contains a weapon with the point special property, the gunner of the targeted starship can attempt an immediate gunnery check with the point weapon against the incoming tracking projectile using the bonus listed in parentheses in the weapon’s Special entry (instead of her usual bonus to gunnery checks). The DC for this gunnery check is equal to 10 + the tracking weapon’s speed. If the attack hits, the tracking weapon is destroyed before it can damage the ship. A point weapon can be used to attempt only one such free gunnery check each round, but this usage potentially allows a point weapon to be fired twice in a single round.</p><h3>Quantum</h3><p>Once a gunner fires a quantum weapon, he can reroll one gunnery check (see page 243) for that weapon after its launch if the result would be a miss. Only tracking weapons have this special property.</p><h3>Rail</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 16</p><p>A weapon with this property launches a massive adamantine-alloy spike designed to effortlessly pierce a starship’s hull. For every 5 by which the gunnery check exceeds the target’s AC, the rail weapon’s damage increases by the amount listed with this special property. Rail weapons require exceptional amounts of energy to operate, and their ammunition lacks any homing capabilities. As a result, a rail weapon can be fired only with the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.umc9JwD3YQmZhOyh]{shoot} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.XPBs4pSEl3XYXBE1]{precise targeting} gunner actions, and the attack does not benefit from any science officer actions.</p><h3>Ramming</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 16-17</p><p>A ramming weapon reinforces a starship’s front quadrant to absorb collisions and deal damage when steered into targets. A ramming weapon must be mounted on a starship’s front quadrant. If a ship with a ramming weapon ends its movement adjacent to an enemy ship in its forward arc and the enemy ship has already moved during this helm phase, it can attempt to ram that ship. The pilot immediately attempts a gunnery check against the enemy ship’s AC. If successful, the attack deals a glancing blow that deals the ramming weapon’s listed damage. If the attacking starship is one size category smaller than the enemy ship or larger, the successful attack also pushes the target ship 1 hex in the direction the attacking ship is facing. If this would push the ship into an occupied hex, the ship does not move but instead takes additional damage equal to the attacking starship’s tier. If the pilot’s gunnery check fails, instead of dealing damage, the attacking ship takes damage equal to the ramming weapon’s minimum damage.</p><p>A starship can deal even greater collision damage when using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.y41YyBmHZYus6NCZ.JournalEntryPage.iuRklGcMf04Q8CjD#ramming-speed]{ramming speed} crew action (see sidebar).</p><h3>Restricted</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 17</p><p>This weapon or starship component is typically available only to the listed group, such as the Azlanti Star Empire’s Imperial Fleet.</p><h3>Ripper</h3><p>Firing a blast of metal shards, a weapon with this special property deals terrific damage to a ship’s hull but is almost entirely negated by functioning shields. Halve all damage dealt by ripper weapons to shields. Ripper weapons are always short range.</p><h3>Smart</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 17</p><p>Only weapons with the @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#mine]{mine} special property can have the smart special property. These mines (also known as smart mines) have simple thrusters and sensors, enabling them to slowly drift toward hostile targets. At the end of each helm phase after being dispersed, a smart mine moves 1 hex toward the closest enemy starship within 20 hexes. A smart mine does not enter the same hex as any mine dispersed by its launching starship or that starship’s allies, though it can move into a hex occupied by an enemy mine or neutral obstacle; if it does, the smart mine detonates and deals its damage to the other mine or obstacle.</p><h3>Teleportation</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 17</p><p>A weapon with this special property is capable of teleporting entire starships short distances, in addition to using teleportation technology to forcibly disjoin enemy vessels to deal damage. After hitting an enemy, the gunner chooses whether to deal damage as well as how to teleport the targeted starship. The gunner can move the targeted starship a distance (in hexes) no greater than the value listed with the weapon’s teleportation special property, and the starship appears in the new hex facing the same direction as when it was hit. Alternatively, so long as the two starships are no more than 5 hexes apart, the gunner can cause their starship and the targeted starship to switch positions, with each vessel maintaining its current facing. Any teleportation movement occurs at the end of the gunnery phase, after resolving all other gunnery phase actions and effects. A teleportation weapon cannot move targets that are more than one size category larger than the attacking vessel, and teleportation weapons are unable to move supermassive targets such as planetoids or other immense objects, at the GM’s discretion.</p><h3>Tractor Beam</h3><p>A weapon with this special property can generate a stable beam of gravitons, creating a tractor beam that can move other ships. In addition to dealing damage, a hit with a tractor beam prevents the target ship from moving normally. The gunner can push or pull the target ship (at a rate of 2 hexes per round, resolved at the beginning of the helm phase), or hold the target ship in place. The pilot of the targeted starship can attempt a Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the tier of the firing ship) to break free of the tractor beam as her action in a round. When a tractor beam weapon is locked on to a starship, it can’t be used as a regular weapon. A tractor beam is effective only against ships of the same size as the firing ship or smaller; larger ships are unaffected by the tractor beam.</p><h3>Transposition</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 17</p><p>A transposition module disperses magitech beacons attuned to its starship, enabling the ship to teleport short distances. Transposition modules typically have the @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#mine]{mine} special property (page 14) and are thus mounted on the aft quadrant and disperse inanimate warp pucks in one or more hexes. However, unlike most mines, a warp puck doesn’t harm nearby starships. Instead, the launching starship’s science officer can try to teleport the starship into the puck’s hex using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-actions.Item.f7azdHY89WWjV1Ti]{recall beacon} crew action (page 15). After the science officer performs this action, that warp puck is destroyed.</p><p>The maximum distance a starship can teleport by activating a warp puck depends on the starship’s size category (for this calculation, Supercolossal = 0, Colossal = 1, Gargantuan = 2, Huge = 3, etc.). A ship cannot teleport farther than a number of hexes equal to the starship’s size category multiplied by the value listed with the module’s special property.</p><h3>Vortex</h3><p>A weapon with this special property creates a spiraling cyclone of gravitons that tears, crushes, and twists everything in its path, reducing a target ship’s speed by half and reducing its maneuverability by one step for 1d4 rounds on a hit. A ship protected by functioning shields takes no damage from a vortex weapon, but the target ship’s pilot must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the target starship’s tier) or the hit depletes all Shield Points in that arc.</p><h2>LINKING WEAPONS</h2><p>If you install two of the same direct-fire weapon in the same firing arc, you can link them together so they fire as one. This costs a number of Build Points equal to half the cost of one of the weapons (rounded down) and consumes a negligible amount of PCU.</p><p></p><h2>REFITTING AND UPGRADING STARSHIPS</h2><p>As the PCs go on adventures and gain experience, they need an increasingly powerful starship to face tougher challenges. When the characters’ Average Party Level increases, so does the tier of their starship (see Table 9–1: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#starship-scale]{Starship Base Statistics} on page 294). The PCs receive a number of Build Points equal to the Build Points listed for their starship’s new tier – those listed for its previous tier, which they can use to upgrade their starship. For example, a group whose APL increases from 2 to 3 receives 20 BP that the PCs can use to upgrade their starship.</p><p>This could represent salvage gathered during their exploits, an arrangement with a spacedock, or called-in favors from a wealthy patron. Some GMs might require PCs to visit a safe, inhabited world before they can spend these Build Points, but this shouldn’t be allowed to impact the campaign too much. Also remember that at tier 4 and every 4 tiers thereafter, the starship gains an increase in Hull Points equal to the HP increment listed for its base frame.</p><h3>Refitting Systems</h3><p>If the PCs want to alter their starship before receiving additional Build Points (for instance, replacing a weapon with one that costs fewer Build Points or consumes less PCU), they can do so at a friendly spaceport (or safe landing zone) given enough time. If they replace a system or option with one that costs fewer Build Points, they can immediately spend the excess Build Points. Refitting a single system or starship weapon usually takes 1d4 days.</p><h3>Upgrading Systems</h3><p>PCs with Build Points to spare can replace a system or weapon with one that costs more Build Points by paying only the difference in cost between the two systems. If the cost is the same, the system can be upgraded for free, but the crew should keep the amount of PCU the starship’s power core produces in mind so they don’t exceed their power budget. When upgrading a weapon, remember that the starship’s frame starts with a certain number and type of weapon mounts (but see New Weapon Mounts below). Installing a single upgrade usually takes 1d4 days.</p><p>PCs can’t upgrade the base frame of their starship. They can rebuild their starship with a new base frame if they so desire (within the limits of their budget of Build Points, of course), but that new starship will have a different look (and should probably have a different name). PCs can purchase Huge and larger base frames only at the GM’s discretion, as these usually require large crews and thus are normally reserved for NPC starships.</p><p>Buying a whole new starship is a process that can take between 1d4 days and 1d4 months, depending on whether the PCs are purchasing a used starship from a spacedock or having a custom vessel built from scratch.</p><h3>New Weapon Mounts</h3><p>Greater dangers means the PCs will require more powerful weapons in order to survive and triumph. Unless they begin flying around with an escort of armed battlecruisers, the weapons they start with will eventually become inadequate. Bigger weapons require the correct weapon mounts, however. By spending 4 BP, the crew can upgrade a light weapon mount in any of the aft, forward, port, or starboard arcs to a heavy weapon mount. By spending 6 BP, the crew can upgrade a light weapon mount on a turret to a heavy weapon mount.</p><p>By spending 5 Build Points, the crew can upgrade a heavy weapon mount in any of the aft, forward, port, or starboard arcs to a capital weapon mount. Heavy weapons can be mounted on only Medium or larger starships. Capital weapons can be mounted on only Huge or larger starships and can’t be mounted on turrets.</p><p>By spending 3 BP, the crew can fit a new light weapon mount in any of the aft, forward, port, or starboard arcs with enough free space. By spending 5 BP, the crew can fit a new light weapon mount on a turret that has enough free space. Tiny and Small starships can have only two weapon mounts per arc (and per turret). Medium and Large starships can have only three weapon mounts per arc (and per turret). Huge and larger starships can have only four weapon mounts per arc (and per turret).</p><h3>UPGRADING WEAPONS</h3><p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, p. 17</p><p>Starship weaponry can accommodate considerable modification, whether from corporate innovators or independent mechanics. A starship’s crew can incorporate one or more of the following upgrades to a weapon by multiplying the weapon’s BP cost by the listed value. Any restrictions on the types of weapons to which an upgrade can be applied are listed in the upgrade’s entry.</p><p><strong>TABLE 1–2: WEAPON UPGRADE COSTS</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>SPECIAL PROPERTY</p></td><td><p>BP COST MULTIPLIER</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#array]{Array}</p></td><td><p>x1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#automated]{Automated}</p></td><td><p>x1.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#deployed]{Deployed}</p></td><td><p>x2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#line]{Line}</p></td><td><p>x1.75</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#mystical]{Mystical}</p></td><td><p>x1.25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.1hTMc6MfkFkE54NK.JournalEntryPage.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#smart]{Smart}</p></td><td><p>x1.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source</strong>: SOM, pp. 22-23</p><p>Like handheld gear, starship weapons and systems can be made wholly or in part from special materials. Pricey starmetals often imbue starships with extraordinary capabilities rarely matched by synthetic materials—from the heat-dissipating properties of siccatite to the magic-absorption of noqual. Specialized outfitters are always happy to install these premier components, giving starfarers an edge as they brave the galaxy’s greatest dangers.</p><p></p><p>Each major component of a starship—its armor, defensive countermeasures, power core, sensors, thrusters, and individual weapon mounts—can be constructed using only one special material, though each of a starship’s weapon mounts can use a different special material and counts as a separate system for this purpose. When purchasing a starship component, you can spend additional BP as shown on Table 1–8 (page 23) to purchase a version of that component made from a compatible special material.</p><h2>ABYSIUM</h2><p>A highly radioactive metal with a bluish-green glow, abysium provides exceptional conductivity and can store electric charges far more efficiently than more mundane metals such as copper.</p><p><strong>Power Core</strong>: A properly functioning abysium reactor produces far less waste than reactors that use other radioactive materials and doesn’t require extreme pressure to sustain nuclear reactions, but it’s hazardous when ruptured. An abysium power core increases the PCU it provides by 25% (maximum +50 PCU). However, if the power core takes critical damage, the starship’s occupants are subjected to radiation for 1 round of starship combat. This radiation is low if the power core gains the glitching condition, medium if it gains the malfunctioning condition, and high if it gains the wrecked condition.</p><p><strong>Weapon Mount</strong>: Abysium is naturally radioactive. An abysium weapon mount grants any weapon installed onto it the irradiate special property, with a light weapon mount creating low radiation, a heavy mount creating moderate radiation, and a capital or spinal mount creating heavy radiation. If the weapon already has the irradiate special property, add 1 round to the duration of any radiation applied to struck starships. Mounting a light, heavy, capital, or spinal weapon with abysium increases its cost by 2 BP, 6 BP, 10 BP, or 10 BP, respectively.</p><h2>ADAMANTINE ALLOY</h2><p>Famously strong, pure adamantine is too expensive to incorporate into something as large as a starship, but its alloys can impart some of the metal’s infamous deadliness and impregnability.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Adamantine alloy armor protects a starship against all but the strongest attacks. This armor grants the starship a Damage Threshold equal to the armor’s bonus to AC, stacking with the starship’s existing Damage Threshold. Adamantine alloy increases a starship’s size category by 1 for the purpose of calculating the cost of its armor; the value of a Supercolossal ship’s size category increases from 8 to 9 for this purpose.</p><p>See @UUID[.PwTzJZqr9NLiruSn#fortified-hull]{Fortified Hull} (page 21) for denser adamantine armor.</p><p><strong>Weapon Mount</strong>: Adamantine alloy weapons are extraordinarily destructive, capable of tearing apart unprotected targets. When such a weapon strikes a target in a quadrant without functioning shields, it deals +1 damage per damage die to the target. Against a starship with functioning deflector shields (page 20), an adamantine alloy weapon reduces that quadrant’s defense value by an additional 1 for each hit that reduces the target’s Hull Points; this stacks with the effects of weapon special properties such as array, line, and ripper.</p><p>Mounting an adamantine alloy weapon increases its BP cost by an amount equal to half the weapon’s damage dice. If a weapon’s damage is multiplied, multiply the cost increase by an equal amount.</p><h2>DJEZET</h2><p>This rust-colored, liquid starmetal guides magical energies much as copper guides electricity in a circuit. While it offers little benefit to a starship’s frame, its unique properties can enhance a starship’s sensors and improve its power efficiency.</p><p><strong>Power Core</strong>: A djezet power core absorbs trace magical energies and directs those toward powering minor systems, seeming to produce energy from nowhere. A djezet power core increases the PCU it provides by 10% (maximum +20 PCU), but it can direct that power only to fulfill the PCU requirements for expansion bays.</p><p><strong>Sensors</strong>: Djezet-infused sensors can analyze supernatural auras and unseen magical currents, providing a more comprehensive view of a starship’s surroundings. Djezet sensors increase their range by 50%: short-range, medium-range, and long-range djezet sensors have ranges of 7 hexes, 15 hexes, and 30 hexes, respectively. Additionally, djezet sensors typically have a range of 375 feet on most planets, instead of 250 feet, though obstructions such as terrain might limit this range.</p><h2>HORACALCUM</h2><p>The rarest of star metals, horacalcum is a dull, orange-brown metal with the potent ability to warp space-time around itself.</p><p><strong>Defensive Countermeasures</strong>: A horacalcum lattice incorporated into a starship’s defensive countermeasures creates a field of space-time fluctuation that slows larger incoming projectiles. The speed of any tracking weapon fired at the starship is reduced by 25% (round down the final speed).</p><p><strong>Thrusters</strong>: By bending space around a vessel in subtle ways, horacalcum thrusters propel a starship at incredible speeds and enable improbable maneuvers. Horacalcum increases the maximum speed of any thrusters by 1 and reduces a starship’s Piloting check penalty based on its maximum speed by 1 (minimum +0). Active horacalcum thrusters glow with a telltale orange hue.</p><h2>INUBRIX</h2><p>Nicknamed “ghost iron” due to its ability to phase through denser materials, inubrix is a soft metal typically alloyed with platinum before being incorporated into a starship’s systems.</p><p><strong>Thrusters</strong>: Leaving ephemeral, smoky contrails, inubrix thrusters allow parts of a starship to phase through physical matter for crucial seconds, turning glancing blows into near misses. The starship’s pilot gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Piloting checks to avoid hazards, and damage dealt to the starship by hazards is reduced by an amount equal to its tier.</p><p><strong>Weapon Mount</strong>: An inubrix alloy weapon’s payload phases in and out of reality, potentially bypassing armor and interior bulwarks to inflict extraordinary damage to a target’s inner systems. Whenever an inubrix alloy weapon scores critical damage against a starship, it has a 20% chance to critically damage the randomly determined system twice. For example, it might cause an undamaged system to gain the malfunctioning condition rather than the glitching condition.</p><p>Inubrix weapons provide no additional benefit against biomechanical starships and starship-scale creatures. Mounting a light, heavy, capital, or spinal weapon with inubrix increases its cost by 2 BP, 6 BP, 10 BP, or 10 BP, respectively.</p><h2>NOQUAL</h2><p>This green, lightweight crystalline starmetal is best known for its magic-dampening properties. Incorporating noqual into starships is a delicate process, as improperly installed noqual impairs that vessel’s magitech operations as often as it stymies enemy ships.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Noqual armor deflects magical attacks and absorbs ambient magic, complicating the actions of spellcasting officers on board. Treat the starship’s tier as 2 higher when determining the Mysticism DC of magic officer actions that use the armored starship’s tier to calculate the DC of Mysticism checks. Additionally, the starship’s AC and TL increase by 2 against weapons with the mystical special property (page 15).</p><p><strong>Sensors</strong>: The scanning pulses emitted by a noqual-augmented sensor array can interfere with enemy diagnostics, particularly the functions of any magitech components. When a science officer uses the scan crew action and exceeds the check DC by 5 or more, they can choose to learn only one piece of information and instead scramble the other ship’s sensors, giving the sensors the glitching condition for 1 round for every 5 by which the Computers check exceeded the scan action’s DC.</p><h2>SICCATITE</h2><p>Siccatite is a silvery starmetal renowned for its extreme resiliency to thermal energy. Capable of acting either as “cold” siccatite or “hot” siccatite, trace quantities of this material commonly reinforce and absorb heat from starship power cores and thrusters.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Siccatite armor has the unique ability to absorb massive amounts of heat, allowing the metal to withstand friction better than nearly any other material. When a starship with siccatite armor moves through an atmosphere (page 52), it treats the current friction level as if it were one level less severe when determining the amount of damage the starship sustains (severe becomes high, high becomes moderate, moderate becomes low, and low becomes none).</p><p><strong>Defensive Countermeasures</strong>: By wrapping key portions of a starship in an insulated mesh of siccatite, the extremely hot or frigid metal can obscure the vessel’s systems against enemy sensors. Treat a starship with siccatite defensive countermeasures as 2 tiers higher when determining the Computers DC of science officer actions that use the protected starship’s tier to calculate the DC of Computers checks.</p><p></p><p><strong>TABLE 1–8: SPECIAL MATERIALS</strong></p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><p>UPGRADED SYSTEM</p></td><td><p>BP COST</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>ABYSIUM</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Power core</p></td><td><p>+2 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weapon mount</p></td><td><p>Special</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>ADAMANTINE ALLOY</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Armor</p></td><td><p>Special</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weapon mount</p></td><td><p>Special</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>DJEZET</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Power core</p></td><td><p>+1 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sensors</p></td><td><p>+3 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>HORACALCUM</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Defensive countermeasures</p></td><td><p>+4 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Thrusters</p></td><td><p>+2 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>INUBRIX</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Thrusters</p></td><td><p>+1 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weapon mount</p></td><td><p>Special</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>NOQUAL</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Armor</p></td><td><p>+4 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sensors</p></td><td><p>+2 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>SICCATITE</strong></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Armor</p></td><td><p>+2 BP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Defensive countermeasures</p></td><td><p>+3 BP</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",
