The number you gain is determined by the class chosen for that level (as noted on the chart below), adjusted by your Intelligence modifier (though you always gain a minimum of 1 skill rank per level). For instance, if you create a 1st-level technomancer with an Intelligence score of 18, you gain 8 skill ranks per level: 4 ranks from the technomancer class and 4 more ranks because your Intelligence modifier is +4.</p><p>Investing a rank in a skill represents training gained through experience or intense study. Each skill rank increases your total skill bonus by 1 (see Skill Checks below)—as you level up, you can invest new ranks to upgrade existing skills or learn new ones. Your skill ranks in a single skill can’t exceed your character level. Skills in which you’ve invested ranks are called trained skills; skills in which you have no ranks are untrained skills.</p><p>Each class also features a number of favored skills, called class skills (see Table 5–1 on page 134). It’s easier for you to become proficient in your class skills. Class skills in which you have at least 1 rank are known as trained class skills; you gain a +3 bonus to skill checks with such skills. If you have more than one class, you gain the class skills from all your classes.

        "content": "<p><strong>Source</strong>: CRB pg. 132</p><p>No matter how skilled you become, when using skills, success is rarely certain. To determine whether you succeed when using a skill, you attempt a skill check: roll 1d20 and add your total skill bonus to the roll. Your total skill bonus includes the following.</p><ul><li>Skill Ranks: Each skill rank you’ve invested in the skill increases your total skill bonus by 1.</li><li>Trained Class Skill Bonus: If the skill is a trained class skill for you, you gain a +3 bonus.</li><li>Associated Ability Score Modifier: Each skill has an associated ability score modifier listed in its entry; add this modifier to your total skill bonus.</li><li>Other Modifiers: Sometimes your race, your feats, items you are using, spells affecting you, or other mitigating circumstances confer additional bonuses or penalties. For instance, any skill with “armor check penalty” listed in its heading is harder to use effectively while wearing bulky armor, and you apply an armor check penalty (see page 196) to all skill checks of that type while wearing such armor.</li></ul><p>The total of 1d20 + your total skill bonus is referred to as the result of your skill check. If the result of your skill check equals or exceeds the difficulty class (also called the DC) of the task you are attempting, you succeed. If the total is less than the DC, you fail. Sometimes a task features varying degrees of success or failure depending on how much your result is above or below the required DC. The GM is responsible for determining the DCs of skill checks (see Skill DCs on page 392 for more details).</p><p>Often, using a skill requires taking an action, or it is taken as part of some other action. The action depends on the skill and the specific task listed in that skill. Each skill description details a number of common tasks for which that skill is used. Your GM will also prompt you to roll nonstandard skill checks when the circumstances of the game demand it.</p><p>Sometimes you attempt a skill check not to accomplish a task, but to thwart someone else’s task or action. This is called an opposed skill check. With an opposed skill check, one creature attempts a skill check to try accomplish some action or task, while another creature attempts its own skill check to determine the DC the first creature must meet or exceed to accomplish its goal. Typically, attempting an opposed skill check to determine the DC requires no action, but it often requires you to be conscious or have the ability to take certain types of actions when you do so.<br />On occasion, it’s impossible for you to attempt a skill check. Sometimes the situation prevents you from rolling a skill check, and other times the skill in question requires special training in order to attempt. Skills that require special training are called trained-only skills and are marked as such in their headings. Unless otherwise noted in the skill’s description, you can’t attempt an untrained skill check to accomplish a task using a trained-only skill; you must have at least 1 rank in that skill to attempt a check.</p><p>The table that begins the following page summarizes the differences between trained and untrained skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>SKILL CHECK TYPE</td><td>SKILL CHECK RESULT</td></tr><tr><td>Trained class skill</td><td><p>1d20 + skill ranks + 3 + ability score<br />modifier + other modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td>Trained skill</td><td><p>1d20 + skill ranks + ability score modifier<br />+ other modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td>Untrained skill</td><td><p>1d20 + ability score modifier + other<br />modifiers*</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>* Armor check penalties apply to most Strength- and Dexterity-based<br />skill checks.</p></td><th></th></tr></tbody></table><h2>Take 10</h2><p>Most of the time, you attempt skill checks while under pressure or during times of great stress. Other times, the situation is more favorable, making success more certain.</p><p>When you are not in immediate danger or distracted, the GM might allow you to take 10 on a skill check. When you take 10, you don’t roll a d20, but rather assume that you rolled a 10 on that die, then add the relevant skill modifiers. For many routine tasks, or for tasks you are particularly skilled at, taking 10 ensures success. If you still fail when taking 10, you might require more time and energy to succeed at that task (see Take 20 below).</p><p>Unless you have an ability that states otherwise, you cannot take 10 during a combat encounter. Also, you can’t take 10 when the GM rules that a situation is too hectic or that you are distracted, and taking 10 is almost never an option for a check that requires some sort of crucial effect as a key part of the adventure's story.</p><h2>Take 20</h2><p>When you have plenty of time to devote to a skill’s task and that task has no adverse effect upon failure, the GM might rule that you can take 20 on that skill check. This is similar to taking 10, but instead of assuming your roll was a 10, you assume it’s a 20.</p><p>Taking 20 means you are making multiple attempts at the task until you get it right. It also assumes that you are failing many times before you succeed. Taking 20 typically takes 20 times as long as attempting a single check would take (usually 2 minutes for a skill that takes a standard action to perform).</p><h2>Aid Another</h2><p>The GM might rule that you can help someone succeed at a skill check by performing the same action and attempting a skill check as part of a cooperative effort. To do so, you must attempt your skill check before the creature you want to help, and if you succeed at a DC 10 check, that creature gains a +2 bonus to his check, as long as he attempts the check before the end of his next turn. At the GM’s discretion, only a limited number of creatures might be able to aid another. You cannot take 10 or take 20 on an aid another check, but you can use aid another to help a creature who is taking 10 or 20 on a check.</p>",

The DCs for such checks are based on the current wind and air conditions and other factors determined by the GM. You can’t take 20 on Acrobatics checks to fly.</p><h3>Avoid Falling Damage</h3><ul><li> If you are falling and you can fly, you can attempt an Acrobatics check as a reaction to negate the damage from the fall. If you fail, you fall normally. If you have perfect maneuverability, you can avoid falling damage automatically without attempting a check.</li></ul><h3>Fly in Dangerous Wind Condition</h3><ul><li>The more violent the wind conditions, the more difficult it is to keep flying. In conditions of windstorm or higher (51+ mph; see page 400), you must attempt an Acrobatics check to stay aloft each time you move. If you fail this check, you cannot move. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you are blown 2d6 × 10 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind (or in a direction decided by the GM), and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. You can’t take 10 on Acrobatics checks to fly in dangerous wind conditions.</li></ul><h3>Hover</h3><ul><li>Safe flight typically requires momentum. If you wish to stay in place, or hover, while flying, you must attempt an Acrobatics check as a move action. If you fail, you fall. If you have clumsy maneuverability, you can’t hover at all. If you have average maneuverability and at least 5 ranks in Acrobatics or if you have perfect maneuverability, you can hover automatically without attempting a check; this does not require a move action.</li></ul><p>The DCs for Acrobatics checks to fly are based on the prevailing wind conditions. The following chart provides the base DCs for air conditions, whether an Acrobatics check is required to fly in those air conditions, and whether a creature can take 10 on an Acrobatics check to fly. These wind conditions typically represent fairly clear skies and consistent wind speeds. The DC increases by as much as 5 for choppy wind or airborne debris, or 10 for both.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>WIND<br />CONDITIONS</p></td><td style=\"width:20%\">DC</td><td><p>CHECK<br />REQUIRED?</p></td><td>TAKE 10?</td></tr><tr><td>Light to moderate (0–20 mph)</td><td>15</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Strong (21–30 mph)</td><td>17</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Severe (31–50 mph)</td><td>19</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Windstorm (51–74 mph)</td><td>27</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Hurricane force (75–174 mph)</td><td>33</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Tornado force (175+ mph)</td><td>39</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Tumble</h2><p>As long as you do not have the encumbered or overburdened condition (see pages 275–276), you can use Acrobatics to move through a space threatened by an enemy or enemies without provoking attacks of opportunity from them. Tumbling is a move action, and you move at half speed. The DC to move through an opponent’s threatened area is 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If multiple opponents are threatening the same space, you attempt one check with a DC based on the opponent with the highest CR, and the DC increases by 2 for each additional opponent beyond the first.<br />You can also tumble directly through an opponent’s space; the DC is 20 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR. If you fail this check, you stop moving adjacent to your opponent and provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If you attempt to move through multiple threatened spaces or opponents’ spaces during the same round, you must succeed at a check for each space, and the DC of each check beyond the first increases by 2. For example, if you tumble through a space threatened by two CR 1 creatures and a CR 2 creature, the DC = 15 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 22. If you then tumble through the space of the CR 2 creature, the DC = 20 + 3 + 2 = 25.</p><p>In all of these cases, the DC is modified by the same environmental circumstances that apply to the balance task of Acrobatics (see page 135). If you fail the check, you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. If you want to move at full speed while tumbling, you take a –10 penalty to the check. You can use Acrobatics to tumble while prone, but you can move only 5 feet as a full action and take a –5 penalty to the check. Use the following base DCs for Acrobatics checks to tumble.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>SITUATION</td><td style=\"width:40%\">DC*</td></tr><tr><td>Move through a threatened area</td><td>15 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td></tr><tr><td>Move through an enemy’s space</td><td>20 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR</td></tr><tr><td><p>* The DC increases by 2 for each additional threatened space or<br />opponent’s space you move through in 1 round</p></td><th></th></tr></tbody></table>",

If you do not take a running start, the DC of the check doubles. The DC is modified by the same environmental circumstances that apply to Acrobatics checks to balance (see page 135). If you fail the check, you fall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall prone even if you don’t take any damage from the fall. Creatures with a land speed of 35 feet or more gain a +4 bonus to Athletics checks to jump. This bonus increases by 4 for every 10 by which a creature's land speed exceeds 40 feet.

If you fail by 5 or more, you sink beneath the surface or sink deeper, and you must hold your breath or begin drowning (see page 404).

Your Bluff check is opposed by the Sense Motive check of the creature you are attempting to beguile. If you succeed, you can either attempt the hide task of Stealth as if you had cover or concealment, or you gain a +10 bonus to perform the palm an object task of Sleight of Hand (your choice). Occasionally, your Bluff check might be opposed by several creatures (for instance, if you are on a crowded space station promenade); in such cases, the GM might decide to roll several Sense Motive checks, and you succeed only against creatures with Sense Motive results lower than your Bluff result.</p><h2>Feint</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Bluff to feint in combat, enabling you to treat your opponent as flat-footed for your next attack against it before the end of your next turn. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. You can’t feint against a creature that doesn’t have an Intelligence score, and you cannot take 10 or take 20 on a Bluff check to feint.</p><h2>Lie</h2><p>You can use Bluff to deceive someone or tell a convincing lie. A quick, simple lie in combat is part of combat banter; otherwise, telling a lie is at least a full action, but it can take longer if the lie is elaborate, as determined by the GM. If the creature is suspicious or attending carefully to your lie (as per the detect deception task for Sense Motive), the check is opposed by the Sense Motive check of the creature you are lying to; otherwise, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the creature’s total Sense Motive skill bonus. If you succeed, the creature you are lying to believes you are telling the truth, at least until confronted with evidence to the contrary. The GM may determine that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince someone they are true.</p><p>The DCs for Bluff checks to lie are adjusted based on the target’s initial attitude toward you (see Diplomacy on page 139) as well as other circumstances determined by the GM (such as the plausibility of the lie).<br /></p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Initial Attitude</strong></td><td><strong>DC Modifier</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hostile</strong></td><td><strong>+10</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Unfriendly</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Indifferent</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>Helpful</td><td>–5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Pass Secret Message</h2><p>You can use Bluff to pass a secret message to an ally without others understanding the message’s true meaning. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for more complex messages, as determined by the GM. Those overhearing the message can attempt an opposed Sense Motive check to learn the gist of the message. You cannot take 20 on a Bluff check to pass a secret message.</p>",

If you don’t have physical access to a computer system’s user interface, you must use a hacking kit to access and manipulate the system. Details of computers themselves begin on page 213.</p><p>Computers are set up to give one or more authorized users “root access,” allowing them to access any information or function of the computer as a standard action, with no need for a Computers check. Firewalls can block off specific sections of a computer and grant different users root access to those sections.</p><p>The base DC for many of the tasks of the Computers skill is equal to 13 + (4 × the computer’s tier). These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.</p><h2>Access Unsecured System</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Computers to access an unsecured computer system’s most basic functions. The DC to access the information or functions of a public computer with no countermeasures or firewalls is generally 10. Unlike other tasks of the Computers skill, you can attempt to access a system untrained if you take 20 on the task, requiring 2 minutes. Secured computer systems, and secured sections of an unsecured system, can be accessed by making a Computers check to hack a system.</p><h2>Craft Computer</h2><p>If you have enough ranks in Computers, you can build computers. See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p><h2>Create or Detect Forgery</h2><p>You can use Computers to forge official documents. This takes 1d4 minutes. The GM rolls the Computers check to create a forgery in secret, so you’re not sure how good your forgery is. This check is opposed by the Computers check of anyone who examines the document to determine its authenticity.</p><p>The DCs for Computers checks to detect a forgery are based on the type of forged document as well as other circumstances determined by the GM, as shown in the table below.<br /></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Circumstance</td><td>DC Modifier</td></tr><tr><td>Document contradicts knowledge or orders</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Type of document is well known to examiner</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Type of document is unknown to examiner</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Examiner only casually reviews document</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Forger has a sample of a similar document</td><td>+8</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Destroy or Repair System or Module</h2><p>You can use Computers to repair a computer system or module that has been disabled, or destroy one that has been either removed or disabled by spending 10 minutes per tier of the computer system working on the computer. The DC is based on the tier of the computer system. If you are repairing a disabled module or system and you fail the check by 5 or more, you accidentally destroy the module or system. You can’t take 20 on a Computers check to destroy or repair a computer system.</p><h2>Detect Fake Shell</h2><p>If you have access to a computer, but not root access, you may actually only have access to a fake shell (see page 217). If you succeed at the check, which takes a full action, you realize that you have accessed a fake shell. The DC is equal to the DC to hack the computer + 5 (see Table 7–22: Computer Tiers on page 214).</p><h2>Disable or Manipulate Module</h2><p>A character with root access to a computer can disable or manipulate a countermeasure or module as a standard action with a DC 10 Computers check. If you have access (but not root access) to a computer, you can attempt a Computers check to activate, add, disable, or manipulate any countermeasure or module. If you want to affect a countermeasure or module that is behind a firewall, you must first hack the system (see below) to gain access to it. Activating or disabling a countermeasure or module generally takes a standard action. Adding or removing a module generally takes 1 minute per tier of the computer. All of these tasks have a DC equal to the DC to hack the system. You cannot take 20 on a Computers check to disable or manipulate a module.</p><h2>Gain Root Access</h2><p>If you have access to a computer, you can attempt to upgrade your authorization to gain root access. This works similar to hacking the same computer, but the DC is 20 higher. In many cases it is impossible to gain root access, and every task beyond the computer’s basic functions must be attempted as a separate check to destroy, repair, disable, or manipulate modules or countermeasures. If a firewall has been set to have a different set of authorized users with root access, you must gain root access to it separately. Once you have root access to a computer, you can alter who else is granted root access with a successful Computers check to hack the system.</p><h2>Hack System</h2><p>You can use Computers to hack a computer system to which you don’t already have access. Hacking a computer system typically takes one full action per tier of the computer system. You can cut this time in half (to a minimum of one full action) for every 5 by which you increase the DC of the Computers check. If you succeed at the check, you gain access to any part of the computer that is not behind a firewall (see page 217). This allows you to use the basic functions of the computer and to make further checks that require you to have access. Accessing parts of a computer behind a firewall requires an additional Computers check for each firewall.</p>",

Attitudes fall into five categories (from worst to best): hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful. You can use Diplomacy to change a creature’s initial attitude to a more positive one, but at the risk of angering the creature and worsening its attitude toward you if you fail. This is a language-dependent ability. The creature must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher, and you must spend at least 1 minute interacting and conversing with the creature to change its attitude. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Diplomacy skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR (or the encounter’s CR, if you are trying to change the attitude of a group of creatures), whichever is higher. The DC is modified by the creature’s initial attitude (see page 140) and other circumstances, as determined by the GM. If you succeed, the creature’s attitude improves by one category (for instance, a hostile creature becomes unfriendly). If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you can choose to spend 10 more minutes interacting with the creature to improve its attitude by one additional category. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you anger the creature, and the creature’s attitude worsens by one category (for instance, a friendly creature becomes indifferent).</p><p>Attacking a creature always worsens its attitude by one category for each attack made, and may have other consequences based on the creature’s current attitude.</p><p>Positively affecting a creature’s attitude takes time. You typically can't use Diplomacy to positively change a creature’s attitude by more than one category (or two categories if you spend the extra time) within a 24-hour period, unless the GM decides otherwise or you have an ability that allows you to do so.</p><p>The five categories of initial attitude are described below, along with the effects of negatively changing each attitude.</p><h4>HOSTILE</h4><p>A hostile creature would rather attack you either physically or verbally, than civilly converse with you. Most enemies you meet are hostile. It’s often hard to talk diplomatically with hostile creatures, though it can be done remotely (via a communication device) or by avoiding combat with the creatures while persuading them to listen to reason. If you fail the Diplomacy check by 5 or more, you can’t attempt to change a hostile creature’s attitude again for 24 hours.</p><hr /><h4>UNFRIENDLY</h4><p>Unfriendly creatures are typically wary of you, or afraid you will try to hurt them if they aren’t careful or fail to keep you at bay. Unfriendly creatures become hostile when angered or attacked.</p><hr /><h4>INDIFFERENT</h4><p>Indifferent creatures take little notice of you, but hold no ill will against you. They don’t care about your plight, but may give you simple advice or directions. Most creatures you meet in everyday life or in settlements are indifferent. Indifferent creatures become unfriendly when angered or attacked.</p><hr /><h4>FRIENDLY</h4><p>Either due to a generally cheerful disposition or a predisposition to like you, friendly creatures treat you with kindness and respect. They may give you more-detailed advice or simple aid, but generally won’t go out of their way to be helpful.

This check is opposed by the Perception check (see page 144) of anyone who might realize that you are not who you appear to be. If you are not drawing attention to yourself, other creatures do not usually get to attempt a Perception check to pierce your disguise.

If you don’t have an engineering kit when attempting an Engineering check, you take a –2 penalty to the check.</p><h2>Arm Explosives</h2><p>You can use Engineering to arm an explosive using a detonator (see page 218). This takes 1 minute to connect the detonator and set the explosive. The DC of this check is typically 10. If you fail the check, you can attempt to arm the explosive again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you trigger the explosive prematurely.</p><p>You can also attempt to build an explosive more difficult to disarm. To do so, choose a target disarm DC (the DC should be in an increment of 5, with a minimum DC of 15). This DC becomes your target DC to arm the explosive as well as the DC to disarm the explosive (see Disable Device below).</p><h2>Assess Stability</h2><p>You can use Engineering to assess a structure or a piece of machinery to determine its stability, usability, and structural weak points. This takes 1 minute or more, and the DC is determined by the GM.</p><p>Use the following base DCs for Engineering checks to assess stability.

To do so, you must be within 30 feet of the structure and able to perceive it with a precise sense, or you must have access to detailed schematics. The base DC of this check is 15, modified by any circumstances such as the structure’s complexity or structure. If you succeed, you determine one of the following statistics, plus an additional statistic for every 5 by which you exceed the DC: the structure’s break DC, its hardness, or its Hit Points. If you fail the check, you can retry it after 24 hours.</p><h2>Craft Tech Item</h2><p>If you have enough ranks in Engineering, you can create technological devices or items (including computers). See page 235 for the crafting rules.</p><h2>Disable Device</h2><p>You can use Engineering to disable a lock, a trap, or a mechanical or technological device, or to disarm an explosive, as long as the device is unattended and you can access it. The amount of time this takes depends on the complexity of the device but typically requires at least one full action. The DC of the check is determined by the GM and is based on the complexity of the device. For extremely complex devices or systems, the GM might require multiple checks. The GM rolls the Engineering check to disable a device in secret, so you don’t necessarily know whether your attempt has succeeded or failed. If you succeed, you disable the device. If you fail the check and discover your error, you can attempt to disable the device again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is an explosive or a trap, you trigger it. If you are attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p><p>You can also use the disable device task to rig a device to work normally for a while, and then become disabled sometime later. This increases the DC of the check by 5. If you want to leave no trace of your tampering, the DC increases by an additional 5. If you succeed at the check, you can rig the device to become disabled up to 1 round later for each rank of Engineering you have. If you fail the check by 5 or more, your efforts have the same effect as if you were merely attempting to disable the device.</p><p>Due to the danger, you cannot take 20 on an Engineering check to disable a device.</p><p>The DC for an Engineering check to disable a device is based on the complexity of the device. The following chart provides base DCs by complexity, examples of such devices, and the time it takes to disable such devices. The GM can adjust these DCs and times to reflect other circumstances.

Generally, a check is not required to identify relatively simple technological items that are commonly available in the Pact Worlds (such as those items presented in Chapter 7).

The amount of time this takes typically depends on the complexity of the object. You can repair an object or piece of equipment you crafted in half the usual time. The DC of the check is determined by the GM and based on the complexity of the object. If you succeed, you restore a number of Hit Points equal to the result of your Engineering check. If you fail the check by 10 or more, you damage the object further, dealing 1d4 damage to it; this damage can’t reduce an item to fewer than 1 HP.</p><p>If the object or piece of equipment is damaged but not broken, you can repair it at no cost. If it is broken but not destroyed, you must spend 10 UPBs per item level (see page 233; assume a simple item has an item level of 1) each time you attempt to repair it.

You can also search an area to find anything of interest that might be hidden or is otherwise not immediately noticeable, such as concealed cargo compartments or hidden treasure. In that case, it takes 1 minute to search an area no more than 20 feet by 20 feet (or smaller, if the GM rules the area is particularly cluttered or complex). The DC is determined by the Stealth check of the creature, by the trap or hazard involved, or by the GM. If you are not in combat, you can take 20 on a Perception check to search.<br />The DCs for Perception checks to search may be adjusted by the GM based on the circumstances and to reflect other conditions. The following chart provides some example circumstances and their typical DCs.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>CIRCUMSTANCE</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Hear the sound of battle</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Detect a strong smell</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hear the details of a conversation</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Notice a creature in plain sight</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Determine whether food is spoiled</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Hear the sound of a Small or Medium creature walking</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Hear the details of a whispered conversation</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Find a typical unmarked cargo hatch</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hear the sound of an automatic door opening</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Find a typical secret compartment</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Hear a pistol being drawn</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Sense a creature burrowing 5 feet below you</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Notice someone picking your pocket</td><td>Opposed by Sleight of Hand</td></tr><tr><td>Notice a creature using Stealth</td><td>Opposed by Stealth</td></tr><tr><td>Find a hidden trap</td><td>Varies by trap</td></tr></tbody></table>",

This lets you direct your vehicle or ship in your desired heading and to plot longer courses. Plotting a course to a star system you have visited frequently usually requires a successful DC 10 Piloting check and takes 10 minutes. Plotting a course to a less familiar star system is more difficult and requires information about the destination system; navigation is also more difficult if you are currently lost.</p><p>If you fail the check to chart a course between star systems by 9 or less, you realize that you have plotted a faulty course and must attempt the check again before you can make the journey. If you fail the check by 10 or more, you aren’t aware that your calculations are erroneous, and it takes longer than normal for you to reach your destination (usually 1d6 additional days for Drift travel). At the GM’s discretion, you might instead arrive in an unfamiliar star system (plotting a course from there to your actual destination usually requires a successful DC 25 Piloting check), or when you arrive at your intended destination, your starship’s engines may have gained the glitching critical damage condition (see page 321).</p><p>Your familiarity with a region of space or a planet determines the DC of Piloting checks to navigate or astrogate. The GM can modify these DCs (usually by 5 to 10) based on the amount of information available about your starting location and destination, and whether the location is particularly difficult to navigate (such as a trackless desert or a strange nebula).</p><table><tbody><tr><th>FAMILIARITY</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Frequently visited or home base</td><td style=\"width:20%\">10</td></tr><tr><td>Seldom visited</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Unfamiliar</td><td>25</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Pilot a Starship</h2><p>If you take the pilot role in starship combat, you use your Piloting skill to maneuver, attempt stunts, and otherwise fly the starship.

You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession’s daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p><p>Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks. While skills like Culture, Life Science, Mysticism, and Physical Science represent highly specialized fields of study, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. When you put ranks in a Profession skill, you must choose the ability score keyed to that skill: Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. Common Charisma-based Profession skills include actor, artist, comedian, con artist, courtesan, dancer, musician, orator, poet, politician, video personality, and writer. Common Intelligence-based Profession skills include accountant, archaeologist, architect, corporate professional, electrician, lab technician, lawyer, mathematician, philosopher, professor, psychologist, and vidgamer. Common Wisdom-based Profession skills include bounty hunter, cook, counselor, dockworker, farmer, gambler, general contractor, herbalist, maintenance worker, manager, mercenary, merchant, miner, and smuggler.</p><p>A Profession skill should not overlap with existing skills. For example, if you want to play a scientist, you should put ranks into Life Science or Physical Science rather than create a Profession (scientist) skill. The GM is the final arbiter of what is a good choice for a Profession skill and what ability score a given Profession skill is keyed to.</p><p>Different professions are considered different skills for the purpose of how many ranks you can have each level. For example, a 4th-level character could have 4 ranks in both Profession (dockworker) and Profession (vidgamer).</p><h2>Earn a Living</h2><p>You can use Profession to earn money. A single check generally represents a week of work, and you earn a number of credits equal to double your Profession skill check result. At the GM’s discretion, you can use other skills (such as Computers or Engineering) to earn a living following the same guidelines.</p><h2>Recall Knowledge</h2><p>You can use Profession to recall knowledge about your profession and related topics (see page 133).</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 146</p><p>You can detect falsehoods and gain glimpses of the true intentions of creatures with which you interact.</p><h2>Detect Deception</h2><p>You can use Sense Motive to determine whether something just said to you was a deception or lie. At any time, if you doubt something another creature is telling you, you can request the GM to allow you to attempt a Sense Motive check to determine whether it is deceiving you. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter; otherwise, it’s a move action. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by that creature’s Bluff check. If you succeed, you realize that you are being deceived or that a lie is being told, but not how it is untrue, nor does it let you know the truth. If you fail (or if no deception or lie is being made), you believe that the speaker doesn’t seem to be deceiving you. Failing the check by 5 or more may mean (at the GM’s discretion) you believe that a truthful statement contains deceptions or that a lie or deception is a truthful statement.</p><h2>Discern Secret Message</h2><p>If you overhear or otherwise intercept a secret message, you can use Sense Motive to learn the gist of its true meaning. Doing so in combat is part of combat banter. Your Sense Motive check is opposed by a Bluff check attempted by the creature passing the secret message. If you succeed, you learn the information contained in the secret message. If you fail (or if there is no secret message), you don’t detect any hidden meaning in the message. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you might infer false information, as determined by the GM. Often, the GM rolls these checks in secret and informs you of the results.</p><h2>Sense Mental Effect</h2><p>You can use Sense Motive to ascertain whether another creature within 30 feet is affected by a mental effect, even if the creature is unaware of the effect. You must spend at least 1 minute interacting with the creature. The DC of this check is typically 25, but it can be higher or lower based on how overt the manifestation of the mental effect is, as determined by the GM. Knowing that a creature is under a mental effect does not automatically determine the nature of the mental effect, though outward signs and the subtleties of behavioral change may provide enough clues to attempt an Intelligence-based skill check or an Intelligence check to determine the nature of the mental effect, at the GM’s discretion.</p>",

The check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone observing you or searching your body. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus to the check. Especially small objects or those created to be easy to hide can grant up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your Sleight of Hand check to hide an object on your person, as can compartments in clothing or armor made to facilitate such hiding. Retrieving a weapon or object hidden on your person is a standard action.</p><h2>Palm Object</h2><p>As a standard action, you can use Sleight of Hand to palm a small object no larger than a small communicator or memory stick. The check is opposed by the Perception checks of anyone nearby who could notice the attempt. If you successfully use the Bluff skill to create a diversion, you gain a +10 bonus to this check (see Bluff on page 137).

You can attempt a Stealth check to hide either as a move action (if you are planning to stay immobile) or as part of a move action. If you move at a rate of half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Stealth check. If you attempt to hide while moving more than half your speed or after creating a diversion with Bluff, you take a –10 penalty to your Stealth check; these penalties are cumulative if you do both. The check is opposed by the Perception checks of creatures in the area that might detect you. A creature that fails the opposed skill check treats you as if you had total concealment as long as you continue to have actual cover or concealment. A creature that succeeds at the opposed skill check either sees you or pinpoints you (see page 260) in situations when you have total concealment. If you lose actual cover or concealment during your turn, you can attempt to stay hidden, but only if you end your turn within cover or concealment.</p><h3>Invisibility and Hiding</h3><p>If you are invisible or benefit from total concealment, you gain a +40 bonus to your Stealth check as long as you remain immobile. You are considered immobile if it is your turn and you have not yet moved or if you have not moved since the start of your last turn. If you are invisible but not immobile, you instead gain a +20 bonus to your Stealth check. Typically, a creature cannot attack you if you are invisible or have total concealment unless the creature pinpoints you with a successful Perception check. (Invisible creatures can still be heard, smelled, and felt, and might do something to make themselves known to those who succeed at Perception checks; see Invisible on page 264 in Chapter 8.) Even then, the attacking creature has a 50% miss chance against the pinpointed creature.</p><hr /><h3>Attacking From Hiding</h3><p>If you are successfully hiding from a creature, that creature is considered flat-footed for the purpose of your first attack from hiding. If you remain invisible after your first attack, that creature is considered flat-footed against your attacks until it succeeds at a Perception check to locate you or until you become visible.</p><h2>Sniping</h2><p>If you have already successfully used Stealth to hide from a creature that is at least 10 feet away, you can briefly pop out of cover or concealment and make a single ranged attack against that creature. As long as you can reenter cover or concealment, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide again as part of that attack with a –20 penalty.</p>",

These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>TASK</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Endure severe weather</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Handle an animal</td><td>10 + 1-1/2 × CR of animal</td></tr><tr><td>Live off the land</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Orienteering</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Predict weather</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Rear a wild animal</td><td>15 + 1-1/2 × CR of animal</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Endure Severe Weather</h2><p>You can use Survival to better withstand the effects of severe weather. Typically, one check determines the success of your efforts for a single day. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude saving throws against severe weather while moving up to half your overland speed, or a +4 bonus if you remain stationary and build a temporary shelter. You can grant this bonus to one other creature for every 1 point by which your result exceeds the DC. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to endure severe weather.</p><h2>Follow Tracks</h2><p>You can use Survival to either find tracks or follow tracks you have found for 1 mile or until they become difficult to follow, whichever occurs first. Finding tracks requires a full action. If you move at half your speed or less, you take no penalty to your Survival check. You can move at your full speed with a –5 penalty to the check or at twice your normal speed with a –20 penalty to the check.<br />The base DCs for Survival checks to follow tracks depend on the surface and are adjusted based on prevailing conditions and the group being tracked; such modifiers are cumulative. The GM may further adjust DCs to reflect other circumstances such as the number of creatures being tracked, local gravity, and weather conditions.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>SURFACE</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>Very soft ground (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud)</td><td style=\"width:20%\">5</td></tr><tr><td>Soft ground (soft earth, drying mud)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Firm ground (fields, woods, thick rugs, dirty or dusty floors)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hard ground (bare rock, most flooring)</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><th>CONDITION</th><th>DC MODIFIER</th></tr><tr><td>Multiple creatures in group being tracked</td><td>–1 per three creatures</td></tr><tr><td>Time since tracks were made</td><td>+1 per 24 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Moonlight</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Overcast or moonless night</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>Tracked group moves at half speed and hides trail</td><td>+5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Handle an Animal</h2><p>As a move action, you can use Survival to improve the attitude of an animal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. This functions just like a Diplomacy check to change a person’s initial attitude, but it is not language-dependent. A typical domesticated animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><h2>Live off the Land</h2><p>You can use Survival to keep yourself and others fed in the wild by hunting and foraging, enabling you to move up to half your overland speed without needing food and water supplies. Typically, one check determines the success of your efforts for a single day. You can provide food and water for one other character for every 2 points by which the result of your check exceeds 10. In some cases, an environment may be so inhospitable (such as an airless asteroid) that it is impossible to live off the land. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to live off the land.</p><h2>Orienteering</h2><p>Once each hour while traveling through unfamiliar terrain and each time you move close to a natural hazard such as quicksand or patches of poisonous atmosphere, you can use Survival to keep from getting lost or to notice or avoid the hazard.</p><h2>Predict Weather</h2><p>You can use Survival to predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. You must spend at least 1 minute observing the surrounding area and its current weather patterns. You can predict the weather an additional day in advance for every 5 points by which your result exceeds 15. You can’t take 20 on Survival checks to predict weather.</p><h2>Rear a Wild Animal (Trained Only)</h2><p>You can use Survival to raise a wild animal from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to use this task to rear wild creatures other than animals. Rearing a wild animal typically takes months or even years. If you succeed at the check at the end of this time, the animal is domesticated and has an initial attitude of friendly toward you. You can rear as many as three animals of the same kind at one time.</p><h2>Ride a Creature</h2><p>You can use Survival to ride an animal or another beast as a mount. The most typical actions while riding a creature don’t require checks. As a move action, you can either mount, ride (using the mount’s speed instead of yours), or dismount from a creature. Saddling a creature typically takes at least 1 minute, but the process could take longer if you’re using an unusual saddle or mount.<br />The following actions do require Survival checks.</p><h4>CONTROL MOUNT IN BATTLE</h4><p>You can attempt to control a mount not normally trained for combat while in battle. This is part of whatever action you are attempting to have the mount accomplish. If you fail the check, you lose that action.</p><hr /><h4>COVER</h4><p>As a swift action, you can drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail the check, you don’t gain the benefit of cover, and you can’t attack or cast until you use a move action to pull yourself back up. Pulling yourself back up doesn’t require a check.</p><hr /><h4>FAST MOUNT OR DISMOUNT</h4><p>You can attempt to mount or dismount from a creature as a swift action instead of a move action.</p><hr /><h4>FIGHT FROM A COMBAT-TRAINED MOUNT</h4><p>When you direct a mount trained for combat into battle, you must attempt a Survival check to ride as a swift action. If you succeed at the check, you can still make your own attacks as normal, along with any attacks the mount can make. If you fail the check, either you or your mount can make attacks, but not both.</p><hr /><h4>GUIDE WITH KNEES</h4><p>As part of a move action to ride a creature, you can guide it with your knees, keeping both of your hands free. If you fail the check, you must use one hand to guide your mount.</p><hr /><h4>LEAP</h4><p>As part of a move action, you can guide your mount to leap over an obstacle. If you succeed at the check, the mount must still succeed at an Athletics check to jump, but it can use your ranks in Survival in place of its ranks in Athletics, if that number is greater. If you fail the initial Survival check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage or 1d6 falling damage, whichever is greater.</p><hr /><h4>SOFT FALL</h4><p>As a reaction, you can reduce the damage you take from a fall off your mount (see page 400). With a successful check, you reduce the damage you take form the fall by 1d6.</p><hr /><h4>SPUR MOUNT</h4><p>As a move action, you can attempt to spur your mount to greater speeds. If you succeed at the check, the mount’s speed increases by 5 feet for that move action, but the mount takes 1d3 damage whether or not the check succeeds or fails. You can use this ability as often as you want, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the mount becomes fatigued. You cannot spur a fatigued mount.</p><hr /><h4>STAY MOUNTED</h4><p>As a reaction, you can try to avoid falling off your mount when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly, or when you take damage.</p><p>The base DCs for Survival checks to ride a creature depend on the attempted action and apply to riding the most common types of creatures and animals. At the GM’s discretion, dangerous or exotic beasts or those ill-suited for use as mounts can increase the DC of Survival checks to ride them by anywhere from 2 to 10. If you ride a creature bareback, you take a –5 penalty to Survival checks to ride or control that mount.</p><table class=\"NormalTable\"><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ACTION</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle0\">DC</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Control mount in battle</span></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">20</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Cover</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">15</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Fast mount or dismount</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">20</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Fight from a combat-trained mount</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">10</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Guide with knees</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">5</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Leap</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">15</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Soft fall</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">15</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Spur mount</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">15</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Stay mounted</span></td><td><span class=\"fontstyle2\">5</span></td></tr></tbody></table>",
