If a disease lacks a Cure entry, its progression may be irreversible without powerful magic or technology, but a successful casting of <em>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction}</em> usually prevents further deterioration. Physical and mental diseases have separate tracks. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"framing\">Physical Disease Track</h1>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Latent&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Debilitated&mdash;Bedridden&mdash;Comatose&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Latent</h3>\n<p>The victim has contracted a disease. She suffers no ill effects yet, but if the disease is contagious, she can pass it on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Weakened</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened} and @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.JGFn4MrDZ6X5vrzU]{Fatigued}.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Impaired</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted}. Whenever she takes a standard or full action, she must succeed at a Fortitude save at the disease&rsquo;s DC or lose the action and become @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated} for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Debilitated</h3>\n<p>Strenuous actions cause the victim pain. If she takes a standard action, she immediately loses 1 Hit Point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Bedridden</h3>\n<p>The victim is awake and can converse, but she can&rsquo;t stand on her own or take any other actions or reactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Comatose</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} and feverish, and can&rsquo;t be woken.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dead</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, and her corpse may still be contagious.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"framing\">Mental Disease Track</h1>\n<p><strong>Healthy&mdash;Latent&mdash;Weakened&mdash;Impaired&mdash;Befuddled&mdash;Disassociated&mdash;Comatose&mdash;Dead</strong></p>\n<h3>Latent</h3>\n<p>The victim can pass on contagious diseases but suffers no ill effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Weakened</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, and the DCs of his spells and special abilities decrease by 2. He can no longer cast his highest level of spells (if any).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Impaired</h3>\n<p>The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} and no longer adds his mental ability score modifiers when calculating number of uses per day of abilities dependent on those scores, including bonus spells per day. The DCs of his spells and special abilities decrease by an additional 2. He can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells (if any).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Befuddled</h3>\n<p>The victim begins losing his grasp on thought, reality, and self. He has a 50% chance each round to take no relevant actions, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen parties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Disassociated</h3>\n<p>The victim is almost entirely disconnected from reality. His mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms. He can no longer tell friend from foe and can&rsquo;t willingly accept any aid (including healing) from another creature unless he succeeds at a Will save against the disease&rsquo;s DC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Comatose</h3>\n<p>A victim rendered comatose by a mental disease has lost all grip on reality and entered a dream world. He can&rsquo;t be woken.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dead</h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">The victim is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, and his corpse may still be contagious.</span></p>",
