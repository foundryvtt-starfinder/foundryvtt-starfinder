The following adjustments apply whenever a character is swimming, walking in chest-deep water, or walking along the bottom of a body of water.</p>\n<h3>Attacks From Land</h3>\n<p>Characters swimming or floating in water that is at least chest deep and characters who are fully immersed have cover against attacks made from the surface.</p>\n<h3>Attacks Underwater</h3>\n<p>Most attacks made underwater take a –2 penalty and deal half damage. Attacks that deal fire damage do only one-quarter damage. Attacks that deal electricity damage take a –4 penalty rather than a –2 penalty. Melee attacks that deal piercing damage deal full damage. Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Underwater</h3>\n<p>A creature that is attempting Constitution checks to hold its breath can’t concentrate enough to cast spells. Some spells might work differently underwater, subject to the GM’s discretion.</p>\n<h2>Expanded rules</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.YYQn77To3lKzdjhk]{Underwater Combat (Expanded)}<sup>Source: AP #36 pg. 47</sup></p>",
