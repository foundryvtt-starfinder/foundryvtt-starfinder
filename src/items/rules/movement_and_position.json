Tactical movement, for combat, is measured in feet (or 5-foot squares) per round. Local movement, for exploring the immediate area, is usually measured in feet per minute, though you can also track movement on a local scale in rounds, as in tactical movement. Overland movement, for getting from place to place, is measured in miles per hour or miles per day.</p><p>Starships use their own movement scales for moving between planets and systems and for tactical starship combat.

Characters generally don’t walk during combat, for obvious reasons; they hustle or run instead. When you move your speed and take another action, you are hustling for about half the round and doing something else the other half.</p><h2>Measuring Distance</h2><p>As a general rule, distance during tactical combat is measured assuming that 1 square equals 5 feet.</p><h3>Diagonals</h3><p>When measuring distance, count the first diagonal as 1 square, the second as 2 squares, the third as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on. You can’t move diagonally past a hard corner (such as the corner of a building or starship or the side of a doorframe), but you can move diagonally past a creature (even an opponent) or less rigid objects, such as plant life.</p><h3>Closest Creature</h3><p>Sometimes it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location. If two squares or creatures are equally close, the creature taking the action that requires the closest square be determined decides which square counts as closest.</p><h2>Moving Through Occupied Squares</h2><p>You may be able to move through an occupied square without difficulty in certain circumstances, with different effects based on the creature in a given square, as noted below.</p><h3>Ally</h3><p>Unless you are charging, you can move through a square occupied by an ally or a friendly character. When you do so, that creature doesn’t provide you with cover (see page 253).</p><h3>Opponent</h3><p>You can’t normally move through a square that is occupied by an opponent, but you can move through a square that is occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. Some creatures, particularly very large ones, present an obstacle even when helpless; in such cases, each such square you move through counts as 2 squares. It is also possible to use the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0#tumble]{tumble} task of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} skill to move through a square occupied by an opponent (see page 136). Some creatures break these rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies (such as a 5-foot-cube robot) cannot be moved past, even with the Acrobatics skill or similar abilities.</p><h3>Ending Your Movement</h3><p>You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless that creature is helpless.</p><h2>Terrain And Obstacles</h2><p>From cargo crates and wrecked vehicles to vines and rocky rubble, many terrain features affect your movement.</p><h3>Difficult Terrain</h3><p>Difficult terrain, such as heavy undergrowth, piles of junk, or steep stairs, hampers movement. Each move into a square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain. If you occupy multiple squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain will allow. Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by most difficult terrain, though a dense tree canopy or web of chains might count as difficult terrain for flying creatures.</p><h3>Squeezing</h3><p>In some cases, you have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. While squeezing, you have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{entangled} condition (see page 275), which includes moving at half your speed.</p><h2>Special Movement Rules</h2><p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p><h3>Ending Movement In An Illegal Space</h3><p>Sometimes you may need to end your movement while moving through a space where you’re not allowed to stop. When that happens, you stop in the last legal position you occupied.</p><h3>Double Movement Cost</h3><p>When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double the normal amount. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p><p>If a movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule regarding multiplying values.</p><h3>Minimum Movement</h3><p>Despite whatever penalties to your speed you might have, as long as you can move at all you can take a full action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.GtSmojwt4d6rdEkm#attack-of-opportunity]{attacks of opportunity} as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn’t a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.SKgwxeMd2gB1g2W8#guarded-step]{guarded step}).</p>",

Walking for longer than that can wear you out (see Forced March below).</p><h2>Hustle</h2><p>You can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 nonlethal damage to you, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. If you take any nonlethal damage from hustling, you become fatigued (see page 276). When you recover from this nonlethal damage, you also eliminate the fatigued condition.</p><h2>Run</h2><p>You can’t run overland for an extended period of time. Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.</p><h2>Terrain</h2><p>The terrain through which you travel affects the distance you can cover while traveling. The table below shows you how to modify travel times based on the type of terrain and the quality of the path you’re following. A highway is a major, mostly straight, paved road. A road is typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td><strong>Highway</strong></td><td><strong>Road or Trail</strong></td><td><strong>Trackless</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Desert (all temperatures)</td><td>×1</td><td>×1/2</td><td>×1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Forest (typical)</td><td>×1</td><td>×1</td><td>×1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Forest (dense)</td><td>×1</td><td>×3/4</td><td>×1/4</td></tr><tr><td>Hill</td><td>×1</td><td>×3/4</td><td>×1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Marsh</td><td>×1</td><td>×3/4</td><td>×1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain</td><td>×3/4</td><td>×3/ 4</td><td>×1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Plains</td><td>×1</td><td>×1</td><td>×3/4</td></tr><tr><td>Urban</td><td>×3/4</td><td>×1/2</td><td>×1/2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Forced March</h2><p>In a day of normal walking, you walk for 8 hours, and then you spend the rest of your daylight time making and breaking camp, resting, and eating. However, you can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, you must succeed at a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 2 per extra hour) or you take 1d6 nonlethal damage. If you take any nonlethal damage from a forced march, you become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.JGFn4MrDZ6X5vrzU]{fatigued} (see page 276). When you recover from this nonlethal damage, you also eliminate the fatigued condition. Still, it’s quite possible to march yourself into unconsciousness by pushing yourself too hard.</p>",

Likewise, it’s easy for a fast character to get away from a slower one.</p><p>When the speeds of the two characters are equal, there are a few simple ways to resolve a chase. If one creature is pursuing another—both are moving at the same speed—and the chase continues for at least a few rounds, the characters can attempt opposed Dexterity checks to see who is the faster individual over those rounds. If the creature being chased wins, it escapes. If the pursuer wins, it catches the fleeing creature.</p><p>Sometimes a chase occurs overland and could last all day, with the two sides only occasionally getting glimpses of each other at a distance. In the event of a long chase, all parties can attempt opposed Constitution checks to determine which one can maintain the pace the longest. If the creature being chased rolls the highest, it gets away. If not, the pursuer runs down its prey, outlasting it through superior stamina.</p><p>Vehicle chases follow their own rules; see Vehicle Chases starting on page 282.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 258</p><p>Some creatures have modes of movement other than walking and running, such as burrowing, climbing, flying, and swimming. Such creatures have a specific speed listed for each movement type. Generally speaking, these additional movement types follow the normal rules for movement, except as detailed below.</p><h2>Burrowing</h2><p>If you have a burrow speed, you can use move actions to tunnel through dirt. You cannot tunnel through rock unless you have an ability that states otherwise. You can move your full burrow speed while burrowing, but you cannot @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.Fu5eDR99bGo9WdUU#run]{run} (see page 248). Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind tunnels other creatures can use unless they have an ability that states otherwise; instead, the dirt closes up behind them as if they had not been there.</p><h2>Climbing</h2><p>If you have a climb speed, you can use move actions to climb slopes, walls, and other steep inclines, and you don’t need to attempt an Athletics check to climb except in hazardous circumstances (see the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} skill starting on page 136). You are not @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{flat-footed} (see page 276) while climbing. You receive a +8 bonus to all Athletics checks to climb and can always take 10 while climbing, even if distracted or threatened. You can move your full climb speed when you use the move action while climbing, but you cannot run. You can move double your climb speed with a successful Athletics check to climb, but you take a –5 penalty to the check. Creatures without a climb speed use the Athletics skill to climb.</p><h2>Flying</h2><p>If you have a fly speed, you can use move actions to fly through the air. A creature with a fly speed has one of three maneuverability classes: clumsy, average, or perfect. Creatures with clumsy maneuverability take a –8 penalty to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} checks to fly, while those with perfect maneuverability gain a +8 bonus to these checks. Creatures with average maneuverability (the default maneuverability) neither gain a bonus nor take a penalty to Acrobatics checks to fly. While you are flying, at the start of each turn, choose a primary direction for the round (including up or down). You can move your full fly speed in a straight line in that direction without the need for an Acrobatics check, as long as the wind conditions are favorable.</p><p>If you want to change direction while flying, it costs you an additional 5 feet of movement to turn 45 degrees. If you want to ascend, it costs you an additional 5 feet of movement for each square that you move upward. For example, suppose you have a fly speed of 60 feet. As a single move action, you can fly forward 20 feet, turn 45 degrees to the left, and fly one square diagonally (all of which costs 30 feet of your movement). You can then ascend 15 feet, which costs another 30 feet of movement. At this point, you have used your full 60 feet of flying movement, so your move action is over.</p><p>If you are flying in an area with zero or low gravity, movement to ascend does not cost extra squares. If you are flying in an area with high gravity, ascending costs double the extra squares of movement.</p><p>The Acrobatics skill also details other types of movement that can be made by flying creatures. These require successful Acrobatics checks, and these checks have consequences if you fail. If you have clumsy maneuverability, you cannot use the hover option presented in the fly task of the Acrobatics skill (see page 135). If you have average maneuverability, all of the options in the fly task of Acrobatics are available to you. If you have perfect maneuverability, you do not have to attempt an Acrobatics check to use the avoid falling damage or hover options; you automatically succeed at these options (unless you are unconscious), though you can still attempt an Acrobatics check to hover as a swift action instead of a move action.</p><h2>Swimming</h2><p>If you have a swim speed, you can use move actions to swim through liquids, but you don’t need to attempt an Athletics check to swim except in hazardous circumstances (see the Athletics skill starting on page 136). You receive a +8 bonus to all Athletics checks to swim, and you can always take 10 while swimming, even if you are distracted or threatened. You can move your full swim speed while swimming, and you can use the run action while swimming, provided that you swim in a straight line. Creatures without a swim speed use the Athletics skill to swim. A swim speed does not automatically impart the ability to breathe underwater.</p>",
