        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> CRB pg. 208</p><p>Many explorers and mercenaries modify their own bodies with technological or biological gear called augmentations. These are modifications to your body that give you special abilities and bonuses. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can’t be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects or target technological items or creatures. As far as attacks and abilities are concerned, a cybernetic or vat-grown arm is no more (or less) vulnerable than your original biological limb.</p><h2>System</h2><p>All augmentations have a system entry indicating the part of the body into which it must be installed. You can’t have more than one augmentation on the same part of your body.</p><p>In some cases, such as with augmentations installed in limbs, you can install an augmentation into a single general type of body part, such as any single one of your feet or hands. In these cases, the augmentation lists the acceptable body parts into which the augmentation can be installed. You can install a single augmentation on each limb of which you have multiples. For example, if you’re a kasatha, you could install a separate augmentation on each of your four hands, as long as each of those augmentations requires only a single hand.</p><p>If an augmentation requires multiple limbs for installation— such as climbing suckers, which require all feet, or a speed suspension, which requires all legs—the augmentation’s systems entry indicates that requirement. The augmentation’s description will also indicate whether a limb-based upgrade requires the replacement of a limb or the augmentation of an existing limb. In the case of augmentations that specifically replace a lost limb, such as a polyhand or a prosthetic limb, you cannot attach such an augmentation to an existing limb, due to the way these upgrades are manufactured.</p><p>Common Systems: Although exceptions do exist, most augmentations require installation into one of the following body systems: arm (or all arms), brain, ears, eyes, foot (or all feet), hand (or all hands), heart, leg (or all legs), lungs, spinal column, skin, and throat.</p><h2>Implantation</h2><p>Getting an augmentation installed requires the services of a professional cybernetic surgeon or someone with ranks in Medicine equal to the level of the augmentation. A session with a cybernetic surgeon usually takes 1 hour per level of the augmentation. The price of such implantation procedures is included in the prices listed for each augmentation.</p><h2>Removing Augmentations</h2><p>You might want to have an augmentation removed, usually because you want to install a different one in the same system of your body. This removal usually occurs during surgery to install new cybernetics. Biotech usually kills off the old augmentation while it’s integrating with your body, allowing you to purge the dead biotech naturally. Because augmentations are coded to your body, it’s not possible to resell an old augmentation, nor can you reimplant one into a different person. The price of a new augmentation includes the price and time to remove the old augmentation.</p><h2>Activation</h2><p>Most augmentations work continuously. Those requiring some degree of control are plugged into your nervous system, and you can turn them on or off as a standard action unless otherwise noted. For example, you could activate or deactivate cybernetics in your eyes to observe different visual phenomena.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> ARM pg. 94</p><p>Necrografts are augmentations utilizing undead organs and necromantic rituals rather than technology. They were invented on Eox, and they are most commonly available in Orphys and at the Necroforge within Eox’s Lifeline. Most other Pact Worlds outlaw the creation and installation of necrografts (though not their possession), but they can still be found in some less reputable back-alley augmentation clinics on multiple worlds throughout the system and beyond.</p><p>Necrografts follow the existing rules for augmentations (Core Rulebook 208), but they use different components than biotech and cybernetics. Any biotech or cybernetic augmentation can be created as a necrograft and installed for only 90% of the augmentation’s normal cost, but doing so causes the recipient to gain the necrograft subtype (see below). Necrografts have the same system restrictions that all augmentations share.</p><p>For those low on funds, some bone sages and corporations on Eox are willing to defer the cost of travel to Eox and augmentation for any client who signs a corpse-lease agreement. Necrograft versions of standard prosthetic limbs (Core Rulebook 210) and necrograft ears, eyes, or tongues (which use the same mechanics as prosthetic limbs but serve as sensory organs and occupy the corresponding system) can even be implanted with no up-front cost. However, the corpselease agreement states that if the recipient dies before paying off all the costs associated with the travel and augmentation, the leasing Eoxian group owns the patient’s body, which it then uses in creating undead servitors or more necrografts. More advanced necrografts aren’t generally available without payment in full (though complimentary travel is likely to still be offered to customers within the Pact Worlds).</p><h2>Necrograft Subtype</h2><p>Adding even a single necrograft to a living body causes the recipient creature to gain the necrograft subtype. Abilities, items, and spells that detect or identify undead reveal necrografts (identifying only the augmentations as undead, rather than the recipient creature as a whole).</p><p>Creatures with this subtype are also damaged by spells that damage undead and can be subjected to other undead-specific effects. If a spell or ability that does something other than deal damage would not normally affect such a creature but does affect undead, it can affect a creature with the necrograft subtype, but that creature gains a bonus to its AC and saving throw against the effect equal to 4 – the number of necrografts it has (to a minimum bonus of +0).</p><h2>Necrograft Descriptions</h2><p>In addition to necrograft versions of typical biotech and cybernetics, there are many unique necrografts that can be created using only necromancy. These necrografts come in five possible models (mk 1 through mk 5) and vary in price by model as detailed on Table 1–22: Necrografts below. If a necrograft’s effect requires a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + half the necrograft’s item level + the recipient’s key ability score modifier. In addition, this section presents an additional system that some augmentations must be installed in: the body’s endocrine system. The endocrine system uses all of the same rules for augmentation systems as explained on page 208 of the Core Rulebook.</p><h2>Table 1-22: Necrografts</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Model</th><th>Level</th><th>Level</th></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td>Mk 1</td><td>1</td><td>200</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td>Mk 2</td><td>6</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td>Mk 3</td><td>12</td><td>30,000</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td>Mk 4</td><td>18</td><td>350,000</td></tr><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td>Mk 5</td><td>20</td><td>775,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

A mk 1 personal upgrade grants you +2 points to a single ability score, a mk 2 personal upgrade grants +4 points to a single ability score, and a mk 3 personal upgrade grants you +6 points to a single ability score. Each of your personal upgrades must be a different model number (for example, you cannot have three mk 1 upgrades, but you can have a mk 1, a mk 2, and a mk 3) and each must be applied to a different ability score. You can boost an existing personal upgrade by paying the difference in price between the current model and the next higher model.

Species grafts follow the rules for augmentations, in that they are installed in specific systems on your body. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can't be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects. Most of these augmentations are installed into the more common systems. <br /><br />Species grafts can be cybernetics, biotech, magitech, nanite enhancements, or any other form of augmentation. A specific species graft might describe its form, but that is merely an example. Your GM might decide what a species graft looks like when you purchase one or you might determine its specifics when you craft it. This doesn't affect how a species graft functions—only its appearance. <br /><br />The benefits of a species graft don't stack with the benefits granted by a racial trait of the same name. For example, a vesk character can't benefit from the armor savant graft. Species grafts are different from other augmentations in that they count as the racial trait mentioned in the name of the graft, and having one installed allows you to take feats and other player options that have that racial trait as a prerequisite. For example, if you have a limited telepathy graft installed, you count as having the limited telepathy racial trait in order to satisfy the prerequisite for the Extended Telepathy feat. You can't replace racial traits granted by species grafts with alternate racial traits, as those must be chosen at 1st level. <br /><br />If you have a species graft removed, you no longer count as having the associated racial trait. If you have feats or other options with that racial trait as a prerequisite, you can no longer use them. You can replace a feat with a new one that has no prerequisites by spending a full week retraining.</p>",
