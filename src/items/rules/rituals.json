        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 89</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A ritual is detailed in a document known as a ritual script. Story-wise, a ritual script can take many forms: an old tome collecting dust on a library shelf, a mysterious obelisk carved with indecipherable runes, or a digital file hidden deep within a world’s infosphere. A ritual script can be in any language and might also be hard to read or decipher; skills (such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.IqOCYDKd9NgBwowp]{Computers}) and magic (such as </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">comprehend languages</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">) might be necessary to translate or decode it. In terms of game mechanics, each ritual script describes the ritual actions— specific actions detailed later in this section—that are required for the completion of the ritual.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Before a character can use a script, however, they must find it in the first place. Characters can cast only rituals they have access to, and while academies that teach magic often provide access to common and harmless rituals that have obvious utility, more potent or dangerous rituals are locked in secure vaults. Aspiring ritualists scour the galaxy looking for rare rituals known only to lost civilizations like the sivv or kishalee.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once a ritual script is found, its ritual can be learned through the master a ritual downtime activity (below); this activity follows the rules of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.73lSOAnF2qMQLWoS]{downtime activities} presented on page 150 of the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><em>Character Operations Manual</em></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. The downtime activity isn’t strictly necessary; a ritual can be performed from the script without learning it, but doing so is more difficult. Learning a ritual has two benefits. First, a ritual leader who has learned a ritual no longer needs access to the ritual to cast it; they can perform it from memory. Second, the DC for checks required by ritual actions is lower if the ritualist has learned the ritual.</span></p><h2>Master a Ritual</h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You attempt to learn or practice a ritual to successfully cast it and reduce the danger posed by failure.</span></p><ul><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Activity:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Name a single ritual to which you have access or know. You spend the day practicing this ritual.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Results:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">For 1 day, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks required as part of ritual actions taken to cast the ritual you named.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Multiday:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When you spend a week on this downtime activity, you can attempt to learn the ritual; alternatively, you can teach a ritual you already know to a number of people equal to your ranks in Mysticism. Attempt a Mysticism check; the DC of this check is 10 + 3 × the level of the ritual. If you succeed, you learn the ritual, or, if you were teaching it, everyone you taught learns it. If you fail, you can take another week and use this downtime activity to try again</span>.</p></li></ul>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 89</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Most rituals have a level, from 1 to 6, that corresponds to their power, how difficult they are to perform, and some statistics associated with them. Some rituals can be learned and performed at different levels, with different effects depending on the level. When you learn a variable-level ritual, you learn all lower-level versions at the same time. The script for a variable-level ritual depends on the level. A ritual’s description lists the script for each level of a variable-level ritual.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The individuals who perform a ritual are known as ritualists, and they don’t need to be spellcasters. Every ritual requires at least one person, the ritual leader, who must either have access to the ritual or have learned it. Additional individuals might be able to help perform the ritual; these participants are ritual assistants. Each ritual lists how many assistants can participate, if any. Most rituals allow assistants, and some require them, but a few must be performed by the ritual</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">leader alone. A ritual leader can never lead more assistants than the leader has ranks in Mysticism, and once the ritual begins, they remain the leader for the entire ritual.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Rituals are performed over a number of ritual rounds. The length of time represented by a ritual round depends on the ritual and can be found in that ritual’s description. Each round, the leader and assistants select ritual actions; these actions are detailed below. Unless someone pauses the ritual using the maintain ritual action, the actions in the ritual script must be taken in order, one per round, until the ritual is complete; otherwise, the ritual fails. Generally, a ritual requires a number of actions equal to the ritual’s level, but the number of actions can vary.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Each ritual round, characters can take their actions in any order. While the ritual leader is usually taking the ritual action required by the script, assistants have more options when it comes to their choice of action, and sometimes actions required in the script can be taken by any character, not just the leader. For example, an assistant might choose to act before the leader to take the harmonize action and grant a bonus to the leader’s check, or that same assistant might wait to act until after the leader has acted, to use the martyr self or salvage ritual action.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Ritual actions often require a skill check, a saving throw, or some other activity, such as the sacrifice of valuable goods. Whenever a ritual action requires a skill check or saving throw, the DC can be found on Table 3–2: Rituals. If the ritualist hasn’t learned the ritual, the DC is 5 higher.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When an action required as part of a ritual script succeeds, the ritual continues for another round, when the next action in the script can be attempted. Failure on a ritual action required as part of a script, however, can have several consequences, listed in the ritual script. If neither “failure” nor “retry” is listed, the ritual action succeeds despite the failed check or saving throw, but the character who took the action suffers the consequences listed.</span></p><ul><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Damage: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The character takes damage appropriate to the level of the ritual, according to Table 3–2: Rituals. If the damage has a type, it’s noted here.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Condition: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The character gains the listed condition for the length of time noted.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Failure: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The ritual fails.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Retry: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The action fails, but the ritual has not. The failed action must be attempted again on the next round, unless the ritual is paused through the maintain ritual action.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Certain ritual actions allow assistants to save a ritual that would fail or to take damage or a condition that would incapacitate the ritual leader, potentially saving the ritual from failure.</span></p><h2>Variable-Level Rituals</h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Some rituals have different effects depending on the level at which you perform the ritual. When you learn a variablelevel ritual, you learn all lower level versions at the same time. The script for a variable-level ritual depends on the level. A ritual’s description lists the script for each level of a variable-level ritual.</span></p><h2>Creature-Creation Rituals</h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Some spells create creatures, turning an inanimate object into a construct, for example, or converting a corpse into undead. The creatures these spells can create are limited by the level of the ritual; the higher the ritual level, the higher the CR of the creatures it can be used to create, according to Table 3–2: Rituals.</span></p>",

Some rituals might modify the actions listed here or require new or unique actions.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Leader)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You gather ambient magic from the environment to fuel the ritual. Attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Harmonize (Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You attempt to aid a ritual leader who’s attempting a skill check, supporting them with ritual chants, meditation, dance, or another activity. Attempt a DC 15 check using the skill the ritual leader is attempting in a ritual action; if you succeed, you grant a +2 bonus to the ritual leader’s skill check this round.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Invoke Entity (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You channel the power of a deity or similar entity through yourself to power the ritual. This ritual action always succeeds but is still extremely dangerous; attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script. If you succeed, you’re unharmed. If you fail, you take the damage or effect listed in the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Join Ritual (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You join a ritual that has already started. You must take this action at the beginning of a ritual round, and you can take another ritual action this round.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Leave Ritual (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You leave the ritual, and you can perform non-ritual actions during ritual rounds, including this one, until you rejoin.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Maintain Ritual (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You maintain a ritual without working toward its conclusion, usually so that the ritual leader can rest or perform other actions. You must attempt this action before any other ritual action is attempted in the same round. Attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If you succeed, the ritual is paused for one ritual round; no one can perform a ritual action for the ritual this round, but the ritual doesn’t fail. A ritual can be maintained multiple times, and as long as the saving throws succeed, the ritual can be resumed with the next ritual action required by the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Martyr Self (Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This action must be taken immediately after a ritualist in the same ritual as you takes damage or gains a condition or some other harmful effect as a consequence of a failed check or save in a ritual action this round. You volunteer yourself to take that harm. The damage or effect is transferred to you, and it can’t be reduced or mitigated in any way. You can’t take this action if you’ve already taken damage or suffered a harmful effect this round.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Open the Way (Leader)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You draw power from another plane—perhaps through a specially attuned magic item or a temporary portal—and then channel that power into the ritual. Attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script. Sometimes failing this check can have unpredictable results, releasing denizens of other planes into your location.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You mark out a sacred or mystically aligned area where the ritual will take place. Doing so might involve scribing a pattern on the floor, setting up candles or other ritual paraphernalia, and sanctifying the area with ritual phrases. Attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Release Power (Leader)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Having gathered and shaped the power of your ritual, you now unleash it and hope for the desired outcome. Attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (Leader or Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You sacrifice objects of value to power the ritual. No check or saving throw is required, but you must sacrifice whatever is listed in the script. If the sacrifice listed is “Resolve,” the leader must spend 1 Resolve Point. If the sacrifice is “Items” and no other information is provided, you must sacrifice items with a value appropriate to the level of the ritual, as shown on Table 3–2: Rituals. Sacrificed items are destroyed unless otherwise noted. If you complete this sacrifice, the action succeeds. If you don’t, the action and ritual fail. Some evil rituals might require the sacrifice of sapient creatures.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Salvage Ritual (Assistant)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You try to save a ritual that’s about to fail. When a ritual leader fails a skill check as part of a ritual action, you take this action to attempt the check yourself. The DC for this check is 5 higher than the DC listed on Table 3–2: Rituals. Substitute the result of your check for the ritual leader’s failed check. Your check has the same consequences of success or failure that the leader’s action had.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Shape Power (Leader)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Having gathered magical energy from the environment, other planes, or a deity, you now shape that power into the proper form. Attempt the check or saving throw listed in the script.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Speak the Name (Leader)</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You direct your ritual against a specific target, whose name you must know. No check is required for this action, but if you don’t name someone clearly and unambiguously, the ritual fails.</span></p>",

Upon successful completion of the ritual, the information is recorded on a datapad, computer or notebook and remains available indefinitely. If you do not have a storage device at hand, the information is instead stored in your mind with perfect clarity for 1 week, during which you can transcribe it. After 1 week, the information is as likely to be forgotten or misremembered as a mundane memory.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This ritual primarily draws information from public sources like infospheres and popular legends. Periodically, the ritual also includes allusions or partial quotes from private collections, strong memories, or inscriptions on forgotten tablets, but these references at best hint at additional lore and are no substitute for directly studying those sources. Finally, though the ritual provides a faithful report, it might include widespread myths, misconceptions, and misinformation alongside verifiable facts.</span></p><h2>Awaken (4)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Mysticism; dazed for 1 hour), Sacrifice (items and Resolve), Release Power (Will; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 10 minutes</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You expand the mental faculties of an animal, a construct, or a computer, granting them humanlike intellect. The subject must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence modifier or –4 or lower. The subject’s Intelligence modifier becomes +0, +1, +2, or +3, determined randomly (roll 1d4–1), and if their Wisdom and Charisma modifiers are lower than +0, those increase to +0. The awakened subject begins with a friendly attitude toward the ritualists but has no compulsion to obey them. The subject to be awakened must be present during the entirety of the ritual. An awakened animal’s type changes to magical beast.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Casting this ritual on a willing creature companion dissolves the bond between it and its master.</span></p><h2>Commune (5)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 91</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Space (Mysticism; failure), Sacrifice (1 Resolve Point), Invoke Entity (Will; fatigued, retry), Sacrifice (items worth 1,000 credits)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> 3</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You call upon an unknown planar entity to answer questions. This is a servitor of your deity if you have one. You can ask up to seven questions that can be answered with “Yes” or “No.” The entity is likely to know answers related to its purview; a servitor of Triune would know about objects located in the Drift, and a servitor of Damoritosh would know about the Veskarium. The entity answers with one-word answers such as “Yes,” “No,” “Likely,” or “Unknown,” though its answers always reflect its own agenda and could be deceptive. This ritual can’t uncover information directly related to the Gap.</span></p><h2>Consecrate Place (2)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 91</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (incense and offerings worth 2,000 credits), Prepare the Space (Mysticism; retry), Invoke Entity (Will; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 day</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You consecrate a site to your deity. The effects of this ritual last for 1 year, and they extend in a 40-foot radius centered on an immobile shrine, altar, or fixture of your deity. While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 divine bonus to Armor Class, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If your deity is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, attacks by your worshippers made from within the area are chaotic-aligned, evil-aligned, good-aligned, or lawful-aligned, respectively.</span></p><h2>FTL Communication (4)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 91</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Open the Way (Computers; dazed for 1 minute, failure), Shape Power (Mysticism; electricity damage, retry),</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Speak the Name (Will; dazed for 1 minute), Release Power (Computers; failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> none</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 minute</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You communicate with someone over interstellar distances. You must touch a comm unit at the end of this ritual and speak a message of 25 words or fewer. Your message travels to the person you named in the Speak the Name action, but takes time to arrive: 1d6 hours if the individual is in the same system as you, 3d6 hours if the individual is in Near Space or the Pact Worlds, or 5d6 hours if the individual is in the Vast. When the message arrives, the individual you named hears it and can respond with up to 25 words. This reply takes 1d6 hours to reach you if you’re in the same system as the individual replying, 3d6 hours if you’re in Near Space, or 5d6 hours if you’re in the Vast. When it reaches you, you hear it.</span></p><h2>Gate (6)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 92</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Space (Engineering or Mysticism; failure), Gather Power (Mysticism; dazed for 1 hour, failure), Shape Power (Engineering or Mysticism; fatigued, retry), Release Power (Mysticism; electricity damage, retry), Open the Way (Will; the gate opens to a random location for a random duration, both determined by the GM)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 day</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You link two physical portals—such as doors or arches—to permit instantaneous travel between them. The portals can be up to 15 feet across, separated by any distance or even on different planes, and each must be constructed with at least 1,000,000 credits’ worth of materials. Each portal must have a designated entry direction and an exit direction. You must perform this ritual at one of the two portals, and neither portal can already be connected to a portal through a </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">gate </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ritual. If the ritual is completed, any creature who moves through one portal’s entry emerges from the other portal’s exit. The surfaces of the portals are usually magically obscured, so it’s impossible to tell where a portal leads; however, a creature who observes a portal from its entry direction, takes a full action, and succeeds at a DC 25 Mysticism check can cause the portal to briefly clear and see out the paired portal’s exit for one round. If Engineering was used in the ritual actions that created this gate, the creature can use Computers or Engineering instead of Mysticism for this check.</span></p><h2>Heartbond (1)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 92</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Speak the Name (the names of the two individuals being bonded)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> none</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You create a magical bond between two willing creatures who share genuine affection for each other. As part of the ritual, both members of the bond receive a ring, amulet, or similar token to symbolize their shared connection; these items must</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">each be worth at least 100 credits. When both individuals are wearing their tokens, they can, once per day as a standard action, sense the condition of the other as per the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.Mn5F4th3ctW5oKJ4]{Status} </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">spell. If either token is destroyed, the effect of the ritual ends.</span></p><h2>Hidden Bastion (5)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Engineering; dazed for 1 hour, failure), Gather Power (Will; fatigued, retry), Open the Way (Mysticism; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 10 minutes</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You create a door that leads to an extradimensional space. The door must be placed in an existing wall or other surface, is 8 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and can otherwise have any design you wish, or can look like nothing more than a faint shimmering in the air. At your discretion, the door becomes invisible when closed. The design of the space beyond the door is up to you, occupying a maximum of fifty 10-foot cubes with your choice of mundane furnishings, entertainment, and other amenities. The bastion regularly produces enough food to feed up to 20 people per day. While you are in the bastion, you are treated as being on a different plane from anyone outside the bastion for the purpose of attempts to contact you or divine your location. The bastion lasts for 1 week. Any objects created by the bastion vanish if removed from the space, and the bastion deposits any other creatures or objects outside its door when the ritual ends</span>.</p><h2>Instantaneous Assembly (1)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (see text), Release Power (see text; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> up to 2</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 minute</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You swiftly transform raw materials into a manufactured item. To create an item with this ritual, you must have the requisite number of ranks in the skill normally required to craft the item (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Core Rulebook </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">page 235). During the sacrifice ritual action, you expend a number of UPBs equal to the item’s price. The skill check used to perform the release power ritual action is the same skill that would normally be used to craft the item (such as Engineering for technological objects). If you fail that check, the ritual fails, but you can recuperate 90% of the UPBs expended by the sacrifice action.</span></p><h2>Invigorating Banquet</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Life Science, Profession [cook], or Survival; sickened for 1 minute; retry), Sacrifice (Resolve), Shape Power (Mysticism; failure)</span> </p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> up to 2</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You conjure a great feast, including any tables, seating, utensils, and dishware. The details of the feast are up to the ritual participants, and the ritual produces enough delicious food and drink to feed 12 creatures. Creatures who spend at least 1 hour partaking of the banquet gain 2d10 temporary Hit Points, a +1 enhancement bonus to saving throws, and 1 Resolve point. These bonuses last for 24 hours or until you take a long rest. The additional Resolve Point can bring your total Resolve Points above your normal maximum.</span></p><h2>Invoke Curse (4-6)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong></p><ul><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>4th:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Invoke Entity (Mysticism; damage), Sacrifice (a body part of the target creature, such as hair, blood, or nails), Speak the Name (name of the individual to be cursed)</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>5th–6th:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Invoke Entity (Mysticism; damage), Sacrifice (a body part of the target creature), Speak the Name (name of the individual to be cursed), Release Power (Will; see text; failure)</span> </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> up to 3</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You curse a target as the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">bestow curse </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">spell, except that you can use this ritual to affect a target at any distance, so long as you know their name, they are on the same plane, have an appropriate object for the Sacrifice step. However, failing the Release Power step results in a 50% chance that the curse rebounds and is inflicted upon the ritual leader instead of the intended target. The curse’s target can attempt a Will save based on the ritual’s level (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><em>Galactic Magic</em> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">page 90) to negate the curse.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This ritual can be cast at 4th, 5th, or 6th level, primarily increasing the saving throw DC to resist the curse’s effects.</span></p><h2>Obsolescence (4-6)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>4th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Will; damage, retry), Sacrifice (items)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>5th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Will; damage, retry), Sacrifice (items), Release Power (Mysticism; dazed for 1 hour, retry)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>6th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Will, damage, retry), Sacrifice (items), Release Power (Mysticism; damage, failure)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You create a magical field that inhibits technology, covering a 2-mile radius centered on the ritual leader. This field persists indefinitely while the ritual leader remains in its area, and it lasts for 1d8 days after the ritual leader first leaves the area. Unattended technological items in the area whose item levels are less than 3 × the ritual’s level cease to function; items in a creature’s possession or being actively operated by a creature continue to function for 1 hour or until they become unattended, whichever occurs first, so long as that creature succeeds at a Will save whose DC is based on the ritual’s level (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Galactic Magic </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">page 90). Once a creature fails this save, their technological items cease functioning until they leave the leave the area for at least 1 minute. Tiny starships as well as vehicles and mechs that are Gargantuan or larger continue to function, but their speeds are reduced by half. Small and larger starships are not affected.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This ritual can be cast at 4th, 5th, or 6th level, primarily increasing the maximum item level of affected technology and saving throw DC to resist the field’s effects, as detailed above.</span></p><h2>Panopticon (3)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 93</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Space (items), Gather Power (Computers; fatigued, retry), Open the Way (Will; electricity damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> none</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You gain supernatural surveillance powers within a single large structure, such as a prison, school, or space station. You must perform this ritual within the chosen structure, and when you complete the ritual, you must touch a video screen. The screen can be of any size, but it can’t be moved. When you look at this screen, you can take a move action to make it display any location in the structure where it’s located, from any point of view within 100 feet of the screen, with low-light vision and darkvision up to 60 feet. The effects of this ritual last for 1 year, or until the screen is moved or broken, whichever comes first.</span></p><h2>Phantom Vehicle (1-6)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>1st-2nd:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Engineering; damage, retry), Release Power (Mysticism; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>3rd-6th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Engineering; damage, retry), Open the Way (Will; dazed 1 hour, retry), Release Power (Mysticism; damage, failure)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 10 minutes</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You tap into the Shadow Plane to conjure a terrestrial vehicle that exists for 8 hours. Anyone can ride in the vehicle, but anyone other than the ritual’s participants take a –4 penalty to Piloting checks to operate it. In addition, the ritual leader can substitute their Mysticism ranks for their Piloting ranks when operating the vehicle. The 1st-level version of this ritual can conjure an item level 1 vehicle; for every ritual level beyond 1st, the maximum item level increases by 3 (maximum level 16 for a 6th-level ritual). The conjured vehicle has a spectral appearance. Its composition is relatively frail; it has Hit Points equal to 10 × the ritual’s level.</span></p><h2>Planar Beacon (5)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Primary Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Mysticism; damage, retry),</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Mysticism; fatigued, failure), Sacrifice (items), Shape Power (Will; see text)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Secondary Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Mysticism; fatigued), Shape Power (Will; damage), Sacrifice (Resolve), Open the Way (Will; see text)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 10 minutes</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This formula includes two closely linked rituals that enable highly accurate extraplanar travel. The primary ritual follows the primary script to attune the ritual leader and assistants to an area no more than 60 feet in diameter, known as a beacon. An attuned participant can later lead the secondary ritual using its secondary script, which attempts to transport them and any of the secondary ritual’s assistants into the beacon’s area as </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">plane shift</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. Roll d% and consult the table below to determine how accurately the ritual transports the participants.</span></p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>D%</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Result</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1-95</p></td><td><p>You arrive in the beacon area.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>96-100</p></td><td><p>You arrive 5-500 miles away from the beacon in a random direction.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>101-115</p></td><td><p>The secondary ritual fails.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>116-120</p></td><td><p>You arrive in a place that's visually or thematically similar to the beacon's area, which might be on a completely different plane.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A beacon lasts for [[/r 10d10]] years or until dispelled. A creature can be attuned to up to 3 beacons at a time. If they attune to a fourth beacon, they end their attunement to one beacon of their choice.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If the ritual leader fails the Will save to shape power for the primary ritual, they create a flawed beacon. When using the secondary ritual to travel to a flawed beacon, add 20 to the d% result to determine the ritual’s result. If the ritual leader fails the Will save to open the way during the secondary ritual, roll d% twice and use the higher result when determining the ritual’s result.</span></p><h2>Reincarnation (4)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 93</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Prepare the Area (Mysticism; failure); Invoke Entity (Will; damage, failure); Sacrifice (items and Resolve); Speak the Name (the individual being reincarnated)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> any</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You call upon a deity or other cosmic force to create a new body for a dead individual, binding the individual’s soul to the new body and restoring them to life. This ritual can restore an individual who has been dead for days equal to the ritual leader’s ranks in Mysticism. The creature takes a temporary negative level for 24 hours. This ritual can’t resurrect creatures who are currently undead or who don’t wish to be resurrected, but it can restore individuals slain by death effects or whose original bodies are lost or destroyed.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The ritualists and the restored creature have no say over the form of the reincarnation, which can take the form of virtually any race, gender, and appearance. If this ritual is used to reincarnate a player character, the player and GM should mutually agree on the reincarnation’s physical details, choosing a playable race; if used to reincarnate an NPC, the GM decides the reincarnation’s physical form. A reincarnated character loses the ability score modifiers, HP, Size, type, and racial traits of their original race, and gains the ability score modifiers, HP, Size, type, and racial traits of their new race. Theme and class features are unchanged</span>.</p><h2>Rejuvenation (4)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> EN pg. 130</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Gather Power (Mysticism; damage, retry), Open the Way (Will; nauseated for 1 hour, failure), Sacrifice (Resolve), Release Power (Fortitude; fatigued and explosive growth)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> up to 2</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 1 hour</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You tap directly into the Positive Energy Plane, channeling its lifegiving essence to perform a healing miracle. Upon successfully completing the ritual, you touch a creature to perform one of the following effects of your choice.</span></p><ul><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The creature’s severed limbs grow back, as </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.9Jk5eas4Zz0Sd0LL]{Regenerate}</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You remove up to three afflictions affecting the creature, as </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.YGkyMwEE6SLfZc4r]{Remove Affliction}</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. Use the ritual leader’s level + 2 as this effect’s caster level.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You remove a negative level, heal ability damage, or heal ability drain as though you had cast </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">restoration</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, spending additional Resolve Points as needed to remove a permanent negative level.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you fail the Fortitude save during the release power activity, positive energy bursts from you in a 60-foot-radius spread. Areas with few organisms like buildings and streets instantly sprout colorful plants. Existing organisms receive a surge of vitality, which might cause them to grow, acquire strange features, or become aggressive. The GM determines the exact outcome, ranging from areas of difficult terrain to level-appropriate combat encounters.</span></p><h2>Summon Elemental (1-6)</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> GM pg. 93</p><ul><li><p><strong>Script:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>1st:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>2nd:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>3rd:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (items); Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>4th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (items); Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>5th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (items); Gather Power (Mysticism; damage, retry); Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>6th:</strong> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sacrifice (items); Gather Power (Mysticism; damage, retry); Open the Way (Fort; damage, failure)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Assistants:</strong> up to 1 per level of the ritual</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Length:</strong> 10 minutes</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You summon an elemental with a CR limited by the level of the ritual according to Table 3–2: Rituals. The elemental appears within 30 feet of you. Most elementals are only as smart as a clever animal, and their initial attitude is indifferent, but elementals with above-average Intelligence are unfriendly instead. Regardless, the elemental is under no obligation to obey you. It remains on the plane to which you’ve summoned it until it’s destroyed or sent back to its origin plane, such as through </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.sq2qCpHUQJIgfVvo]{Dismissal} </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">or some other method.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you fail a ritual action for this ritual that causes you to take damage, that damage has a type based on the kind of elemental you tried to summon: bludgeoning for an earth elemental, cold for a water elemental, fire for a fire elemental, and electricity for an air elemental.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can add the Prepare the Area action to the beginning of the script for this spell; the action requires a Mysticism check. If you do, the elemental appears within that area, and can’t leave or target creatures outside the area unless you allow it or your preparations are disturbed; the GM decides how much disturbance is required. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy or Intimidate checks against a creature trapped within your prepared area. If you fail the Mysticism check required for this ritual action, the elemental still appears in the space, but its movement and attacks aren’t restricted, and you gain no benefit to Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can add the Speak the Name action to the end of the script for this spell. If you do, you summon the specific elemental whose name you spoke, provided that elemental’s CR is equal to or less than that listed for the ritual’s level on Table 3–2: Rituals. Its initial attitude might be something other than indifferent, especially if it has had prior interactions with y</span>ou.</p>",

Most work identically to </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">summon elemental </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">with a few notable exceptions. First, most outsiders are more intelligent than elementals, and so their initial attitude is more likely to be unfriendly (though a devil might pretend to be friendly for its own purposes). Second, when a ritualist fails a ritual action that inflicts damage, that damage has a type appropriate to the plane the summoned creature comes from. For example, summoning a devil is likely to inflict fire damage. If no damage type is appropriate, the damage has no type. Summoning rituals can differ from the usual script and results in other, more specific ways; a wise ritualist learns all they can about the spell and the creature summoned before attempting the ritual!</span></p>",
