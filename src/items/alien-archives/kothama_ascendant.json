        "value": "<section>\n<h2>Kothama</h2>\n<p>Kothamas are massive, shaggy creatures with thick, trunk-like legs and two muscled arms. An average kothama is 18 feet tall and weighs 24 tons. Their flat faces have four glassy eyes, each one inky black and speckled with silver spots, and are perpetually facing skyward. Kothamas are agender; they breed by pairing up to fertilize one another, then go their separate ways to give birth alone.<br /><br />Kothamas are peaceful and solitary natives of the Veskarium&rsquo;s icy outermost planets, Vesk&ndash;7 and Vesk&ndash;8. The nocturnal species has a fascination with the starry sky, and most spend their nights alone, meditating on the cosmos from their simple homes at extremely high altitudes. The furry beasts prefer the extreme cold and thin air of the highest reaches of their planets, stemming from their origins on the frozen plains of Vesk-8. While kothamas can tolerate somewhat warmer temperatures, such as those in the equatorial regions of Vesk-7, they never feel truly comfortable unless approaching the heatless perfection of deep space.<br /><br />Twice a year, the orbits of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8 come close enough that one of the planets hands their shared moon, Traverse, off to the other. The moon orbits each planet for half a year before being transferred to the other. During these brief windows, a small percentage of kothamas from each planet make a traditional, deeply sacred journey from planet to moon to planet, using magic gates that are active only at such time. It is in this way alone that the normally detached and individual kothamas share information between planets, and they have yet to adopt faster communication technologies. Despite this, the cultures of both planets are remarkably consistent.<br /><br />When interacting with other species, kothamas tend to rely on their calming aura to keep things pleasant, resorting to violence only in rare instances of self-defense, or even incidentally as they trample smaller creatures while attempting to escape. When vesk invasion forces first arrived on their planets, kothamas&rsquo; calming presence unnerved the bellicose vesk, who had expected fierce resistance from the intimidatingly large creatures. A lack of natural resources (with the notable exception of shimmerstone) and centralized government&mdash;along with the extensive effort required to exert control over a large, diffuse population&mdash;has led to a minimal vesk presence on the kothamas&rsquo; home planets. In fact, an assignment to a post in this frigid, conflict-free frontier has become a form of punishment for vesk who have dishonored themselves in combat or become politically problematic.<br /><br />The majority of kothamas worship @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.bPtB2HxRcO7AYWyf]{Ibra}, god of the cosmos, though kothama temples to the Inscrutable are few and far between, as most maintain simple, personal shrines. Most kothamas spend much of their centuries-long lifespans deepening their connection with the stars, and after years of mystical contemplation, many become star shaman mystics. It is relatively common for older and more powerful kothamas, inured against the effects of vacuum, to fling themselves out into space so as to continue their meditation from within the void. When they do so, they enter a euphoric state of hibernation, becoming uncharacteristically angry and aggressive should something wake them.<br /><br />It is rare to see kothamas away from their home worlds of Vesk-7 and Vesk-8, but some kothamas occasionally decide to leave home and travel to other worlds, hoping to investigate the secrets of the cosmos from a different vantage. Without access to interplanetary spaceflight on their own, these kothamas must rely on other species to ferry them from world to world in starships. A rare few of these adventurous travelers even share their knowledge and theories of the cosmos with members of other species, founding observatories, temples to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.bPtB2HxRcO7AYWyf]{Ibra} or other cosmic entities, or cosmonasteries where solarians who seek an alternative philosophy to the Cycle may train and improve their abilities.<br /><br />Other kothamas have the misfortune of being conscripted into military service by the Veskarium. The kothamas&rsquo; deep understanding of the stars and the void of space makes them peerless navigators, but their size and pacifist nature makes them ill-suited to serve onboard starships. As such, conscripted kothamas are usually put to work on Vesk Prime creating or updating complex star maps and navigational charts for the use of the Veskarium&rsquo;s military forces. Unfortunately, these conscripted kothamas do not usually survive for long. The dissonance between their peaceful philosophy and their military service often becomes more than these kothamas can bear, and if not allowed to return to their solitary existences on their icy native worlds, such kothamas usually waste away and die in only a few years.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Vesk-7 or Vesk-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>star shaman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>",

This obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision and other vision-based senses (including vision-based blindsight and sense through), but doesn’t prevent blindsense. A creature within 5 feet of its attacker has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target). Additionally, the swirling cosmic particles are distracting to spellcasters in the area, who have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast in the area.

Depending on your desired effect (choose one from below), the spell can perform a variety of combat maneuvers, provide a gentle, sustained force, or exert a single short, violent thrust.<br><br><strong>Combat Maneuver:</strong> Once per round, you can use&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal, but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating.<br><br><strong>Sustained Force:</strong> A sustained force moves an object of no more than 25 pounds or 2 bulk per caster level up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell’s range.<br><br>You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example, a lever can be pulled, a key turned, a button pushed, an object rotated, and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.<br><br><strong>Violent Thrust:</strong> The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects, such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect, as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a thrown creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 1d6 damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.</p>",

If you don’t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item’s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed <em>holy laser pistol</em> is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Counter</strong>: You can use the energy of <em>dispel magic</em> to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast <em>dispel magic</em> when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast <em>dispel magic</em> and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster’s spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster’s caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range, the spell fails and has no result.</span></p>",
