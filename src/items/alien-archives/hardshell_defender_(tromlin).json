Each fighting style is composed of various style techniques that you learn as you gain experience. You must pick one fighting style upon taking your first soldier level, and once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from appear on pages 112–115.<em>(Or Below)</em></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.wqpDgnxCVh0K1pbU]{Ambusher}</h2>\n<p>The ambusher fighting style focuses on stealth, tactical positioning, and superior reflexes to gain an edge. You must have Stealth as a class skill to select this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.33fxlqpShtqndjry]{Arcane Assailant}</h2>\n<p>The arcane assailant fighting style supplements its combat effectiveness with magic powers, drawing on traditions of warrior-wizards dating back to well before the Gap. This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don’t have a magic weapon in your possession.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DAMcKQ3EGXdh8CGe]{Armor Storm}</h2>\n<p>The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor’s capacity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.oo4MlB56sziHi0lB]{Battlemaster}</h2>\n<p>The battlemaster fighting style focuses on adapting your natural advantages to new dangers and situations as they arise. By anticipating particular threats or adjusting mid-combat to deal with specific foes, you can assure your survival and gain the advantage. The following soldier fighting style is an adaptation of this technique that has made its way to the Pact Worlds. You must have the armor savant and natural weapons species traits to take this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.AKI0TQ3pSwmU5twg]{Blitz}</h2>\n<p>The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.YHaMYdptLi3fXfVH]{Bombard}</h2>\n<p>The bombard fighting style emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hdaFHWL1GAnSF4ZO]{Bullet Rain}</h2>\n<p>Whether the roar of flamethrowers heralds your entrance or the staccato beat of bullets punctuates your battle cries, you’re a master at using heavy weapons.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.6EJMD8EZbjuSnJPs]{Farshot}</h2>\n<p>For some, the best combat strategies eliminate the opposition before they’re even halfway close enough to pose a credible threat. You’re adept at keeping a low profile while launching consistent, patient, and deadly attacks from afar. This style is especially well suited to sniper weapons; activating a weapon’s sniper special property to increase a weapon’s range (typically as a move action) is referred to below as “aiming a sniper weapon,” and attacks made with that increased range are referred to as “aimed shots.”</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.qjAwXnudUtBHdZCe]{Fourfold Tactician}</h2>\n<p>A fourfold tactician is a master of making use of multiple weapons and still having a spare hand. You must have four or more arms to select or use this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.oHKHSbFfmBgFfvW8]{Guard}</h2>\n<p>The guard fighting style focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.Jba9qeZX5QgjZvwQ]{Hit-and-Run}</h2>\n<p>The hit-and-run fighting style focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.GvubHqBOlV1CsWvz]{Hunter}</h2>\n<p>You’re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks. You may use this expertise as a sniper, trophy hunter, sport enthusiast, or fugitive tracer. Far more focused on skills than other soldiers, your unique talents combine experience in the field with refined combat ability.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DtbNSlkOtxaaplbr]{Mine Menace}</h2>\n<p>A fair fight might earn a soldier bragging rights, but it’s just as likely to earn them a shallow grave. To compensate for their smaller stature, kobolds often employ traps to hinder their foes and level the playing field. Most notably, this fighting style relies on deploying inexpensive proximity mines and making cunning strikes while an opponent is rattled by the explosions.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.LpwKay3dwLJyjwra]{Powerhouse Style}</h2>\n<p>You specialize in getting the most out of unwieldy weapons, swinging the likes of doshkos and swoop hammers with unstoppable force. After all, you only need to hit your opponent once, as long as you hit them hard enough.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.2C2NBundSvw79yKG]{Qi Adept}</h2>\n<p>You are able to tap into your personal life force, enabling you to unleash incredible strikes upon your foes. Whether you’ve discovered these techniques on your own or studied at ancient monasteries and temples devoted to these lost arts, yours is a power cultivated through intense training and skill.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.bSx9gMPZnyCUHyhG]{Rover}</h2>\n<p>No wilderness gets the better of you, and thanks to your special training and hard-learned lessons, your leadership might be crucial to your companions surviving the wilds as well.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.PSAr1JTGPZQ9g1j8]{Sharpshoot}</h2>\n<p>The sharpshoot fighting style enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.tniq6wm0fQSzLbB0]{Shock and Awe}</h2>\n<p>The shock and awe fighting style excels at overwhelming enemies senses with overpowering auditory and visual stimuli. You can modify your weapons to issue thunderous booms or blazing flashes of light, at the same time mitigating these effects with regard to your own senses. This style is strongest with weapons that deal sonic damage or that affect an area.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.f34cpBT3OiXKXssf]{Squad}</h2>\n<p>Soldiers in large organizations, such as the Stewards, learn to fight effectively together in small squads. You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.HiI3JMXX6crpsWDN]{Wrathful Warrior}</h2>\n<p>The wrathful warrior style draws upon your emotions—specifically your rage and wrath—to enable devastating attacks. You may have trained yourself to intentionally overload your fight-or-flight adrenaline response, or may just come from a long line of berserker warriors. At higher levels, you’re able to use your anger to ignore damage and strike with impudence.</p>"

You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor’s capacity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.bMrNOiFOJYntHFVF]{Hammer Fist (Ex) (1st)}</h2>\n<p>You treat any unarmed strike you make while wearing heavy or powered armor as being made with a battleglove (see page 187) with an item level equal to or lower than your soldier level, and you calculate damage for these attacks as if you had the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.GoXXOPGD32mckcuD]{Melee Striker (Ex)} gear boost (see page 112). If you have the melee striker gear boost, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with your unarmed strike when using this ability. These unarmed strikes don’t benefit from other abilities that apply specifically to unarmed strikes (such as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.B45QyyepcPHcjYtr]{Improved Unarmed Strike (Combat)} feat).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.J2ihxKAsF68ol0vr]{Enhanced Tank (Ex) (2nd)}</h2>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.XFUghykvnCSVHJ9n]{Powered Armored Proficiency (Combat)} feat and access to improved armor. This might be the result of your own engineering abilities or a powerful patron giving you gear not available to the general public. You can add one more upgrade to your armor than its normal maximum number of upgrade slots. If you add this bonus upgrade to heavy armor, you can select an upgrade normally limited to powered armor. An upgrade placed in this bonus slot costs half the normal credit amount and sells for 10% of the reduced cost. If you move an upgrade from this bonus slot to another slot, you must pay the difference between the upgrade’s reduced cost and its normal cost.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.1qKKHF31zMkzTYBd]{Smash Through (Ex) (3rd)}</h2>\n<p>While you are wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls to perform a bull rush combat maneuver (see page 246). If you successfully push the target back 10 feet or more, you can also damage the target with an unarmed strike (and can use your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.bMrNOiFOJYntHFVF]{Hammer Fist (Ex) (1st)} ability when doing so).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.fwWAQ71KPxQjEIpV]{Mobile Army (Ex) (4th)}</h2>\n<p>You become a master of all weapons associated with your armor. You deal 1d6 additional damage with any attack from a weapon that is part of your armor, including unarmed strikes using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.bMrNOiFOJYntHFVF]{Hammer Fist (Ex) (1st)} ability and weapons that have been attached to your armor as an armor upgrade. The additional damage is of the same type as the weapon’s normal type. Also, while wearing heavy or powered armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your KAC against combat maneuvers.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.J1yTIeNG1ed1RZqB]{On the Bounce (Ex) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>You learn to control your armor with such ease, you are actually more maneuverable in it than out of it. While wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you can move up to your speed when you make a full attack. You can move before or after all your attacks, but not both. If you have the Shot on the Run feat, you can divide your movement to move both before and after making a full attack as long as all the attacks are ranged attacks. If you have the Spring Attack feat, you can divide your movement to move both before and after making a full attack as long as all the attacks are melee attacks. If you have both feats, your attacks can be any combination of melee and ranged attacks.</p>"

        "value": "<p>One of three sapient species native to the Gjor III in the Azlanti vassal system of Gjor, tromlins are a bellicose people divided into two distinct subspecies who warred for ages on the plains and forest floors of Gjor III. The bloodseeker strain is a bipedal, reptilian humanoid, while tromlin hardshells are natural quadrupeds. This ancient war is egged on by belief in tribes of warring spirits. Bloodseekers kill and eat any being too weak to oppose them, while herbivorous hardshells fight against their flesh-eating kin.</p>\n<p>Tromlins stubbornly resisted the Star Empire, but the two subspecies were unable to unite, and their technology was not advanced. Each surrendered to enslavement to forestall extinction. The Azlanti turned the warrior ethos of tromlins into a recruiting tool, and both subspecies became regular draftees into the Azlanti Alien Cohort.</p>\n<p>Even when serving in the same army, tromlins require strict leadership to prevent their rivalries from breaking out into violence. Mixed tromlin squads have yet to be deployed in offensive operations, but the imperial military has found success with tromlins of each subspecies working alongside each other in garrison duty.</p>",
