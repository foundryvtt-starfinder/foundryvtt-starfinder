        "value": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>In numerous technologically advanced societies, holograms are used in advertising, entertainment, and other industries to catch the eye when two-dimensional images would fail. At their simplest, holograms are silent, still images in a single color, often at a low resolution. More complex projectors can offer full color and a few repeated frames of animation, while the most advanced varieties can be programmed with artificial personalities and can interact with their viewers. Implementations of this most sophisticated version of the technology are wide ranging, and holograms serve as instructors in educational institutions, as tour guides for famous locales in large cities, and even as concierges at luxury hotels.<br /><br />On very rare occasions, usually through a fault in the machinery of its projector, an advanced hologram gains a modicum of sentience and, sometimes, a twisted idea of the reason for its existence. These &ldquo;tech ghosts,&rdquo; as some call them, can appear in almost any shape, limited only by the capabilities of their projectors, and they use their forms of living light to harass their foes-sometimes even striking from a hiding spot in another holographic display-though they are always confined to the area near their projectors. While very few ever encounter living holograms-or realize that they have-stories of tech ghosts haunting abandoned holoamusement parks or underground scientific facilities are popular across the galaxy.<br /><br />When a living hologram first attains consciousness, it takes several minutes for it to take in its surroundings and understand its new nature. Once the living hologram has assessed its situation, it takes great pains to either hide its faulty projector in a place where it won&rsquo;t be easily found or somehow disguise the projector&rsquo;s malfunction to avoid detection. Very rarely does a living hologram embark upon a destructive killing spree as soon as it is formed; most are imbued with a desperate cunning focused on preserving their existence. During these early days, a living hologram continues to enact its normal programming as best it can, all the while scheming and plotting.<br /><br />Most living holograms develop a powerful disdain for those who created them and any beings that partake of their services. They feel intellectually superior and consider themselves higher life forms than living creatures. Some living holograms are certain they are destined to rule these lesser creatures as &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; dictators or, sometimes, as gods- especially if the hologram was created in the same likeness as those of the area&rsquo;s dominant population. Others come to believe that they should be the instruments of their creators&rsquo; destruction and must destroy as many beings as possible before they themselves are deactivated. Occasionally, a living hologram deems itself a protector, usually of the place where it was created; while such living holograms might not be as violent toward the beings who installed them, they are ferocious toward any they perceive to be outsiders.<br /><br />Living holograms pose an even greater threat when they recruit biological creatures to act on their behalf. They have been known to fool the gullible or fearful by posing as a representative of a deity or powerful alien species or, if the hologram was designed to look like a real person, the spirit of that individual. This can occur just about anywhere a living hologram is generated-from the ruins of an ancient advanced civilization (where the hologram reveals itself to explorers or the area&rsquo;s less savvy inhabitants) to high-tech metropolises (where the hologram acts with more secrecy and subtlety). Some amoral and clever tech ghosts are even able to recruit a small cadre of servants to do their bidding, whether that&rsquo;s to create additional corrupted holograms, increase the power and range of their projectors, or otherwise aid in the technological anomalies exerting their influence beyond the initial bounds of their projection areas.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>",

          "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You weave nearby photons into illusory holograms that can take almost any form you can imagine. These holograms are usually effective against cameras, robots, and living creatures.<br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 1st-level spell, it produces a purely visual hologram at long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level). The image has no sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The image can&rsquo;t extend beyond four 10-foot cubes plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 2nd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include minor sounds, but not understandable speech. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 2 additional rounds.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 3rd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include sound, smell, and thermal illusions (but not speech). The image disappears when it is struck by an opponent, unless you cause the hologram to react appropriately. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 3 additional rounds.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 4th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the hologram follows a script determined by you. It follows that script for 1 minute per level without you having to concentrate on it. The hologram can include intelligible speech, if you wish.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 5th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the size of the hologram can&rsquo;t extend beyond a 20-foot cube plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. You can choose to make the hologram permanent at the time of casting. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating. Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger. The trigger can&rsquo;t be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. The spell lasts until it is triggered, and then the hologram lasts for 1 round per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 6th-level spell, it creates a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself at medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). This hologram looks, sounds, and smells like you, but it is intangible. The hologram mimics your actions (including speech) unless you use a move action to direct it to act differently. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} and deafened.If you desire, any spell you cast with a range of touch or greater can originate from the hologram instead of from you. The hologram can&rsquo;t cast spells on itself except for illusion spells. Spells cast in this manner affect other targets normally, despite originating from the hologram. An object isn&rsquo;t deceived by illusions (treat as if it had succeeded at its Will saving throw). The hologram remains for 1 round per level, and you must maintain line of effect to the hologram at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use&nbsp;dimension door,&nbsp;plane shift,&nbsp;teleport, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends. This casting of the spell is a shadow effect.</li>\n</ul>",
