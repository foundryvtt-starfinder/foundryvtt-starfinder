If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image.

These ideal astronomical and&nbsp;psychological conditions often birth a sombrian, a fey&nbsp;creature imbued with either the blazing energy of a star&nbsp;or the eerie light of a blood moon.</p>\n<p>Those born from a lunar eclipse are called lumyrs,&nbsp;while those born from a solar eclipse are called solmyrs.&nbsp;Both tend to resemble an intelligent species native to the&nbsp;system that birthed them. Most lumyrs have wings&nbsp;and other features reminiscent of nocturnal flying&nbsp;insects. However, their most unsettling feature&nbsp;is their apparent lack of internal organs; their&nbsp;mouths open into lightless voids, their wounds&nbsp;bleed only brief spatters of light, and their&nbsp;bodies are hollow, organ-less shells. Solmyrs’ eyes&nbsp;blaze like raging infernos and blinding light lines&nbsp;their bodies.</p>\n<p>While lumyrs are insatiably curious and hedonistic,&nbsp;solmyrs are more reclusive and less focused on the ephemeral&nbsp;amusements of their kin. Many mythologies purport that each&nbsp;solmyr is granted a piece of prophecy upon their creation, most&nbsp;often a portent or warning about their star system of origin.</p>\n<h3>JINXING WEAPONS</h3>\n<p>The same stellar events that birth sombrians leave behind&nbsp;a magical residue that serves as the foundation for sundry&nbsp;curse-based magics, including a potent weapon fusion</p>\n<p>A weapon with the jinxing weapon fusion gains the jinx critical hit effect. A target affected by the jinx critical hit effect must succeed at a Will save (DC as normal for a weapon of the given item level) or roll all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks twice and use the lower result. This effect lasts until the end of the target’s next turn. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you can choose to apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the jinx effect when you score a critical hit.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or gambol (3–6)</p>\n</section>"
