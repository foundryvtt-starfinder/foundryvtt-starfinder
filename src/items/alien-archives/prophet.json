If the target’s soul is not willing to return, the spell fails; therefore, a target that wants to return receives no saving throw. Casting this spell requires a special monument worth at least 1,000 credits to serve as a beacon for the departed creature’s soul.

The condition of the creature’s remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete.

It retains any class features, feats, and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and Hit Points are unchanged.

The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level, it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page.

The second option is to bring a target that died within 2 rounds back to life. In addition to healing such a creature, the spell returns the target to life, and the target takes a temporary negative level for 24 hours. This spell can’t resuscitate creatures slain by death effects, creatures turned into undead, or creatures whose bodies were destroyed, significantly mutilated, disintegrated, and so on.</p>\n<p>Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"

Religious figures don’t just lead the devout; they often also steer nonreligious discourse. Depending on their congregation and ambitions, the leader might even overshadow the government of a city or planet. Although this arrangement might bring peace, it could as easily realize a terrible regime of divine tyranny or terror.</p><h3>PROPHET</h3><p>Prophets are chosen by the gods to foretell the future, though they rarely have a choice in the matter. Their prophecies manifest as waking visions, astrological readings, cosmic energy pulses, or even direct conversations with their deities. While some prophets embrace their gift and serve as impartial messengers, others become overwhelmed by their prophecies, either in the hope of bringing their visions to fruition or in an attempt to stop some unfavorable future. These prophets often fall victim to exploitative opportunists who try to use them as a tool to foresee and manipulate the future.</p>",
