        "value": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The horrific creature known as a living apocalypse is created when the most powerful destructive energies known to the galaxy are unleashed without constraint or limitation, especially in acts of malice or as a result of criminal negligence. A living apocalypse can be the result of powerful energy generators melting down, the use of doomsday weapons, or even magic experimentation gone horribly awry. The creature is driven by an instinctive need to destroy, and it often takes the form of a massive cloud of impenetrable oily smoke, lit from within by pulsing bolts of green radioactive discharge. A living apocalypse is drawn to high concentrations of life and complex structures, from vibrant rainforests to bustling cities, and attacks them without warning or remorse. Though mindless, a living apocalypse is driven by a supernatural force of anarchic evil to enact ruin. It has been suggested that a living apocalypse is an agent of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG]{The Devourer}, but even if this is true, Devourer cultists are incapable of intentionally creating or controlling them. Some lifeless worlds are the burned-out remains of civilizations that created a living apocalypse and were totally destroyed by it.<br /><br />As a creature that is infused with incredible destructive energies, a living apocalypse commands energy rays of pure radioactive force and powerful magic abilities it can employ with instinctual cunning. Though it is unable to form complex plans or comprehend complex chains of cause and effect, a living apocalypse is able to apply its ability to manipulate energy to deal with immediate threats with what seem like carefully considered tactics. Once a living apocalypse is unleashed in a region, it destroys everything in its path until there is not a complex structure or significant life-form left within hundreds of miles. Because it is mindless, the ooze follows a path dictated by what it can sense at any given moment. If it can&rsquo;t detect anything nearby, it settles in one place, using its broadcast ability both to listen for wireless signals and to send signals out in the hopes of drawing in more victims.<br /><br />When there is nothing left to destroy and no change for centuries, a living apocalypse eventually goes into a dormant state, often at the bottom of a chasm or within the stormiest region of a world, waiting for centuries for someone to find it. A typical living apocalypse is 30 feet in diameter and weighs 187 tons.<br /><br /><strong>Apocalypse Crystals</strong><br />Regions ravaged by a living apocalypse&rsquo;s radioactivity sometimes develop a form of natural solarian weapon crystal known as an apocalypse crystal. While no one is foolish enough to oppose a living apocalypse to search its environs for these crystals, when a living apocalypse moves away from a devastated area it dwelt in for a long period, there is often a &ldquo;crystal rush.&rdquo; Representatives of solarian academies and other prospectors in environmental suits risk exposure to lingering radiation in hopes of finding any apocalypse crystals before anyone else-and before the malevolent nuclear ooze returns.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>",

You must conjure the singularity in a square that is unoccupied by any creatures or objects. When you finish casting this spell, the singularity immediately draws all Medium and smaller creatures and unattended objects of no more than light bulk within 30 feet toward it. Each round on your turn, the singularity makes a single special combat maneuver against creatures within 30 feet with an attack bonus equal to 4 + your caster level + your key ability modifier. Compare the result to each creature’s KAC + 8. If the singularity is successful, that creature is moved 5 feet toward the singularity plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds a target’s KAC + 8. Unattended objects are automatically moved 10 feet toward the singularity each round. If a creature or object is moved into the square that contains the singularity, it is sucked inside it and takes 12d6 damage at the end of its turn each round it remains within that space.<br><br>A creature drawn into the singularity can take no actions except a full action to try to escape (it still takes damage during the rounds it attempts to escape). A creature must succeed at either an Athletics check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your mystic level) or a DC 22 Strength check to escape the singularity. The singularity can hold up to four Medium creatures or objects (two Small creatures or objects count as one Medium creature, and so on); if it would pull in additional creatures, those creatures are simply pulled into a square adjacent to the singularity.<br><br>A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However, it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement, it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.<br><br>When this spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can’t all fit within it).</p>",

You choose to use <em>greater dispel magic</em> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counter.<br /><br /><strong>Targeted Dispel</strong>: This functions as a targeted <em>dispel magic</em>, but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have, attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally, <em>greater dispel magic</em> has a chance to dispel any curse that <em>remove affliction</em> can remove, even if <em>dispel magic</em> can&rsquo;t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse&rsquo;s DC.<br /><br /><strong>Area Dispel</strong>: When <em>greater dispel magic</em> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area, as if it were targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>. If you don&rsquo;t specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl01_LabelName\">For each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the <em>greater dispel magic</em> spell, apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by&nbsp;dispel magic.&nbsp;Dispel magic&nbsp;can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled.<br /><br />You choose to use&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;in one of two ways: as a targeted dispel or as a counter.<br /><br /><strong>Targeted Dispel</strong>: One creature, object, or spell is the target of the&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as&nbsp;zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as &ldquo;that burning wall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spell that&rsquo;s giving him those duplicates&rdquo;). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends. If you don&rsquo;t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.<br /><br />If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br /><br />If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item&rsquo;s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed&nbsp;holy laser pistol&nbsp;is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br /><br />You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.<br /><br /><strong>Counter</strong>: You can use the energy of&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster&rsquo;s caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range, the spell fails and has no result.</p>",

Depending on your desired effect (choose one from below), the spell can perform a variety of combat maneuvers, provide a gentle, sustained force, or exert a single short, violent thrust.<br><br><strong>Combat Maneuver:</strong> Once per round, you can use&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal, but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating.<br><br><strong>Sustained Force:</strong> A sustained force moves an object of no more than 25 pounds or 2 bulk per caster level up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell’s range.<br><br>You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example, a lever can be pulled, a key turned, a button pushed, an object rotated, and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.<br><br><strong>Violent Thrust:</strong> The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects, such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect, as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a thrown creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 1d6 damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.</p>",

Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet’s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br><br>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10–1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br><br><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br><br><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “mishap” comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\"><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Very familiar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Studied carefully</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">95–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Seen casually</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">89–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">95–98</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">99–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Viewed once</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–76</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">77–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">89–96</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">97–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">False destination</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">81–92</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">93–100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each subsequent round. In addition, the wall deals 5d6 fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.<br><br>If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 or more cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away.</p>",
