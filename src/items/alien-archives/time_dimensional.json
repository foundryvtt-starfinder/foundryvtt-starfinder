        "value": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Time dimensionals are living fragments of the Dimension of Time, the mysterious demiplane that seems to act as the focal point for the entire flow of time throughout existence. These creatures are seemingly created whenever an event or individual threatens the nature of causality or the flow of time. Time dimensionals act as corrective agents on behalf of the dimension, confronting and neutralizing threats to the timestream. This action can take a variety of forms, ranging from the destruction of the offending target to altering the memories and motives of specific individuals to delaying events until the self-correcting power of time can resolve any discrepancies. In situations of great disruption, the Dimension of Time will dispatch several dimensionals at once to work in conjunction to preserve the timestream.<br><br>Due to the fragile nature of causality, the Dimension of Time creates time dimensionals in only the most necessary scenarios. The dimension’s discretion confounds scholars as the situations that require a time dimensional’s presence seem inconsistent. Some seemingly mundane circumstances, such as the uneventful passage of a Vercite transport through @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} in 303 ag, have caused the appearance of a time dimensional. Meanwhile, events that seem like an obvious beacon for time dimensionals, like the Veskarium research vessel that used a black hole to alter its relative time flow to quickly advance weapons technology in 296 ag, garnered no attention from the creatures whatsoever.<br><br>The appearance of a time dimensional varies between each noted sighting and from dimensional to dimensional. The most common appearance is that of a lanky humanoid approximately 12 feet tall formed from myriad crystal facets. Other times, the crystal appears smoother, taking on the appearance of polished glass, while sometimes the shape is wholly translucent. Regardless of a time dimensional’s shape, images of events throughout time, including past, present, and possible future events, constantly flicker within the creature’s body.<br><br>Time dimensionals share a portion of the powers of the Dimension of Time and are capable of manipulating the flow of time in a localized area. This allows a time dimensional to lock a creature out of time’s progression or advance the flow of time on an item so quickly that it crumbles to dust. Additionally, this ability grants a time dimensional superior control over its temporal position, allowing it to move around a battlefield in the blink of an eye. This free access to the flow of time also allows a time dimensional to tap into its own past and future knowledge at any time.<br><br>Scholars’ fascination with both the Dimension of Time and its native creatures has led several theories throughout history. Some say the existence of time dimensionals in the first place implies a measure of inherent sapience to the Dimension of Time, as few other planes would be capable of creating such creatures, let alone dispatching them with such precision. A few esoteric sages believe that, despite the differing appearance of some dimensionals, only a single time dimensional exists: a creature whose form becomes smoother as its existence progresses, perhaps due to constant creation and reabsorption of the creature by the Dimension of Time. If true, this lone dimensional must be crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself and working in tandem with them to enact the dimension’s will.<br><br>Beyond collecting small amounts of temporal residue left behind by destroyed time dimensionals, any attempt to access the power of time dimensionals is futile. Researchers who have attempted to use time travel to return to lost Golarion or other notable points throughout history have vanished entirely or, as rumors persist, encountered an exceptionally rare and powerful time dimensional that removed the individual from time entirely, erasing any evidence of the victim’s existence. Skeptics are quick to point out that even if such a thing occurred, no one would actually know about it. Even if a chronal scientist doesn’t draw the ire of the Dimension of Time, they run the risk of attracting a hound of Tindalos, a terrifying danger in its own right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Dimension of Time)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or chronology (3-12)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>",

          "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell functions as&nbsp;teleport, except there is no hard range limit and you don’t need to have seen your destination. You can teleport to anywhere you are familiar with on the planet you are on while casting the spell, or you can teleport to any other planet in the same solar system. You must have an unambiguous idea of which world you wish to travel to (“the third planet from the sun” is an acceptable destination, but “a habitable world with oceans” is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise, you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell simply fails.<br><br>You can also attempt to teleport to planets in different solar systems that you have visited before. This increases the casting time to 1 hour and costs a number of Resolve Points equal to the number of days it would take to reach the planet through Drift travel (assume a base engine with a Drift rating of 1; the GM rolls this randomly, after you begin casting the spell). If you don’t have enough Resolve Points, you spend all the Resolve Points you have available and the spell fails.</p>",

If several willing or unconscious creatures are linked by hand in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by a single casting of&nbsp;plane shift. Arriving at a precise location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane (except for @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}), though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from the last place one of the targets (your choice) was located last time that target traveled to that plane. If it’s the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane, though you can use other means of transit, such as&nbsp;interplanetary teleport, to travel on the new plane. Mystics must have an object attuned to a specific plane or native to that plane in order to use&nbsp;plane shift&nbsp;to travel to a plane. A technomancer requires a planar navigational program for a specific plane in order to travel to that plane with&nbsp;plane shift. Special rituals, jealously hoarded by powerful technomancers and mystics, can allow you to travel to specific locations on the chosen plane, or even to unknown worlds.</p>",
