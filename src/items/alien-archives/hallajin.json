Most of the time, these shapes look like shifting multicolored masses of light, though sometimes hints of feathery wings, scaly coils, staring eyes, or writhing tendrils emerge from within their depths. These forms were initially believed to be just strange lights seen in the sky of Hallas, perhaps an aurora or a type of ball lightning related to the storms of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ac6z5Rqyx0oLzvVf]{Liavara}, but visitors to the moon quickly learned they were intelligent&mdash;if inscrutable&mdash;creatures, though that knowledge came at a high price. The creatures are able to communicate telepathically, but when the first emissaries from nearby Arkanen attempted to contact them in the same manner, the experience seared the emissaries&rsquo; minds. This led to the establishment of a powerful magical cordon around the world&mdash;one that remains in place to this day, now administrated by Pact Worlds officials on nearby Arkanen to ensure unprepared visitors don&rsquo;t accidentally destroy their minds or anger the powerful entities.<br /><br />Study of ancient ruins and artifacts on Hallas by modern archaeological and paleobiological teams has contributed to the belief that the so-called hallajins (their name for themselves is unknown) once had material forms but developed beyond the need for them and became beings of pure energy. Examination of the surviving art and artifacts on Hallas suggests hallajins considered their small world the center of the universe, with other worlds and stars revolving around it, and saw the idea of leaving it as heresy. This may explain why hallajins are rarely seen away from Hallas. Though actual answers are few, historians believe that those occasional hallajins sighted on other worlds may be descendants of an ancient schism in their society that happened before the Gap or the establishment of the protective cordon.<br /><br />Hallajins can use their light leap ability to appear and vanish at will, fly swiftly, pass through material barriers, and cross vast distances in the blink of an eye. Early adepts of Arkanen discovered that hallajins either will not or cannot pass through intense electrical fields, and they found that electricity appears to cause hallajins pain&mdash; or at least that they recoil from it. Researchers theorize that electricity interferes in some way with the creatures&rsquo; energy matrices. This weakness provides a means of shielding against hallajin intrusions, although intense electrical energy fields also appear to draw the creatures&rsquo; attention, perhaps being especially visible to their senses. Large concentrations of minds, particularly emotional ones, seem to likewise draw the creatures, and researchers must keep their minds carefully shielded with specialized armor or magical protections.<br /><br />What hallajins want, if anything, is unclear. The little of their culture recovered from ancient ruins and brief interactions indicates that their advancement to their current form was part of an intentional cultural drive to attempt to reach collective godhood. Whether the creatures intentionally stopped at their current state or simply couldn&rsquo;t progress any further remains unknown. Today, hallajins appear capricious and intensely curious, and their behavior is unpredictable. They are almost always encountered singly, although small groups of them have been sighted in the distance on Hallas. Yet despite their apparently solitary behavior, they remain in near-constant communication with others of their kind across vast distances. They don&rsquo;t appear to understand or respond to any known spoken languages, and attempts to contact them telepathically usually end in disaster. The hallajins sometimes initiate contact, telepathically &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; in an unsettling chorus of voices to their listeners, but rarely say anything intelligible. Hallajins occasionally follow visitors to their home planets, exercising their telekinetic abilities to shift objects around or cause random poltergeistlike phenomena, sometimes dangerously. In a few cases, the energy beings turn suddenly hostile, attacking with bursts of searing energy or overloading victims&rsquo; minds. Interestingly, hallajins appear incapable of recognizing mechanical constructs as anything but objects, even if such creatures are intelligent.<br /><br />The unexplained behavior, strange powers, and eerie appearance of hallajins lead some intelligent creatures to revere them as examples of universal forces or enlightened beings. A few visiting scholars have started single-minded cults around the creatures, believing that hallajins hold the secrets to assisting corporeal beings in attaining a similarly evolved state, if only they can be persuaded to share them. Some think this is accomplished by attracting the attention of the lights of Hallas, and then communing and proving their worthiness in some fashion, while others think they can trick or even force the secret from hallajins. Hallajin cults tend to be obsessed with ancient artifacts from Hallas and strange electrical mechanisms designed to summon, communicate with, or even trap the objects of their worship. Though many fear the consequences of allowing such groups contact with the creatures, so far the Pact Worlds overseers have continued to grant these fanatics unrestricted access to Hallas.<br /><br />Due to their aberrant anatomy, it is incredibly difficult to determine the average size of a hallajin. Most scientists posit that they range from 14 to 20 feet in length and, as beings of energy, weigh next to nothing</span></p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>",

A creature or object within the area that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected (though if it stays in the area, it must succeed at a new save each round or become affected), but it might still suffer secondary effects (such as an object flying up from reversed gravity, or an object falling upon it when the spell ends). You choose how to have this spell affect gravity when you cast it, and you cannot change it without recasting the spell. If two <em>control gravity</em> spells affect the same area, they negate each other in the area of overlap.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If you reverse gravity in an area, you cause unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the affected area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the spell’s area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell’s duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling in either direction.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If you increase gravity in the area, creatures and objects weigh twice as much as normal, move at half speed, can jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">An area of zero-g works like the zero-g environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero-g, heavy gravity, or light gravity act as normal gravity for the duration (see page 402).</span></p>",

You must conjure the singularity in a square that is unoccupied by any creatures or objects. When you finish casting this spell, the singularity immediately draws all Medium and smaller creatures and unattended objects of no more than light bulk within 30 feet toward it. Each round on your turn, the singularity makes a single special combat maneuver against creatures within 30 feet with an attack bonus equal to 4 + your caster level + your key ability modifier. Compare the result to each creature’s KAC + 8. If the singularity is successful, that creature is moved 5 feet toward the singularity plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result exceeds a target’s KAC + 8. Unattended objects are automatically moved 10 feet toward the singularity each round. If a creature or object is moved into the square that contains the singularity, it is sucked inside it and takes 12d6 damage at the end of its turn each round it remains within that space.<br><br>A creature drawn into the singularity can take no actions except a full action to try to escape (it still takes damage during the rounds it attempts to escape). A creature must succeed at either an Athletics check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your mystic level) or a DC 22 Strength check to escape the singularity. The singularity can hold up to four Medium creatures or objects (two Small creatures or objects count as one Medium creature, and so on); if it would pull in additional creatures, those creatures are simply pulled into a square adjacent to the singularity.<br><br>A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However, it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement, it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.<br><br>When this spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can’t all fit within it).</p>",

Depending on your desired effect (choose one from below), the spell can perform a variety of combat maneuvers, provide a gentle, sustained force, or exert a single short, violent thrust.<br><br><strong>Combat Maneuver:</strong> Once per round, you can use&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal, but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating.<br><br><strong>Sustained Force:</strong> A sustained force moves an object of no more than 25 pounds or 2 bulk per caster level up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell’s range.<br><br>You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example, a lever can be pulled, a key turned, a button pushed, an object rotated, and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.<br><br><strong>Violent Thrust:</strong> The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects, such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect, as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a thrown creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes 1d6 damage as if it had fallen 10 feet.</p>",

For confused creatures that have not been attacked, roll on the following table at the start of each affected creature’s turn each round to see what it does in that round.</span></p>\n<table style=\"width: 403px; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; background-color: #34495e; text-align: center; width: 44px;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">D%</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 352px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Behavior</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 44px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">1-25</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 352px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Act normally</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 44px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">26-50</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 352px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Do nothing but babble incoherently</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 44px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">51-75</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 352px; text-align: center; background-color: #7e8c8d;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Deal 1d8 + Str modifier damage to self with item in hand</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 44px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\">76-100</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 352px; text-align: center; background-color: #34495e;\">\n<p style=\"color: white;\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Attack nearest creature</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">A confused creature that can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.

If it fails, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers however it chooses and you believe that wrong answer to be the truth. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly into your mind. You and the target don’t need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate sensory images in answer to your questions.</p>",
