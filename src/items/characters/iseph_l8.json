You’re a consummate professional, and you always get the job done, whether it’s scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing and smuggling items, or assassinating key figures. As an operative, you’re skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and use speed, mobility, and your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons. You excel at the art of surprise, whether it’s sniping targets from cover or striking while their backs are turned. Your cause may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting dirty—achieving your objective is all that matters.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.a65jtTCCb5kXCz5v]{Operative's Edge (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your diverse training as an operative grants you a +1 insight bonus to initiative checks and to skill checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PU3uwrAcmGXMGo2n]{Specialization - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Your specialization represents your primary area of expertise. Pick one specialization upon taking your 1st level of the operative class. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the specializations appear on page 94. Your specialization grants you the Skill Focus feat (see page 161) in your specialization’s associated skills, and you gain a free skill rank in each of those skills at each operative level (this does not allow you to exceed the maximum number of skill ranks in a single skill).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{Trick Attack (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization; see page 94) with a DC equal to 20 + your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is flat-footed. This damage increases to 1d8 at 3rd level, to 3d8 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d8 every 2 levels thereafter. You can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.EpLSSSdLcqVQKcSM]{Evasion (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect. You gain this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and you lose the benefit when you are helpless or otherwise unable to move.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.On2ZrPJTe8FURsXY]{Operative Exploit - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn special tricks called operative exploits. You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and you learn an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. If an operative exploit allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. The list of operative exploits appears on page 95. You cannot learn the same exploit more than once unless it specially says otherwise.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cymsh0UZpmJB0cQK]{Quick Movement (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As long as you are unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, your land speed increases by 10 feet. At 9th level, your land speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 15th level, your land speed instead increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.seLibYiTN2eBls2s]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.bhSrjkuWxz2DQHXC]{Debilitating Trick (Ex) - 4th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can make the creature flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of your next turn. You might learn exploits that grant you additional options for your debilitating trick, but you can select only one option each time you hit with a trick attack.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.TpIFhqDUrNkdiEk0]{Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn’t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you’re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don’t provide any advantage against you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.YXdfeYmufD6OWP7J]{Triple Attack (Ex) - 8th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.scbcE4mjiHoNK7Wi]{Quad Attack (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to four attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.jd4qWJS9qElePrhf]{Double Debilitation (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can apply two of the effects from your debilitating trick.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.z736GBR6XdcqIaTT]{Supreme Operative (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; Whenever you attempt a skill check with your specialization’s associated skills, you can roll twice and take the higher result. Once per day as a move action, you can temporarily trade out one of your operative exploits for another operative exploit requiring the same level or lower. This trade lasts 24 hours. If the exploit you trade away is a prerequisite for any of your other abilities, you lose all abilities that require it as a prerequisite for the duration.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.nWQDB336Ql0GoulS]{Marked for Death (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.wk7Xp5wzUdELgTel]{Stunt and Strike (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.r39XH26A7uPeF6XZ]{Quick Cover (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.2gwyI9ZufT3XkxrD]{Quick Trick (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.inAh60LBh9qBhRKU]{Quick Zero-G Adaptation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.im0yTfz7hjLT7u4E]{Operative’s Arsenal (Ex)}</p>"

You might be a member of an elite military force, the recipient of intense courses of training. Alternatively, you might be a total amateur with innate skills that make you a much-admired hotshot.</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)</h2>\n<p>You are obsessed with starships and vehicles, and have committed to memory almost every related tidbit of knowledge you’ve ever come across. Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about starship and vehicle models and parts as well as famous hotshot pilots by 5. Piloting is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to your Piloting checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Dexterity at character creation.</p>\n<h2>LONE WOLF (6TH)</h2>\n<p>You know at least a little bit about handling every role on a starship, and you can sub in for certain tasks in a pinch. Whenever you need to attempt a skill check either during starship combat or to directly repair or otherwise maintain your starship, you can treat half your ranks in Piloting as your ranks in the appropriate skill for the check, if that would be better (since you effectively have ranks in the related skill, you are considered trained in the skill for the purposes of this check).</p>\n<h2>NEED FOR SPEED (12TH)</h2>\n<p>Speeding in a vehicle gives you a heady rush, and you can easily handle operating vehicles at high velocities that might send lesser pilots spinning out of control. Reduce any penalties to Piloting checks you make when on a vehicle by 1. When you take the double maneuver action during a vehicle chase (see page 283), reduce the penalty for each action by 1. Whenever a Piloting check has a penalty for failing by 5 or more, you take that penalty only if you fail by 10 or more.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MASTER PILOT (18TH)</h2>\n<p>Your piloting accomplishments invigorate you, giving you renewed purpose and zeal. Up to twice per day, when you defeat a significant foe in starship combat as a pilot or succeed in a vehicle chase (meaning that you’ve either escaped a pursuer or caught or defeated your opponent), you recover 1 Resolve Point.</p>"

          "value": "<p>Complex technological creations crafted to resemble @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, androids were originally a servitor race, but they have since broken free to form their own society. Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls—a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Androids are biomechanical constructs created in technological crèches called foundries. While the first androids are believed to have been mostly biological, difficult to distinguish from the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} they lived among, modern designs are more varied, and many favor metal skeletons and processors that support synthetic organs and living flesh. Nearly all androids feature a humanoid body shape and tattoo-like circuits that glow through their skin when operating at full power, but beyond this commonality, variations in physical appearance reflect an android’s design, role, and personality. Some take pains to blend into @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} society, while others deliberately display their mechanical nature. Though some androids are constructed or customize themselves to look like other races, such models are relatively rare. Due to their biological components, androids need to eat and sleep, but as constructed beings they do not reproduce in the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} fashion and have no biological need for gender—some identify strongly as male or female, while others shift fluidly or ignore it altogether, and still others actively reject it on philosophical grounds as a relic of their former slavery.</p>\n<p>Though android bodies are assembled using tiny machines called nanites, their complex nervous systems attract and integrate souls in the same way organic creatures do. Most androids are fully grown at the time of their birth, and can technically live forever through constant repair, though most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so to allow new souls to inhabit them—a process called renewal that’s viewed more as procreation than suicide.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Android technology in the Pact Worlds is generally believed to have developed on Golarion in the time before the Gap, though there are strong indications that the first androids there were actually travelers from a distant star system. In the modern era, various corporations throughout the Pact Worlds system unraveled the secret to android creation and began massproducing androids as cheap, skilled labor perfect for hazardous work. This practice lasted until about 150 years ago, when the Thyst Rebellion and subsequent android revolts across the system, combined with the now legendary speech known as “The Automaton’s Polemic” by android revolutionary Serphaeus-6, led governments system-wide to officially recognize all androids as independent citizens. This ruling, however, has not completely stopped unscrupulous corporations in less regulated parts of the system from crafting illegal android slaves or forcing newborn androids to “work off” the expense of their creation. Though androids can be found anywhere in the Pact Worlds, many gravitate toward cosmopolitan @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the machine cities of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon}, and the freedom of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Android society tends to be insular. While androids are treated equitably in most settlements, especially @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, many androids have not forgotten their people’s bondage and remain keenly aware of prejudice from other races based on their “unnatural” origin or jealousy over the androids’ freedom from aging. This leads most androids to feel a sense of kinship with others of their kind and to go out of their way to help each other, though they may also bond with members of other races who treat them well. Despite popular belief, androids’ impressive deductive reasoning abilities do not preclude sentiment, and most androids feel emotions keenly—they simply don’t always express them well, and different individuals may have trouble processing and communicating particular feelings. The average android alignment is a practical neutrality; they are focused on their own welfare and that of their friends.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Often cautious around strangers, androids have the most strained relationship with humanity, which built them in its image and remains their most frequent oppressor. They feel closest to shirrens, who also know what it is to be enslaved and misunderstood, and respect kasathas’ self-sufficiency. They generally dislike @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk}, whom they see as slavers, and only grudgingly tolerate ysoki’s antics.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Androids adventure for many reasons: to earn a living, trace the origins of their race, or rescue androids and other creatures from servitude. Their quick thinking under fire makes them natural operatives and soldiers, while their affinity for machines makes them excellent mechanics and technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Cha</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong> 5-7 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong> 100-200 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>—</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age</strong> See Android entry</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Androids are Medium humanoids with the android subtype.</p>\n<h2>Constructed</h2>\n<p>For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. In addition, androids do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Exceptional Vision</h2>\n<p>Androids have darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. See pages 263–264 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Flat Affect</h2>\n<p>Androids find emotions confusing and keep them bottled up. They take a –2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, but the DCs of Sense Motive checks attempted against them increase by 2.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade Slot</h2>\n<p>Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em></p>\n<p>Most androids have the standard android racial traits detailed in the&nbsp;Core Rulebook, but individuals might have unique abilities, represented by the following alternate racial traits.</p>\n<h2>Easily Augmented</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em></p>\n<p>As artificial creatures, androids are compatible with a wide array of cybernetics. Androids who have this racial trait can install one additional cybernetic augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Impersonation Matrix</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em></p>\n<p>Although most androids stand out as artificial beings, some have intricate personality matrices and physical alterations that downplay their constructed nature. Androids who have this alternate racial trait don’t take any penalty to Disguise checks to change their appearance to a creature of a different race or type if they are disguising themselves as a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}. If the android also has the xenometric android alternate racial trait (see page 17), this benefit instead applies to Disguise checks to change appearance to that of the race chosen along with the xenometric android alternate racial trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces the +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep from the constructed trait. The android retains all the other features of the constructed trait.</p>\n<h2>Infosphere Integration</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 16</em></p>\n<p>The artificial brain an android possesses can allow better compatibility with infospheres and direct downloads of information. An android with this trait has a built-in comm unit that can be accessed without needing to use their hands. Once per day, whenever the android takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points, they can choose one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill. The chosen skill becomes a class skill for them, and they gain Skill Focus as a bonus feat with that skill. This decision lasts until the next time the android uses this trait.</p>\n<p>This replaces exceptional vision.</p>\n<h2>Multilingual</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em></p>\n<p>New languages are easy for some androids to learn. An android with this racial trait knows four additional languages at 1st level. In addition, whenever such an android invests a skill rank into Culture, they learn two new languages instead of one.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Nanite Upgrade</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 17</em></p>\n<p>Specialized nanites maintain an android body, but they can be upgraded to perform additional tasks. Androids who have this racial trait gain Nanite integration as a bonus feat, ignoring the feat’s prerequisites.</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot.</p>\n<h2>Xenometric Android</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>COM pg. 17</em></p>\n<p>Although most androids are manufactured to resemble @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, those crafted in the likenesses of other species exist. Such “xenometrics” possess abilities that mirror those of other races, sometimes even using hybrid tech to duplicate magic abilities.</p>\n<p>An android with this trait selects one of the species detailed in the paragraphs below. This choice cannot be changed. In addition to possessing physical features resembling those of the chosen species, the android’s size category and reach changes to match the chosen race. In addition, xenometric androids gain some of the chosen species’ racial traits, which are noted in parentheses next to the race’s name; these count as racial traits for the purposes of prerequisites. If a gained racial trait determines land speed, the android uses the speed as defined by that racial trait instead of that of the android. If the chosen species has a different type than humanoid, the xenometric android’s type changes to match.</p>\n<p>Starfinder Core Rulebook options are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf} (darkvision, slow but steady), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf} (elven immunities, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} (@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} magic, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf} (adaptability, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} (darkvision, intimidating, self-sufficient), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling} (keen senses, sneaky, sure-footed), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} (four-armed, natural grace), lashunta (lashunta magic, limited telepathy), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} (blindsense, limited telepathy), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} (low-light vision, natural weapons), and ysoki (cheek pouches, darkvision).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive options are dragonkin (draconic immunities, flight), formian (limited telepathy, natural weapons), haan (firespray, slow fall), kalo (kalo movement, kalo vision), maraquoi (blindsense, prehensile tail), nuar (natural weapons, swift), verthani (skill focus, skin mimic), and wrikreechee (snag, wrikreechee movement).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive 2 options are hobgoblin (fearsome, sneaky), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} (fierce survivalist, orc ferocity), pahtra (nimble, talented), and vlaka (cold resistance, perceptive).</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Pact Worlds option is the strix (nightborn, strix mobility).</p>\n<p>This replaces upgrade slot and exceptional vision.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Iseph awoke in a black-market renewal crèche on Aballon. Around them, the dingy warehouse was completely empty, save for a pen and a note in the center of the concrete floor. Clearly hastily scrawled, the note read only: Run. Hide. Retaliate. Beware the mark. Next to the words was a drawing of a symbol—the same inexplicable design branded on Iseph’s chest. Yet the biggest shock was when Iseph picked up the pen, as the note’s writer had clearly intended—for the handwriting on the note matched Iseph’s own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Confused and disoriented, Iseph did as the note instructed, doing their best to disappear into Aballon’s bustling android population. Yet the questions raised by the note continued to plague them. Who had worn their body before them? Who were they running from, and why? Eventually, Iseph began making inquiries. All of these searches failed, yet in curious ways, as if the information was being actively redacted. Worse, Iseph began to get the sense of being watched. After a month of forays into they city’s underworld, Iseph at last tracked down someone who claimed to recognize the mark, but who insisted on meeting in person at a nearby virus bar.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Iseph was almost to the tavern when it exploded in a massive fireball, the blast consuming an entire city block.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thoroughly spooked, Iseph fled Aballon, taking passage on a ship to the Diaspora. Yet as they worked there, piloting rock-hopper shuttles and mining tugs, Iseph’s fear turned to anger. They met android escapees from illegal colonies in the Vast, bearing blatant symbols of corporate ownership and scars from cruel disciplinary implants, and began to suspect what their own mark might say about their origins. Incensed, Iseph made contact with the Android Abolitionist Front, and under their guidance became a black ops expert. Eventually a disagreement with their handler over a messy job led Iseph to go independent. Today, Iseph hires on with freelancer crews as an elite pilot specializing in dangerous transport or exploratory missions—and if those jobs sometimes require a little infiltration or a bullet from the shadows, well, that costs extra.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Though paranoia often makes Iseph a loner, the android craves companionship, and is fiercely loyal to those who prove themselves trustworthy. Iseph questions or rejects many aspects of mainstream Pact Worlds culture, and enjoys exploring the countercultures on different worlds. Iseph believes the ends often justify the means, yet strives to only take on jobs that fit their sense of morality, and an initial focus on android rights has broadened into a tendency to identify with oppressed people everywhere. While Iseph finds the most joy in flying vehicles—usually fast and recklessly—their infiltration abilities remain sharp, and the former assassin has no objections to pulling out their sniper rifle when a cause is just.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloaking Field (Ex)</strong> As a move action, Iseph can activate their cloaking field, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks even when being directly observed and with no place to hide. If Iseph remains perfectly still, they gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which does not stack with invisibility) until they move. This cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, it recharges 1 round of use per minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Constructed</strong> For effects targeting creatures by type, Iseph counts as both a construct and a humanoid (whichever is worse for Iseph).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision Iseph</strong> can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Debilitating Trick (Ex)</strong> When Iseph hits an enemy with his trick attack, Iseph can choose to make that enemy either flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of Iseph’s next turn. Iseph can instead apply the effect of interfering shot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dive for Cover</strong> When Iseph attempts a Reflex save against an area attack or area effect, they can choose to fall prone in an adjacent space in order to roll the saving throw twice, taking the better of the two results.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong> If Iseph succeeds at a Reflex save against an effect that has a partial effect on a successful save, they instead suffer no effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flat Affect</strong> The DC of a Sense Motive check attempted against Iseph increases by 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Interfering Shot (Ex)</strong> Iseph adds being able to prevent a target from using reactions until the end of Iseph’s next turn to the list of effects they can apply with the debilitating trick ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kip&nbsp;Up</strong> Iseph can stand from prone as a swift action, rather than a move action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Multi-Weapon</strong> Fighting When Iseph makes a full attack with two or more operative melee weapons or small arms, reduce the penalty to each attack from –4 to –3.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lone Wolf</strong> When attempting a check using a skill they have no ranks in as part of a role in starship combat, or to directly repair their own ship, Iseph can act as if they had 4 ranks in that skill (gaining the ability to attempt the check if the skill requires training, the +3 bonus from being trained, and the +4 bonus to the check for having 4 ranks).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong> Iseph can see in dim light as if it was normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sky Jockey</strong> When Iseph uses a device to fly, their fly speed is increased by 10 feet (this is already incorporated into the stat block). If Iseph operates a flying vehicle, its fly speed increases by 10. When they are in the pilot role of a starship, the starship’s speed increases by 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Specialization Skill Mastery</strong> When Iseph attempts an Acrobatics or Stealth check, they can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent them from doing so.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trick Attack</strong> As a full action, Iseph can move up to 40 feet and make a single attack with a small arm (or a melee weapon with the operative special property) as a trick attack. Just before making the attack, Iseph attempts a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (whichever is better for Iseph) with a DC equal to 20 + the target’s CR. If the skill check is successful, the attack deals 4d8 additional damage and the target is flat-footed against this attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Triple Attack</strong> When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, Iseph can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Agility (Ex)</strong> Iseph is immune to the flat-footed condition, opponents do not gain any bonuses to attack rolls for flanking Iseph or attacking when Iseph is prone, and covering fire and harrying fire to not provide any bonuses against Iseph.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Pilot (Ex)</strong> When Iseph attacks while driving a vehicle, they take only half the vehicle’s normal penalty to their attack roll. When in a chase, Iseph gains a +2 bonus to skill checks when attempting the evade or trick pilot actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Uncanny Shooter (Ex)</strong> Iseph doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with small arms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Upgrade Slot</strong> Iseph has an internal quick-release sheath normally installed in armor as an upgrade. This can store a single one-handed weapon, which Iseph can draw as a swift action.</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Advanced Lashunta Tempweave</strong> While wearing this armor, Iseph can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (and other harsh environments) for up to 8 days. The armor has jump jets as an upgrade, allowing Iseph to fly up to 40 feet as part of a move action. At the end of this flight, Iseph must land or they fall. Iseph can do this 10 times before the jump jets’ battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Advanced Semi-Auto Pistol</strong> This weapon fires physical bullets and can be fired 12 times before it must be reloaded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Advanced Shirren-Eye Rifle</strong> This sniper rifle fires physical projectiles and can be fired four times before it must be reloaded. It can be used to make only a single attack each round. If it is aimed as a move action and then fired as a standard action, it has a 500-foot range increment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ghost Killer Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This weapon creates damaging waves of sonic energy and can be fired 10 times before its battery must be recharged or replaced. It has been given the ghost killer infusion, which allows it to damage ethereal and incorporeal targets normally and allows incorporeal creatures to pick it up and use it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch</strong> Iseph can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Ampule of Lesser Restoration</strong> Iseph can inject this magic liquid into themselves or an unconscious or willing creature as a standard action. The subject is affected by lesser restoration, healing 1d4 temporary ability damage and eliminating the fatigued condition (or lessening the exhausted condition to fatigued).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Titanium Alloy Cable</strong> This 50-foot-long cable is designed for climbing or securing loose cargo.&nbsp;</p>",
