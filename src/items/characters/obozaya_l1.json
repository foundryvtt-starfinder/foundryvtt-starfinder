        "value": "<p>Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. She quickly established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo soon proved herself in several battles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connections. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit&mdash;one with family ties to high-ranking military officials&mdash;she found herself assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for combat. When it became clear that appeals to her superiors weren&rsquo;t going to get her a better assignment, a frustrated Obozaya waited for her term to end, then left to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she&rsquo;d been searching for: an endless series of battles and adventures. Rather than signing on with a mercenary company, Obozaya found herself better suited to working with small groups of adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to her vanity and showboating style. As Obozaya&rsquo;s fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and she believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard.</p>\n<p>While Obozaya appreciates wealth, her true desire is for recognition. This is best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows who&rsquo;s coming for them. Although brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya is a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she&rsquo;s not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word. In conversations with new people, she&rsquo;s direct to the point of rudeness, and she thinks most species talk too much as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong> Obozaya can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Obozaya gains a +4 bonus to her AC against&nbsp;attacks of opportunity she provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong> Obozaya&rsquo;s unarmed attacks deal lethal damage and aren&rsquo;t considered archaic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Light Reaction Cannon</strong> This two-handed ranged weapon can be fired six times before it must be reloaded. When damaging objects, it ignores 1 point of hardness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tactical Doshko</strong> This two-handed weapon can be used to make only a single attack each round due to its unwieldy special quality.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Troop Ceremonial Plate</strong> While wearing this armor, Obozaya can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 24 hours.</p>",

          "short": "",
          "value": "<p>Heavily muscled and covered with thick scales and short, sharp horns, the reptilian vesk are exactly as predatory and warlike as they appear. Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds&mdash;for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they&rsquo;ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate &ldquo;softer&rdquo; races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails&mdash;while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony &ldquo;beards&rdquo; that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that&rsquo;s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk&rsquo;s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who&rsquo;ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn&rsquo;t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding&mdash;especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk&rsquo;s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict&mdash;often called the Silent War&mdash;might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids&rsquo; dispassionate consistency, kasathas&rsquo; sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture&rsquo;s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-8 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>200-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>16 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>Armor Savant</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology. When wearing armor, they gain a +1 racial bonus to AC. When they&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor, their armor check penalty is 1 less severe than normal.</p>\n<h2>Fearless</h2>\n<p>Vesk receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Vesk can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p>Vesk can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1&ndash;1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate racial traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>Brawny</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Cave Senses</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Vesk who grew up underground in twisted caverns have more sensitive hearing. They have low-light vision and gain blindsight (sound) 60 feet, but they take a &ndash;4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet and take a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls against targets beyond 60 feet in bright light.</p>\n<p>This replaces low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Expanded Lung Capacity</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk have extraordinary lung capacity. These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this racial trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a vacuum, or would otherwise begin suffocating or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Forceful Mind</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Frilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS<em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Observant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this racial trait select either Perception or Sense Motive. They gain a +3 racial bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Prehensile Tail</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Vesk Venom</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this racial trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong>Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk&rsquo;s level + the vesk&rsquo;s Constitution modifier)<br /><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong>1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong>1/round for 6 rounds<br /><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong>Progression track is @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Healthy}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Sluggish}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Stiffened}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.<br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>1 save.

Each fighting style is composed of various style techniques that you learn as you gain experience. You must pick one fighting style upon taking your first soldier level, and once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from appear on pages 112–115.&nbsp;<em>(Or Below)</em></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wqpDgnxCVh0K1pbU]{Ambusher}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The ambusher fighting style focuses on stealth, tactical positioning, and superior reflexes to gain an edge.

This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don’t have a magic weapon in your possession.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.DAMcKQ3EGXdh8CGe]{Armor Storm}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl02_LabelName\">The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor’s capacity.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.oo4MlB56sziHi0lB]{Battlemaster}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl03_LabelName\">The battlemaster fighting style focuses on adapting your natural advantages to new dangers and situations as they arise. By anticipating particular threats or adjusting mid-combat to deal with specific foes, you can assure your survival and gain the advantage. The following soldier fighting style is an adaptation of this technique that has made its way to the Pact Worlds. You must have the armor savant and natural weapons racial traits to take this fighting style.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AKI0TQ3pSwmU5twg]{Blitz}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl04_LabelName\">The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.<br></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YHaMYdptLi3fXfVH]{Bombard}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl05_LabelName\">The bombard fighting style emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.qjAwXnudUtBHdZCe]{Fourfold Tactician}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl06_LabelName\">A fourfold tactician is a master of making use of multiple weapons and still having a spare hand. You must have four or more arms to select or use this fighting style.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.oHKHSbFfmBgFfvW8]{Guard}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl08_LabelName\">The guard fighting style focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Jba9qeZX5QgjZvwQ]{Hit-and-Run}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl09_LabelName\">The hit-and-run fighting style focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GvubHqBOlV1CsWvz]{Hunter}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl10_LabelName\">You’re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks. You may use this expertise as a sniper, trophy hunter, sport enthusiast, or fugitive tracer. Far more focused on skills than other soldiers, your unique talents combine experience in the field with refined combat ability.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2C2NBundSvw79yKG]{Qi Adept}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl12_LabelName\">You are able to tap into your personal life force, enabling you to unleash incredible strikes upon your foes. Whether you’ve discovered these techniques on your own or studied at ancient monasteries and temples devoted to these lost arts, yours is a power cultivated through intense training and skill.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.PSAr1JTGPZQ9g1j8]{Sharpshoot}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl13_LabelName\">The sharpshoot fighting style enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.f34cpBT3OiXKXssf]{Squad}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl16_LabelName\">Soldiers in large organizations, such as the Stewards, learn to fight effectively together in small squads. You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.HiI3JMXX6crpsWDN]{Wrathful Warrior}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl17_LabelName\">The wrathful warrior style draws upon your emotions—specifically your rage and wrath—to enable devastating attacks. You may have trained yourself to intentionally overload your fight-or-flight adrenaline response, or may just come from a long line of berserker warriors. At higher levels, you’re able to use your anger to ignore damage and strike with impudence.</span></p>",

Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.&nbsp;</span></p>",
