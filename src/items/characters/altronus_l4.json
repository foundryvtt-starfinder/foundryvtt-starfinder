        "value": "<p>Altronus Barasul Dovenayan was born into House Holdare, a traditional and respected family on the kasatha generation-ship-turned-homeland Idari, and he trained to be an adata&mdash;one of the scholar-priests who oversee the removal and preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasathas. Yet while Altronus was an excellent scholar, he had trouble focusing on a single topic for long. Inevitably, some interesting fact in his studies would pique his interest and draw his research off into unrelated sidetracks. This broad, self-directed education made him adept at making connections between disparate fields, yet earned him little love from traditionalist teachers.</p>\n<p>One of Altronus&rsquo;s more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, the guiding philosophy of the solarians. Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery and taught to draw strength and focus from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and soon was among the most advanced students. Yet Altronus was still slated for a career as an adata, and relished being allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship&rsquo;s famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms of stasis pods where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasathan brains could be experienced.</p>\n<p>During one of his shifts, Altronus was assigned to an inactive Sensorium access node. Though most such shifts were uneventful, on that night Altronus was surprised by the appearance of a senior adata, Remura Esolla Kaiban of Clan Senthen, flashing a warrant to allow unscheduled access to the memory of a recently deceased citizen. Thanks to his tendency to collect trivia, Altronus knew Kaiban was scheduled to be giving a lecture at the far end of the Idari. What, he wondered, could be so important that the revered adata would end the lecture early?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Altronus knew he should mind his own business, but instead contacted a friend at the far end of the ship, who informed him that not only had Adata Kaiban not left the lecture early&mdash;she was still on the stage.</p>\n<p>Immediately Altronus sounded an intruder alert, and rushed to confront the false adata. To his surprise, Altronus discovered not a kasatha, but a small, sickly, gray humanoid with long wires latched onto the Sensorium feed. Altronus leapt to activate the Sensorium emergency disconnect, but the creature attacked. Through the resulting haze of pain, Altronus managed to seal the access node&rsquo;s security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside.</p>\n<p>Unarmed, Altronus had little chance of holding the intruder at bay and no way to heal his wounds. For the first time in his life, Altronus confronted the fact that he was going to die. Like the stars themselves, he too would be extinguished, his body breaking down and being reincorporated over millennia into new worlds and stars. At last, he truly understood the&nbsp; Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it. And the universe answered.</p>\n<p>Altronus was as surprised as the strange alien to find a long, shining golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm. Yet he had seen enough solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy, and leapt to place himself between the creature and the node&rsquo;s access panels. The two fought in grim silence. Outmatched, Altronus knew he didn&rsquo;t need to win&mdash;only to buy time, keeping the creature from finishing its infiltration until help arrived.</p>\n<p>At last, ship security arrived, dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien toggled a device on its arm&mdash;and detonated its own head like a bomb.</p>\n<p>The security team questioned Altronus. When several true adata arrived, they immediately attempted to pull meaning from the alien brain-splatter, recovering two ideas: that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds, and that something important called &ldquo;Phase Three&rdquo; was approaching.</p>\n<p>The Doyenate of the Idari was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes. While the matter was officially left open to investigation, official attention quickly turned elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But Altronus couldn&rsquo;t let the issue lie. As it came time for Altronus to begin his Tempering, he realized he could never accept a role as an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him. He left the Idari, vowing to chase down every strange occurrence until he unraveled the alien conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now an adult, Altronus has remained on his Tempering for much longer than the traditional year. He often signs on with adventuring companies as a guard, researcher, or scout in order to support himself, yet his primary goal always remains researching the shadowy web of plots he first glimpsed that night in the access node. Ironically, while he comes across to many kasathas as impetuous and offbeat, his natural kasathan love of traditions, devotion to the Cycle, and scholar&rsquo;s desire to monologue about his research often causes members of other races to see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist. Any skepticism as to his usefulness, however, disappears in the first firefight, as Altronus launches himself into the fray and &ldquo;lets the cosmos take control,&rdquo; slicing through hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Black Hole (Su)</strong> When fully attuned to graviton mode, as a standard action Altronus can pull any number of creatures he targets that are within 20 feet of him toward him. Each target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or move 5 feet closer. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. After using this power, he becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blind-Fight</strong> When Altronus misses a melee attack because of concealment, he can reroll his miss chance once to see if he actually hit. He is not flat-footed against melee attacks from creatures he cannot see, can withdraw from creatures he cannot see, and doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt an Acrobatics check to move at full speed while blinded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong> As a move action, Altronus can gain DR 1/&mdash; for 1 round. When Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, he can instead gain DR 2/&mdash;, and the DR lasts as long as he remains graviton-attuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision</strong> Altronus can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Desert Stride</strong> Altronus can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at his normal rate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Four-Armed</strong> Altronus has four arms, all of which can wield and carry items normally, though this does not affect how many attacks he can make each round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Plasma Sheath</strong> As a move action, Altronus can cause all his solar weapon damage to become fire damage (though attacks still target KAC) for 1 round. If he is attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, he also increases the damage dealt by 2, and the effect lasts as long as he maintains stellar attunement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sidereal Influence</strong> Outside of combat, Altronus can tap into stellar influences to assist in him various tasks. He must meditate for 1 minute and then chooses either Diplomacy or Stealth. He adds a +1d6 insight bonus to checks with the selected skill until he enters combat, falls unconscious, sleeps, or meditates to choose another skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Solar Manifestation (Solar Weapon) </strong>Altronus has a mote of yellow light that orbits him. He can grab this and turn it into a solar weapon with the same ease as drawing a weapon. It is considered a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals 1d6 slashing damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Stellar Mode</strong> At the beginning of Altronus&rsquo;s first round in a combat, he must choose one of three modes, graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. If graviton- or photon-attuned, he gains 1 attunement point for the appropriate mode. Each round, he either maintains that mode (gaining another point of attunement, to a maximum of 3), or becomes unattuned (losing all attunement points, and he can then enter a new mode on the following turn). If Altronus has 1 or 2 points in a mode, he is attuned to that mode. If he has 3 points in a mode, he is fully attuned to that mode. Some of his abilities function only when he is attuned or fully attuned to the graviton or photon mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When attuned in graviton mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to his Reflex saves.</li>\n<li>When attuned in photon mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Supernova (Su) </strong>When Altronus is fully attuned to photon mode, as a standard action he can deal 5d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex DC 13 half). After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Beacon </strong>This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 50-foot radius. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Defrex Hide</strong> While wearing this armor, Altronus can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days. Its infrared sensors give Altronus darkvision.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashlight </strong>This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 20-foot cone. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Least Graviton Crystal</strong> This solarian weapon crystal is part of Altronus&rsquo;s solar manifestation. It adds 1d3 damage and the knockdown critical effect to his solar weapon (these benefits are already added in to his solar weapon attack above).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch</strong> Altronus can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol</strong> This small arms weapon fires physical bullets and can be fired nine times before it must be reloaded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Titanium Alloy Cable</strong> This 100-foot-long cable is designed for climbing or securing loose cargo.</p>",

You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.L3DwUSzcydcwNmAV]{Skill Adept - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"> As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose two additional skills and add them to your list of class skills. </span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7ilyZdE0yZi2F3SQ]{Solar Manifestation (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br><br>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br><br>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.<br><br><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)<br><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.XEZ8TnivxFRh1ooE]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. If you selected solar weapon as your solar manifestation, it gains the benefit of Weapon Specialization as if it were an advanced melee weapon.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.N0vqDchAa7oI0mYl]{Flashing Strikes (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UVNOjH2ERlQjcGnU]{Zenith Revelation - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br><br>Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a –5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br><br>In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>",

          "value": "<p>Originally from a planet orbiting a dying star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed kasathas maintain a reputation as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha&rsquo;s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race&mdash;the plane-hopping witchwyrds&mdash;returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew&rsquo;s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world&rsquo;s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one&rsquo;s mouth around all but one&rsquo;s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad &ldquo;great families,&rdquo; clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don&rsquo;t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified.

You might be an instructor of a specific topic at a large university or a dabbler in a number of fields of study. You could be exploring the galaxy in search of ancient artifacts or new scientific phenomena. Whatever your motivation, you are sure that the answers you seek are out there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)</h2>\n<p>You are an expert in one particular field of study, and your passion for the subject shows. Choose either Life Science or Physical Science and then choose a field of specialization. If you pick Life Science, you can specialize in bioengineering, biology, botany, ecology, genetics, xenobiology, zoology, or another field of biological science. If you pick Physical Science, you can specialize in astronomy, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, meteorology, oceanography, physics, or another field of physical science. The DC of skill checks to recall knowledge about your specialty is reduced by 5. Your chosen skill is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen skill. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>TIP OF THE TONGUE (6TH)</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, after pausing to collect your thoughts, you realize that you know the answer to a particularly challenging question. Once per day, you can reroll any skill check (see page&nbsp;243) to recall knowledge. You must decide to use this ability after rolling but before learning the information from your first roll. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>RESEARCH MAVEN (12TH)</h2>\n<p>You can research much faster than most other people, allowing you to collate information from databases, libraries, and other sources in one-quarter the normal time; with this ability, you can typically take 20 to recall knowledge in 5 rounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MASTER SCHOLAR (18TH)</h2>\n<p>To you, learning and absorbing knowledge related to your field of expertise is as refreshing as drinking from a cool spring in the middle of a desert planet. Up to twice per day, when in a situation where information from your specialty field could be useful (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), you can spend 10 minutes in deep contemplation and research of your specialty field and recover 1 Resolve Point, in addition to using recall knowledge (see page 133) for the information you seek; this doesn&rsquo;t count as resting to regain Stamina Points.</p>",

The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br><br>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br><br>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br><br>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br><br>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you. </span></p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\">Graviton Mode</h2>\n        <p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\">Photon Mode</h2>\n        <p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned.

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed. <br /><br />Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Manifestations</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.zM7oc1qiNLAPoH1J]{Solar Armor}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.kCvI3xvm0Q1slajx]{Solar Flare}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ylRInRfOfx6nsbUv]{Solar Shield}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.WWHUAfgpvk6uIgY0]{Solar Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.0GKYyi6lUKAdcPk7]{Lunar Weapon}</p>",

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level. <br><br>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon’s damage. <br><br>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</span></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n        <table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 86px;\">\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\"><strong>Solar Weapon</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">1d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">2d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">3d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">4d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">5d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">6d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">7d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">8d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">9d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">10d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">11d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n        <td style=\"width: 51px;\">12d6</td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>",

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</span></p>\n<p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"

The solarian can place the crystal inside his mote as a standard action. While within a mote, a crystal applies its effects any time that mote is in a solar weapon form. A crystal within a mote can&rsquo;t be interacted with in any way other than via abilities that specifically target a mote. The solarian can remove the crystal from his mote as a standard action, and the crystal falls loose if the mote is deactivated in any way. A solarian can&rsquo;t have more than one crystal in his mote at a given time.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal doesn&rsquo;t give a solarian the option to create a solar weapon if he did not choose that option for his solar manifestation. Most weapon crystals increase the amount of damage attacks with the solar weapon deal. This increased damage is normally the same type of damage the solarian weapon deals (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). If a solarian crystal&rsquo;s damage entry lists an abbreviation after the damage, however, the additional damage the solar weapon deals is of the indicated type.</p>\n<p>Even if a solarian weapon crystal&rsquo;s extra damage is a type of energy damage, attacks with the solar weapon still target KAC, not EAC. If a solarian crystal lists a critical effect, that critical effect applies to any critical hit the solar weapon makes while the solarian crystal is within the solarian&rsquo;s mote. For example, a solarian with a minor photon crystal and a base solar weapon damage of 2d6 deals 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, plus 1d6 fire damage, on a hit with his solar weapon.</p>\n<p>A solarian weapon crystal is a hybrid item that blends magic and technology. When a weapon crystal is within a mote and the solarian uses the mote in solar weapon form, the solar weapon is considered magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Broken Solarian Crystals</strong>: If a solarian weapon crystal with the broken condition is inside a solarian&rsquo;s solar mote, the solarian takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack and damage rolls with the solar weapon, and the solar weapon can&rsquo;t deal extra critical effects. Both effects last until the crystal is repaired. As hybrid items, solarian crystals can be repaired using the make whole or mending spells, or with the Engineering or Mysticism skills, as described in the Skills chapter.</li>\n</ul>",

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn&rsquo;t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you&rsquo;re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon&rsquo;s damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>",
