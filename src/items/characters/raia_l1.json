          "value": "<p>Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, lashuntas are at once consummate scholars and enlightened warriors, naturally divided into two specialized subraces with different abilities and societal roles.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>To survive on the predator-rich world of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, the telepathic humanoids called lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow children to develop into one of two subspecies, depending on the stresses they endure at puberty: either the tall, intellectual, and adaptable damaya&mdash;who make up most of their race&rsquo;s political leaders and ambassadors&mdash;or the short, burly, headstrong korasha, who excel as warriors and explorers. Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and humans respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Int, -2 Con<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy—which is gained from scientific study and experimentation—manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Sl47PwjLhPkni75T]{Spells (Technomancer)}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You cast spells drawn from the technomancer spell list (see page 338). To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–10: Technomancer. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–11: Technomancer Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–12: Technomancer Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem.

Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. While you don’t need your spell cache to cast your spells, once per day, you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know and are capable of casting, even if you’ve expended all your spell slots for that spell’s level.<br><br>If your spell cache is damaged, it is restored to full Hit Points the next time you prepare spells. If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.sobLlAGQkmWcFBFx]{Magic Hack - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You have carefully studied the forces that define magic and can manipulate them. You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional magic hack every 3 levels thereafter. When casting a spell, you can apply no more than one magic hack that affects the attributes of a spell (such as distant spell or extended spell). If a magic hack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier. The list of magic hacks appears starting on page 120.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.X45ZYqyHHZNakUuY]{Spell Focus - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Spell Focus as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EVMp2EOpASIpIbFQ]{Techlore (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You rewire your mind to give you greater insight into the nature of magic and technology.

As part of regaining your spells each day, you can cast a single spell into your spell cache and have it affect you continuously for 24 hours. The cache capacitor can hold any of the following spells: <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>keen senses</em>, or <em>unseen servant</em>. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. When you cast the spell into your cache capacitor, you expend the spell slot normally and make any decisions required for that spell, but the duration doesn’t expire for 24 hours. If the spell in your cache capacitor is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it, keeping the same decisions you made when you cast it, and gaining whatever duration the spell had remaining. You can’t exchange the stored spell for another spell until you again regains your spells.<br><br>At 12th level, your cache capacitor gains a second slot that can hold <em>darkvision</em>, <em>lesser resistant armor</em>, <em>life bubble</em>, or <em>spider climb</em>.<br><br>At 18th level, your cache capacitor gains a third slot that can hold <em>arcane sight</em>, <em>flight</em> (spell level 3rd or lower), <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>tongues</em>.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ja89jy7LlkSG4Zzu]{Resolve Attunement (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You recover Resolve Points when you use powerful magic.

Add up the levels of the expended slots to determine which higher level of spell you can cast (maximum 6th). For instance, you could exchange three 1st-level slots to cast a 3rd-level spell, or you could exchange two 3rd-level slots to cast a 6th-level spell. If you combine spell slots to cast a 6th-level spell, it doesn’t count as such for resolve attunement.<br><br>Furthermore, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to combine two 6th-level spell slots to cast <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.p5xoDQXN2ZcWuW71]{Cache Augmentation (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Pf9uh67LQ85K52AF]{Cache Hacks (Su)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Nvh2F2YOmAjRbzOz]{Hack Capacitor (Su)}</p>"

If the spell cache is lost or destroyed, you can replace it after 1 week with a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.</span></p>"

To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–10: Technomancer <em>(Below).</em>&nbsp;In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–11: Technomancer Bonus Spells <em>(Below) </em>—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new technomancer level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–12: Technomancer Spells Known <em>(Below).</em> Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any technomancer spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2>Spells Per Day</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"height: 336px;

Failure means the creature can’t move that round and must then succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone, while failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill on page 135 for details). A creature that doesn’t move on its turn doesn’t need to attempt this check and isn’t considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Unattended material objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect an object in a creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect. If the creature fails the initial saving throw, it immediately drops the item and must attempt a new save each round it attempts to pick up, hold, or use the item.
