          "value": "<p>Originally from a planet orbiting a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.4MxAK5uS0zMNWhUK]{Dying} star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed kasathas maintain a reputation as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange traditions.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha’s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.Item.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Kasathas evolved on Kasath, a massive desert planet orbiting a red giant. While they knew that, on a stellar scale, their sun was near death, tradition kept them from entertaining the idea of colonizing another world until shortly after the Gap. Then, their progenitor race—the plane-hopping witchwyrds—returned and told them of the perfect world: a place called @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<p>Determined to settle this promised land, the kasathas began construction of a great, slower-than-light colony ship. Hundreds of years later, the worldship&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;arrived in the Pact Worlds system. To the crew’s surprise, however, local technology had advanced, and the kasathan juggernaut found itself too vulnerable to risk invading @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. Instead, while many kasathas emigrated peacefully to that planet and the surrounding worlds, the majority elected to remain aboard the&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.nZHqkDndoLfqukCs]{Idari}&nbsp;in an orbit between @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora}, tending its rotating-drum farms and manufacturing bays while trading with other races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. The fact that their home world’s records extend further back into the Gap than any Pact World only encourages their veneration of history. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one’s mouth around all but one’s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.</p>\n<p>Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad “great families,” clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don’t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside races, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas are lawful neutral, as befits their focus on custom, though younger ones can often be more chaotic, idealistic, or self-centered.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Kasathas strive to maintain open trade with all races, yet they find some more amicable than others. They see @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.Item.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} as brutish and shameful in their focus on conquest by any means, and ysoki as loud and undignified. They get along well with lashuntas, who properly respect the knowledge of the past, and they are intrigued by both androids and shirrens—races they see as young enough to be led down proper paths. @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.Item.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} often confuse them; just when they’re ready to write all @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.Item.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} off as capricious, they meet one whose sense of honor almost matches their own.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to the Pact Worlds, and to this day most solarians are kasathas, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent soldiers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into mystics. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adjustments</strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Int</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong>&nbsp;4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong> 6-7 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong> 120-200 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong> 25 years</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong> 100+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are Medium humanoids with the kasatha subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.dwD6Qn49xAYzTktl]{Desert Stride}</h2>\n<p>Kasathas can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at their normal speed.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.DLNa7XnGG09k7OsT]{Four-Armed}</h2>\n<p>Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands’ worth of weapons and equipment.

          "value": "<p>The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes. You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.L3DwUSzcydcwNmAV]{Skill Adept - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose two additional skills and add them to your list of class skills.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.7ilyZdE0yZi2F3SQ]{Solar Manifestation (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.gkmkA4cyDvRsB3c5]{Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).</p>\n<p>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.</p>\n<p>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2>Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.G7p2YIGFTAU6uGjL]{Stellar Revelation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.</p>\n<p>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.gXYVzmz2P3WRP9vZ]{Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.</p>\n<p>To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Graviton Skills</strong>: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)</p>\n<p><strong>Photon Skills</strong>: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.UnESOXtPCmLvQ5VR]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. If you selected solar weapon as your solar manifestation, it gains the benefit of Weapon Specialization as if it were an advanced melee weapon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.N0vqDchAa7oI0mYl]{Flashing Strikes (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.UVNOjH2ERlQjcGnU]{Zenith Revelation - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.</p>\n<p>Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.7hoHfBi4pnuYZgYg]{Solarian's Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a –5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.WcJkQAG3YUgxYa3j]{Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.KkBSffcRhWf5j2Tb]{Broken Cycle}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.ouPhFsq04Htx5INw]{Extra Manifestation}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.CkndBsEO0IMsYZ4m]{Electrical Attunement (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.uDxAS2HYHU2p2e8y]{Stellar Sage}</p>"

You might be an instructor of a specific topic at a large university or a dabbler in a number of fields of study. You could be exploring the galaxy in search of ancient artifacts or new scientific phenomena. Whatever your motivation, you are sure that the answers you seek are out there.</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)</h2>\n<p>You are an expert in one particular field of study, and your passion for the subject shows. Choose either Life Science or Physical Science and then choose a field of specialization. If you pick Life Science, you can specialize in bioengineering, biology, botany, ecology, genetics, xenobiology, zoology, or another field of biological science. If you pick Physical Science, you can specialize in astronomy, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, meteorology, oceanography, physics, or another field of physical science. The DC of skill checks to recall knowledge about your specialty is reduced by 5. Your chosen skill is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen skill. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence at character creation.</p>\n<h2>TIP OF THE TONGUE (6TH)</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, after pausing to collect your thoughts, you realize that you know the answer to a particularly challenging question. Once per day, you can reroll any skill check (see page&nbsp;243) to recall knowledge. You must decide to use this ability after rolling but before learning the information from your first roll. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</p>\n<h2>RESEARCH MAVEN (12TH)</h2>\n<p>You can research much faster than most other people, allowing you to collate information from databases, libraries, and other sources in one-quarter the normal time; with this ability, you can typically take 20 to recall knowledge in 5 rounds.</p>\n<h2>MASTER SCHOLAR (18TH)</h2>\n<p>To you, learning and absorbing knowledge related to your field of expertise is as refreshing as drinking from a cool spring in the middle of a desert planet. Up to twice per day, when in a situation where information from your specialty field could be useful (at the GM’s discretion), you can spend 10 minutes in deep contemplation and research of your specialty field and recover 1 Resolve Point, in addition to using recall knowledge (see page 133) for the information you seek; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points.</p>"

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form.

The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).</p>\n<p>At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith Revelations, which can be used only when you’re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you’ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.</p>\n<p>At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.</p>\n<p>When you’re not in combat, you can’t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy. If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don’t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2>Graviton Mode (Negative value)</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you’re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Photon Mode (Positive value)</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you’re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Unattuned (Zero value)</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned.

You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise.

A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer.

This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level.</p>\n<p>Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon with an item level equal to your solarian level, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon’s damage.</p>\n<p>Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 114px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\"><strong>Solar Weapon</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.1094px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 56.8906px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

        "value": "<p>Altronus Barasul Dovenayan of House Holdare was born on the Idari and trained to be an adata—one of the scholar-priests who oversee the preservation of thin slices of the brains of deceased kasathas. Yet while Altronus was an excellent scholar, he had trouble focusing on a single topic for long, and his research inevitably wandered into unrelated sidetracks. One of Altronus’s more sympathetic teachers felt his wandering focus could be brought into line with training in the philosophy of the Cycle, the guiding philosophy of the solarians. Altronus was accepted as a student into a prestigious cosmonastery and taught to draw strength and focus from the endless repetition of celestial creation and destruction. He took to the training immediately, and was soon allowed to take on guard shifts at the ship’s famed Sholar Adat. There he watched over rooms where adata connected to the Sensorium, the technomagical temple archive where flashes of memories from archived kasathan brains could be experienced.</p>\n<p>During one of his shifts, Altronus attempted to confront a suspicious adata, only to discover it was actually a small gray humanoid in the process of hacking the Sensorium feed. Outmatched by the creature’s strange weaponry and quickly disarmed, Altronus nevertheless managed to seal the access node’s security force fields, trapping himself and the gray intruder inside. He confronted the prospect of his imminent death, and found that in it, he at last truly understood the Cycle. With his final moments, he reached out to the universe, embracing it. And the universe answered.</p>\n<p>Altronus was surprised to find a long golden blade suddenly sprouting from his lower right forearm, yet he had seen enough solarian training to recognize the blade of stellar energy, and leapt to attack. Still outmatched, Altronus knew he didn’t need to win—only buy time until help arrived.</p>\n<p>At last, ship security arrived, dragging the half-dead Altronus from the fight. Upon seeing that it was outnumbered, the bulbous-headed alien toggled a device on its arm—and detonated its own head like a bomb. When several true adata arrived, they attempted to pull meaning from the alien brain-splatter, recovering two ideas: that gray spies had deeply infiltrated the Pact Worlds, and that something important called “Phase Three” was approaching.</p>\n<p>The Doyenate was informed, and additional security added to Sensorium access nodes, after which official attention turned elsewhere. Yet Altronus couldn’t let the issue lie. Realizing he could never become an adata while the mystery of the gray invader hung over him, he left the Idari, vowing to chase down every strange occurrence until he unraveled the alien conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, Altronus often signs on with adventuring companies as a guard, scout, or researcher, yet his primary goal remains researching the conspiracy he first glimpsed that night in the Sensorium. Members of other races often see him as an eccentric professor or addled conspiracy theorist, yet any skepticism as to his usefulness disappears in the first firefight, as he launches himself into the fray and “lets the cosmos take control,” slicing through hordes of enemies with terrifying calm.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Black Hole (Su)</strong> When fully attuned to graviton mode, as a standard action Altronus can pull any number of creatures he targets that are within 25 feet of him toward him. Each target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or move 5 feet closer. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blind-Fight</strong> When Altronus misses a melee attack because of concealment, he can reroll his miss chance once to see if he actually hit. He is not flat-footed against melee attacks from creatures he cannot see, can withdraw from such creatures he cannot see, and doesn’t need to attempt an Acrobatics check to move at full speed while blinded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Corona (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Altronus can wreathe his body in flames for 1 round, gaining cold resistance 10, and any adjacent creature that hits him with a melee attack takes 2d6 fire damage. If Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to proton mode, the effect lasts until he loses his attunement, and any creature that starts its turn adjacent to him takes 4 fire damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong> As a move action, Altronus can gain DR 1/— for 1 round. When Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, he can instead gain DR 2/—, and the DR lasts as long as he remains graviton-attuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision</strong> Altronus can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Desert Stride</strong> Altronus can move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at his normal rate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashing Strikes (Ex)</strong> When Altronus makes a full attack entirely with melee weapons, he takes a –3 penalty to each attack roll rather than –4.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Four-Armed</strong> Altronus has four arms, all of which can wield and carry items normally, though this does not affect how many attacks he can make each round.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Gravity Surge (Su)</strong> As a full action, Altronus can perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a foe within 30 feet with a +15 attack bonus. When he is attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode and has a hand free, if he disarms a target of an item, it flies to his hand, and if he trips a target, he can pull it up to 10 feet closer to him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility</strong> Altronus gains a +4 bonus to his AC against attacks of opportunity he provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Plasma Sheath</strong> As a move action, Altronus can cause all his solar weapon damage to become fire damage (though his attacks still target KAC) for 1 round. If he is attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, he also increases the damage dealt by 2, and the effect lasts as long as he maintains stellar attunement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sidereal Influence</strong> Outside of combat, Altronus can tap into stellar influences to assist in him various tasks. He must meditate for 1 minute and then chooses either Diplomacy or Stealth. He adds a +1d6 insight bonus to checks with the selected skill until he enters combat, falls unconscious, sleeps, or meditates to choose another skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Solar Manifestation (Solar Weapon)</strong> Altronus has a mote of yellow light that orbits him. He can grab this and turn it into a solar weapon with the same ease as drawing a weapon. It is considered a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals 2d6 slashing damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spring Attack</strong> As a full action, Altronus can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack at any point during this movement without provoking attacks of opportunity from the target of his melee attack. He must move at least 10 feet before making the melee attack, and cannot make that attack against a creature that was adjacent to him at the beginning of his turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Stellar Mode</strong> At the beginning of Altronus’s first round in a combat, he must choose one of three modes—graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. If graviton- or photon-attuned, he gains 1 attunement point for the appropriate mode. Each round, he either maintains that mode (gaining another point of attunement, to a maximum of 3), or becomes unattuned (losing all attunement points, and he can then enter a new mode on the following turn). If Altronus has 1 or 2 points in a mode, he is attuned to that mode. If he has 3 points in a mode, he is fully attuned to that mode. Some of his abilities function only when Altronus is attuned or fully attuned to the graviton or photon mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When attuned in graviton mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to his Reflex saves.</li>\n<li>When attuned in photon mode, Altronus gains a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Supernova (Su)</strong> When Altronus is fully attuned to photon mode, as a standard action he can deal 9d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex DC 16 half). After using this power, Altronus becomes unattuned.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tip of the Tongue</strong> Once per day, Altronus can reroll any one skill check to recall knowledge.</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Advanced Semi-Auto Pistol</strong> This weapon fires physical bullets and can be fired 12 times before it must be reloaded.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Beacon</strong> This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 50-foot radius. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>D-Suit II</strong> While wearing this armor, Altronus can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 7 days. Its infrared sensors give Altronus darkvision. Its jump jets allow Altronus to fly up to 30 feet as part of a move action, but he must land at the end of his movement or fall. Jump jets can be used 10 times before their batteries needs to be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashlight</strong> This handheld light increases the light level by one step in a 20-foot cone. It can operate for 10 hours before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch</strong> Altronus can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Minor Graviton Crystal</strong> This solarian weapon crystal is part of Altronus’s solar manifestation. It adds 1d6 damage and the knockdown critical effect to his solar weapon (these benefits are already added in to his solar weapon attack above).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Synaptic Accelerators</strong> Altronus has two personal upgrades,&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a mk 1 model that gives him +2 to his Dexterity score and&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a mk 2 model that gives him +4 to his Strength score.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are already included in his statistics above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Titanium Alloy Cable</strong> This 100-foot-long cable is designed for climbing or securing loose cargo.</p>",
