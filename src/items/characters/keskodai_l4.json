          "value": "<p>Once part of a ravenous hive of locust-like predators, the insectile shirrens only recently broke with their hive mind to become a race of telepaths physically addicted to their own individualism, yet dedicated to the idea of community and harmony with other races.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Shirrens were once part of the Swarm, a monstrous race traveling from world to world, consuming all they encountered before moving on. Generations ago, however, a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break from the hive mind, with each of its members gaining a sense of self. Addicted to the new drug of individualism, these renegades rejected the Swarm&rsquo;s mindless consumption, forming a new race called shirrens that eventually came to settle within the Pact World system.</p>\n<p>Shirrens are arthropods with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae. Unlike many arthropodan races, they walk upright, manipulating items with three-clawed hands. In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their thoraxes. While often displayed, these &ldquo;mating arms&rdquo; are extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive purposes&mdash;to use them for mundane activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.</p>\n<p>Shirrens have three sexes: male, female, and host. During reproduction, female and male shirrens provide the initial eggs and sperm, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while also adding their own genetic material and immunities. In some shirren societies, a single host queen incubates for many partners and is considered the true parent, while in others, three-party marriages are common. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a tiny, wormlike larval form, and they are often carried around in protective containers to let them safely observe the world.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Not even shirrens know where the Swarm first evolved, for its vast biological colony-fleet has traveled the stars for ages and feels no need to keep track of such things. After splitting from the Swarm, the newly self-aware shirrens scattered to a number of nearby systems. A large contingent found its way to the Pact Worlds, making first contact with Vercite aethership crews and setting up a colony in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.f24qKgU5Wh5LLJyh]{Verces}&rsquo;s parched Fullbright region. Since then, shirrens have spread throughout the Pact Worlds.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Shirrens define themselves by their individualism. When they left the Swarm, they assumed partial control over the neurological pleasure and pain systems by which they were formerly directed, and even generations later, making choices for themselves can literally flood them with pleasurable neurotransmitters. While this ability is not always beneficial&mdash;some shirrens deliberately drug themselves this way, becoming &ldquo;option junkies&rdquo; blissed out on sequences of trivial decisions&mdash;freedom of choice is crucial to shirren identity. This is especially true with regard to religion, for what choice is more important than how to spend the afterlife?</p>\n<p>At the same time, having evolved from hive creatures, shirrens remain highly communal by @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} standards. Even when working with other races, they seek to foster community and teamwork and do what&rsquo;s best for the group. They are often lawful good, though loyalty and a utilitarian emphasis on &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; can also lead them down questionable paths.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Most of the common races find shirrens agreeable and useful allies, though their telepathic communication and chittering mouthparts can be disconcerting. Shirrens, for their part, are positively inclined toward all the major races, especially ysoki for their communal tendencies and zest for life. Though lashuntas often maintain their prejudice against insectile races, most shirrens don&rsquo;t hold this against them, as they themselves fear nothing more than the Swarm that spawned them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Less inclined toward violence than many races, shirrens often sign on with starship crews as ambassadors, medics, technicians, and other such noncombat roles, especially as mystics acting as ship chaplains. They adore working as part of a team and are often voices of reason in chaotic situations. This general friendliness should not be mistaken for weakness, however, as shirrens fighting for the lives of their comrades can be terrifyingly lethal, fearlessly undertaking suicidal missions for the good of the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-6 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>100-150 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>5 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>50+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are Medium humanoids with the shirren subtype.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Shirrens&rsquo; sensitive antennae grant them blindsense (vibration)&mdash;the ability to sense vibrations in the air&mdash;with a range of 30 feet. See page 262 for more information about blindsense.</p>\n<h2>Communalism</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are used to working with others as part of a team. Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<h2>Cultural Fascination</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are eager to learn about new cultures and societies. Shirrens receive a +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks.</p>\n<h2>Limited Telepathy</h2>\n<p>Shirrens can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 24</em><br />Specific groups and individual shirrens can possess a range of physiological and psychological predispositions.</p>\n<h2>Cultural Assimilation</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 24</em><br />Many shirrens learn new ideas voraciously, making them skilled at blending into other cultures. Shirrens with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to Culture and Disguise checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces cultural fascination.</p>\n<h2>Hive Defense</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 24</em><br />Shirrens deeply value friends and constantly look out for these companions. Once per day, when an ally within 10 feet of a shirren with this trait attempts a saving throw, as a reaction, the shirren can allow that ally to roll their saving throw twice and use the higher result.</p>\n<p>This replaces communalism.</p>\n<h2>Individual Obsession</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 24</em><br />Shirrens delight in individuality and experience a rush whenever they exercise their free will. This has led to many shirrens developing an obsession that stems from their personal tastes and choices. Shirrens with this trait choose one skill at 1st level. The chosen skill becomes a class skill for them, and they gain a +2 racial bonus to checks with that skill. If the chosen skill is already a class skill at 1st level, they instead gain 1 additional skill rank at each level that must be invested into the chosen skill. Shirrens who gain the chosen skill as a class skill after 1st level don&rsquo;t gain these additional skill ranks.</p>\n<p>This replaces communalism and cultural fascination.</p>\n<h2>Linguistic Acculturation</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 24</em><br />Shirrens quickly adapt to new languages they encounter, because doing so enables them to communicate their thoughts with new people and learn from them in turn. Shirrens with this trait gain a +2 bonus to Culture checks and learn two languages for each skill rank they have in the Culture skill.</p>\n<p>This replaces cultural fascination.</p>"

You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4–4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4–5: Mystic Bonus Spells—note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4–6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action.

The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br><br>Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.emGD6wT4o7VbHx0O]{Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dXYaeTjwjT4Yr4Rk]{Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with your connection’s associated skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AFyfOC7qaEpto7f3]{Mindlink (Sp) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it.

You can cast each of your connection spells once per day without consuming a spell slot. In addition, you learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br><br>You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.RmwJt3BRTlTW0D06]{Enlightenment (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp; You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast <em>miracle</em> as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dE8h1C8gOUyzeS0J]{Epiphanies}</p>"

You can spend 1 Resolve Point to channel this energy. Healing yourself with channeled energy is a move action, healing an ally you touch is a standard action, and healing all allies within 30 feet is a full action. This energy restores 2d8 Hit Points and increases by 2d8 at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.uLEtB8Fydzv49akN]{Lifelink (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>At the start of each turn, you can choose an ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage and transfer her wounds to yourself, dealing an amount of damage up to your mystic level to your Hit Points (bypassing any Stamina Points you may have) and healing the ally’s Hit Points an equal amount. This doesn’t require any action on your part. You can’t prevent or reduce the damage you take from lifelink.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.271GG40G7qRDKO8M]{Healer’s Bond (Sp) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can form a bond with up to three allies, allowing you to constantly sense their condition as per the <em>status</em> spell. This bond lasts until dispelled or until you create a new healer’s bond, which immediately ends the previous one. At 11th level, when you gain the telepathic bond class feature, you also gain the effects of <em>status</em> on all creatures linked by your telepathic bond.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.hpoMkCR8INB72QbM]{Steal Life (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to steal part of a creature’s life force and transfer it to yourself or others. You must touch the target (requiring a successful melee attack against its EAC), which deals 1d6 damage for every 2 mystic levels you have (maximum 10d6). Choose an ally within 30 feet; that ally recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt (to a maximum of the foe’s remaining Hit Points). Alternatively, you can heal yourself instead, but you restore only a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If this heals the recipient (you or your ally) up to maximum Hit Points, any excess persists for 1 hour as temporary Hit Points. If your attack misses, you don’t lose the Resolve Point.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JNs24T1CsisQvaEK]{Channel Bond (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you use healing channel as a standard action, you can heal an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature as if you were touching that ally, as long as the ally is within 120 feet. When you use healing channel as a full action, it heals all allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature within 120 feet (as well as all other allies within 30 feet).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JgygiXsLGb6tlkFq]{Channel Life (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you use healing channel on a creature that has died within 1 round, you can bring it back to life as per a 5th-level <em>mystic cure</em> spell.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NSXREp19pTNTmWTs]{Deny Death (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to death effects and negative levels. If you would normally die from damage, as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can immediately spend all of your remaining Resolve Points to instead stay alive. If your Hit Points would have been reduced to 0, you now have 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t regain Resolve Points again until you rest for 8 hours, even if you have another means to do so.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Keskodai grew up on Verces. The child of a priest of Hylax, Keskodai always felt a deep connection to the divine, yet chafed at the idea of serving the same god as his parent. Exactly which god he&rsquo;d serve instead remained unclear, until the coming of the Gray Shakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Believed to be the result of a biotech experiment gone wrong, the plague called the Gray Shakes burned through the city like wildfire, turning shirrens&rsquo; chitin gray, rotting off their antennae, and eating away at their telepathy and motor functions, leaving them awake but unable to communicate until they finally expired. In the weeks it took the government to find a cure, thirty percent of the city&rsquo;s shirren population died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the midst of this horror, a young Keskodai first encountered priests of Pharasma. Somberly, the Pharasmins walked among the afflicted, offering healing where they could and comfort to those too far gone, whispering to them of the Cycle of Souls and the new worlds that awaited them. The beauty of their ministry moved Keskodai, and he quickly joined their hospice work, leaving home to study at a temple in the Ring of Nations once the plague was safely contained.</p>\n<p>After years as an initiate, Keskodai returned home a full priest of Lady of Graves. He quickly fell in love with and married two members of his congregation, a female-host couple. Yet part of him remained unsatisfied. He began to wonder if he&rsquo;d made the right choice in coming home. How could he know if he wanted this when there was still so much out there that he&rsquo;d never experienced? The desire to explore continued to grow, until at last, after the birth of their first son, he and his partners agreed that Keskodai would leave and see the galaxy, taking their child with him to expose him to the same new experiences. Once the child was old enough to leave his cradle-jar, Keskodai would decide whether he&rsquo;d seen enough to return in good conscience, in which case both of them be welcomed with open arms. If not, the child would return alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his effort to see as many worlds as possible, Keskodai signs on with freelance adventurers. While capable in combat, he prefers to act as the ship&rsquo;s medic, patching up broken allies or blessing them on their journey into the Great Beyond. The cheerful manner in which he talks about death often disturbs those under his care, yet anyone who spends much time with the shirren quickly learns that his even-keeled, fatalistic approach to life and death makes him an excellent healer.</p>\n<p>As with many shirren, Keskodai is a team player and a social butterfly who loves meeting new people. A crewmate once called him &ldquo;the galaxy&rsquo;s friendliest death priest,&rdquo; and he wears the badge with pride. Though fond of option bars and other artificial means of stimulating his choice centers, he&rsquo;s careful not to let himself overindulge&hellip; usually. He&rsquo;s intensely proud of the aesthetics of his gear, his collection of trophies, and his mustache (which he thinks lends him an air of gravitas). His greatest pride, however, is his son Chk Chk, still in his larval stage. Like many shirren parents, Keskodai carries Chk Chk around in a heavily fortified cradle-jar designed to let the child learn about the world from relative safety. While Chk Chk isn&rsquo;t old enough to truly speak, Keskodai holds conversations with him regularly, with Chk Chk tapping on the glass to answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Blindsense</strong> Keskodai ignores all forms of visual camouflage and invisibility when attempting Perception checks to notice creatures within 30 feet, though creatures he can&rsquo;t see still gain full concealment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Communalism </strong>Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, Keskodai can roll a single attack roll or skill check twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Harm Undead</strong> When Keskodai uses healing channel as a full action, he can expend 1 Resolve Point to also deal damage to all undead within 30 feet. The damage is equal to the amount the healing channel heals, though undead can attempt a Will save (DC 16) for half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Healing Channel (Su) </strong>Keskodai can spend 1 RP to restore 4d8 HP to himself (as a move action), an ally touched (as a standard action), or all allies within 30 feet (as a full action).Healing Touch (Su) Once per day, Keskodai can spend 10 minutes to restore 20 Hit Points to an ally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lifelink (Su)</strong> At the start of Keskodai&rsquo;s turn, he can select one ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage. Keskodai restores up to 4 Hit Points to that ally (not to exceed the ally&rsquo;s maximum HP), and takes the same amount of damage to his Hit Points (bypassing his SP). Damage taken from lifelink can&rsquo;t be reduced through any means. This does not take an action.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Keskodai can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mindlink (Sp)</strong> Keskodai can touch a creature to telepathically transmit as much information as could normally be communicated in 10 minutes. Keskodai can use this on a specific creature only once every 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>Keskodai can cast the following spells, each as a standard action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Command</em>: Keskodai can give a verbal command (which must be approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt) and target one living creature within 35 feet. For 1 round, the target obeys that command (Will DC 16 negates). This is a compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Affliction</em>: Keskodai can determine whether a creature or object is cursed, diseased, or poisoned, and can determine the exact affliction with a successful Life Science, Medicine, or Wisdom check.</li>\n<li><em>Detect Magic</em>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magicalsource is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em>Disguise Self</em>: Keskodai can change his appearance to that of a different humanoid creature for 40 minutes. He gains a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. Creatures that interact with him in this form can attempt a DC 16 Will save to realize his appearance is illusory.</li>\n<li><em>Fatigue</em>*: Keskodai makes a melee attack with his base attack bonus plus his Wisdom modifier (total +7) against a target&rsquo;s EAC. If the attack hits, the target is fatigued for 4 rounds (Fort DC 15 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Fog Cloud</em>: This spell creates a 20-ft.-radius-spread cloud of fog that grants concealment (a 20% miss chance for attackers) or total concealment (50% miss chance) for creatures more than 5 feet from the attacker.</li>\n<li><em>Lesser Remove Condition</em>*: This spell removes one of the following conditions from a touched target: shaken, sickened, or staggered. This does not remove a disease or other ongoing effect that could cause the target to regain the condition.</li>\n<li><em>Mind Thrust (1st-Level Spell):</em> This spell deals 2d10 damage (Will DC 16 half) to one creature within 35 feet that has an Intelligence score.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mind Thrust (2nd-Level Spell):</em> This spell deals 4d10 damage (Will DC 17 half) to one creature within 35 feet that has an Intelligence score.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Mystic Cure* (1st-Level Spell):</em> With a touch, Keskodai can restore 1d8+4 Hit Points to one living creature.</li>\n<li><em>Mystic Cure* (2nd-Level Spell):</em> With a touch, Keskodai can restore 3d8+4 Hit Points to one living creature.</li>\n<li><em>Psychokinetic Hand:</em> Once this spell is cast, as long as Keskodai concentrates (a standard action each round), he can take a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weigh 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. He can&rsquo;t preform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but could push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n<li><em>Reflecting Armor: </em>Once cast, this spell lasts for 40 minutes or until dismissed. When Keskodai takes Hit Point damage from an attack made by a weapon within 100 feet, he can dismiss this spell as a reaction, causing the attacker to take the same amount of damage (to a maximum of 10 damage, Reflex DC 16 half).</li>\n<li><em>Share Language</em>: Keskodai can grant a creature touched to read, understand, and speak (if able) up to three languages Keskodai knows.</li>\n<li><em>Stabilize</em>: This spell causes a dying creature that has 0 Hit Points to stabilize.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Telekinetic Projectile</em>: Keskodai can telekinetically hurl an object weighing up to 5 pounds at a target within 30 feet, making an attack roll (+4 bonus) against its KAC. If he hits, both the target and the object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sub>* Casting this spell does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</sub></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic Medkit</strong> Keskodai can use this kit to attempt a DC 25 Medicine check to treat deadly wounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Battle Staff</strong> If Keskodai hits a foe with this two-handed weapon, he gains a +1 bonus to his AC against melee attacks from that foe for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Defrex Hide</strong> While wearing this armor, Keskodai can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Ring of Resistance</strong> This magic ring grants a +1 resistance bonus to Keskodai&rsquo;s lowest saving throw (this bonus has already been applied to his Fortitude save).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This pistol fires bolts of damaging sonic energy. It can be fired 10 times before its battery must be recharged or replaced.</p>",
