You might be a trickster, hustler, or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or businessperson, paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick. You are often the group’s strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in diplomacy, serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems or gaining audiences with local politicians or warlords.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hIhgdXnqGHBm0A64]{Envoy Improvisation - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn envoy improvisations—little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck. You learn your first envoy improvisation at 1st level, and you learn an additional improvisation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. The list of envoy improvisations appears on page 62.</p>\n<p>If an improvisation allows you to grant an effect to an ally, you cannot grant yourself that effect unless the improvisation states otherwise. If an envoy improvisation allows a saving throw to resist its effects or requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + half your envoy level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Some envoy improvisations are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Language-dependent}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Mind-affecting}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent}, or some combination of any or all of these. These terms are defined on page 270.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.OzwMoyrdE3fcNZLP]{Expertise (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are an expert at dealing with challenges that test your skills, be the challenges social or otherwise. At 1st level, when attempting a Sense Motive check, you can roll 1d6 (your expertise die) and add the result of the roll to your check as an insight bonus. You can use this and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d8 as your expertise die instead of 1d6.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level, you have even greater expertise with skills to which you can add your expertise die that you have also selected with the Skill Focus feat. For each such skill, once per day when rolling your expertise die to add to that skill, you may roll the expertise die twice and take the better of the two results.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.0HPp0nK0L1VawPYN]{Skill Expertise (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can use expertise with one additional class skill. You must have at least 1 rank in a skill to select it, and it must come from the following list: Bluff (Cha), Computers (Int), Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Engineering (Int), Intimidate (Cha), and Medicine (Int).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DR8JvF0xiwsXggxj]{Expertise Talent - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose an expertise talent, which gives you an extra option when using a skill with which you have expertise. The list of expertise talents appears on pages 269–270.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.7KlK63jbcKN0zJLr]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Envoy) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.3PDrv9AcAX9p4gzg]{True Expertise (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain total mastery over one of your envoy improvisations and can use it with but a thought. When you gain this ability, choose one improvisation you know that has an effect when you spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can gain the improvisation’s effect without spending the Resolve Point. This ability has no benefit if the improvisation requires more than 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hBxvwY1SxmxTNRXk]{Combat Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.QaeRFGtNZ0OoKdbF]{Magical Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.a14dTDNr3SSInCHx]{Motivation Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.n4lSAvGX5mYztrU3]{Polymorphic Disguise (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.M2lelEywtGorjR0r]{Psychic Expertise}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.rScW5xGzTF62Xhdy]{Signature Item (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.2a88rr5iDbKC8jFo]{Spell Speaker (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DRG3bJiyOLEq0kff]{Tech Whisperer (Ex)}</p>"

          "value": "<p>Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond than any of their neighbor races—for better and for worse. They’ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans’ tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion’s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion’s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward—who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it’s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there’s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it’s that it’s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves—a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a “younger” race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment—though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans—if only because humans’ tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own—and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments&nbsp;</strong>+2 to any one ability score</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5-7 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100-300 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age</strong> 80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.mf2OoveG0kVdzHum]{Bonus Feat}</h2>\n<p>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.LOVB0bQtpDG4ZyRi]{Skilled}</h2>\n<p>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Species Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em></p>\n<p>The cultural, genetic, and mystical influences that some humans are subjected to can produce species traits different from the norm.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.mULbAasM9EONGWS3]{Adopted}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em></p><em></em><p><em></em> Many humans thrive in racially diverse metropolitan areas, and some individuals are adopted by members of a different species.

        "value": "<p>Born into a wealthy family on Absalom Station, the envoy who calls herself Navasi spent much of her childhood avoiding her parents in their sprawling, six-story home in the Nyori Palisades. Navasi quickly grew dissatisfied with high-society life, and began to dream of stealing the affluent’s unearned wealth and giving it to those in need. She eventually snuck away to join up with the piratical Free Captains of the Diaspora. Once there, however, poverty gave her little choice in the jobs she took, with her guild masters forcing her to steal from the fortunate and unfortunate alike. A few years in the streets showed her how much of her former life she’d taken for granted, and it taught her that if she wanted to take care of others, she first needed to take care of herself. She quickly gained a reputation in the gang as the best fast-talker and face around, spinning bold plans and quick wits into fat paydays.</p>\n<p>That all changed when she met another rebellious young woman and fell in love. Together, they sought to pull a fast one on Navasi’s bosses, sabotaging an attempt to knock over a medship full of supplies bound for Absalom Station. In the ensuing ambush, Navasi’s companion sacrificed herself to save Navasi’s life, giving the young envoy a chance to flee the Diaspora. As she made her way back to Absalom Station with the medship, knowing that neither the pirates nor her spurned family would ever stop looking for her, she forsook both of her former lives and took the name of her fallen love—Navasi— swearing that henceforth she’d carry on the fight they’d started together, stealing only from those who deserved it and putting her finger in the eye of all who thrive on exploitation.</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Expertise (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;If Navasi has at least 1 Resolve Point remaining when she attempts a Bluff or Sense Motive check, she can roll 1d6 and add it to the result as an insight bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Get ’Em (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;As a move action, Navasi selects one foe within 60 feet that she can see or hear, and that can see or hear her. Navasi and her allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls against that foe until the end of her next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Feint</strong>&nbsp;As a move action, Navasi can attempt a Bluff check against a single opponent (DC = either 10 + her opponent’s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater) to cause that opponent to be flat-footed for the next attack she makes against it before the end of her next turn.</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Azimuth Laser Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This weapon can be fired 20 times before its battery needs to be recharged or replaced.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flashlight</strong>&nbsp;Navasi’s flashlight increases the light level by one step in a 20-foot cone and can be used for 10 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk I Serum of Healing</strong>&nbsp;Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 Hit Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch&nbsp;</strong> Navasi can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat poison task.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Second Skin</strong>&nbsp;While wearing this armor, Navasi can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Smoke Grenade</strong>&nbsp;This creates smoke in a 20-foot radius that lasts 1 minute.</p>",
