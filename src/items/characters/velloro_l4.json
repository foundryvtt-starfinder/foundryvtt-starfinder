        "value": "<p>Velloro was adopted into a large ysoki family on the dusty planet of Akiton as an infant. Members of his family worshipped Iomedae, goddess of justice and honorable battle&mdash;virtues the young lashunta gladly embraced. He spent his youth playing and scavenging among Akiton&rsquo;s numerous wrecked starships with his many siblings. Time and again, Velloro proved a fierce protector of his family, putting himself between them and the many dangers of their dying world.</p>\n<p>When Velloro reached adolescence, he developed into the korasha clade of his species, packing on muscle and becoming rather headstrong. His years of junkyard scrapping pointed him toward one obvious direction in Akiton&rsquo;s limited job market: he became a gladiator in the VitariTech Coliseum, a new sporting venue that hosted nonlethal gladiatorial combats.</p>\n<p>As Velloro moved up through the ranks of other local combatants, he also became close with a fellow gladiator, a shobhad named Dhareen. She saw potential in the young competitor, and after defeating Velloro in a particularly important match, Dhareen invited the dejected lashunta to take the Test of the Mountain. In this shobhad tradition, travelers climb to the summit of Ka, the tallest mountain in the Pact Worlds. Velloro accepted the challenge.</p>\n<p>While climbing Ka, the charismatic and sociable Velloro experienced something entirely new and, at first, unpleasant: loneliness. Yet as his isolation grew, so too did his connection to the mountain. One night, while taking shelter from a violent storm, Velloro felt a strange acceptance and calm wash over him. As he did, he noticed the whirling mixture of ashy sleet around him turn to a gentle eddy. With sudden clarity, Velloro remembered dozens of instances earlier in his life when he had subtly affected the state of matter around him&mdash;events he had dismissed as coincidence or figments of his imagination. Invigorated, the lashunta began to intentionally exert control over his surroundings, structuring and deconstructing the molecular lattice all around him</p>\n<p>Upon his return to the Coliseum, Velloro exhibited new purpose, using his newfound skills to great effect in his gladiatorial matches. His tendency to crumple the armor and weapons of his opponents as he sent them flying across the arena quickly earned him the nickname the Castrovel Crusher. But as Akiton&rsquo;s gladiatorial combats continued to gain in popularity, the demand for blood sport also grew. The Coliseum&rsquo;s management began to pressure Velloro to mortally wound his opponents. Velloro adamantly refused; he saw no honor in needless blood sport.</p>\n<p>One day, just before a match against Dhareen, Velloro&rsquo;s manager told him, &ldquo;finish her&mdash;or you&rsquo;re finished.&rdquo; Velloro walked into the arena, embraced his mentor, and left the coliseum, the crowd bursting into an uproar mixed with cheers and mockery. Knowing he could never return to his beloved profession, Velloro turned an eye to the stars, where he knew there were others like his family&mdash;others who needed protection and assistance.</p>\n<p>Velloro is quick to laugh and make new friends. Despite the sour end to his gladiatorial career, his love of games and sport have not waned, and he is always happy to strike his famous Castrovel Crusher pose at a fan&rsquo;s request</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Aspect Embodiment (Ex)</strong> Once per combat, when Velloro hits multiple creatures in a single round with an attack or attacks (or effects that require an attack roll), he can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking an additional action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bodyguard </strong>As a reaction when an adjacent ally is attacked, Velloro can grant that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against that attack. If he does so, Velloro takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his own Armor Class until the beginning of his next turn.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cleave</strong> Velloro can choose to take a &ndash;2 penalty to his AC until his next turn in order to make a melee attack against a foe adjacent to him as a standard action. If he hits, he can make a second melee attack against a different foe adjacent to both him and the first foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Pool (Su)</strong> Velloro has a pool of Entropy Points (EP) that he can spend to fuel different abilities. He can have up to 3 EP in his entropic pool at a time, and he can gain EP only when involved in a combat encounter. When combat begins, Velloro gains 1 EP at the beginning of his first action; at the end of combat, he loses any Entropy Points he has remaining. He can gain EP in the following ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While he has no Entropy Points, Velloro can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>Each time he takes 8 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any effects that reduce that damage, such as mitigate), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If Velloro takes damage from a critical hit, he gains 1 EP, in addition to any he would gain from the attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</li>\n<li>If Velloro scores a critical hit on a significant enemy, he gains 1 EP.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If he takes a full action to charge, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If he takes two move actions on the same turn to move his speed each time, Velloro gains 1 EP.</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of Velloro&rsquo;s next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to him or he designates a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If Velloro&rsquo;s entropic focus takes 8 or more damage from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage), he gains 1 EP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Velloro can expend Entropy Points in the ways listed below or for his flatten bullets ability. As long as he has at least 1 EP in his entropic pool, he gains a +1 enhancement bonus to his Armor Class.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move his speed, Velloro can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type he has).</li>\n<li>As a move action, Velloro can expend 1 EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack he makes before the start of his next turn. He must decide how many EP to expend when he takes this move action, and he can&rsquo;t expend more than 3 EP. If the boosted entropic strike hits, he deals +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropic Strike (Su) </strong>This is a one-handed magical advanced melee attack with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC. Velloro does not need a free hand to make this attack. The damage dealt by this attack is acid, bludgeoning, or both. He can deliver the attack with his body or through his shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Entropy Shield (Su)</strong> As part of any move action or full action he takes, Velloro can create a field of compressed entropy that forms in place on one of his limbs to protect him as a basic riot shield or basic tactical shield (he chooses which each time he creates the shield). The shield has no bulk, but it otherwise functions as a physical shield of the selected type.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Velloro can dismiss the shield as part of any move or full action he takes, and it disappears at the end of his turn if he&rsquo;s not holding it.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Basic Riot Shield </em>Velloro gains a +1 shield bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to any bull rush combat maneuvers he attempts. He also takes a &ndash;2 penalty to skill checks affected by armor check penalties.</li>\n<li><em>Basic Tactical Shield</em><strong> </strong>As a move action, Velloro can align the shield to give himself greater protection against one opponent, granting him a +1 shield bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent until the beginning of his next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flatten Bullets (Su)</strong> When he would be hit by a ranged attack with a weapon that deals kinetic damage, Velloro can spend 1 Entropy Point as a reaction to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 the CR or level of the attacker) to take half damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lashunta Magic</strong> Velloro has the following spell-like abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Daze</em>: This spell causes a humanoid creature of CR 3 or lower within 35 feet to be dazed for 1 round (Will DC 11 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Detect Thoughts</em>: Velloro can detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures within a 60-foot cone, and if he concentrates, he can attempt to read those thoughts (Will DC 12 negates).</li>\n<li><em>Psychokinetic Hand</em>: Once cast, as long as he concentrates (a standard action each round) Velloro can use a move action to move an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less up to 15 feet. He can&rsquo;t perform fine manipulation (such as firing a weapon or using a computer), but can push a single button or close a container&rsquo;s lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Limited Telepathy (Su)</strong> Velloro can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet that share a language with him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mitigate (Su) </strong>As a reaction when he takes damage, Velloro can spend 1 EP to reduce the damage he takes by 4. If he does, he can&rsquo;t gain any EP from that attack. Additionally, as a swift action, Velloro can remove any DR or energy resistance he has, or end the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases his AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for him. If he ends an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, he suspends the listed benefits until the beginning of his next turn. Additionally, whenever Velloro is first affected by an ability or spell that grants him DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, he can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Reactive (Ex) </strong>Once per day, Velloro can take up to two reactions in a single round. He can still only take one reaction per triggering event.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rugged </strong>This alternative racial trait grants the Toughness feat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness </strong>Velloro gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Velloro adds his character level to damage dealt with melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with operative melee weapons and small arms (though he adds his full level to his entropic strike damage rolls). This is already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Lashunta Ringwear II</strong> While wearing this armor, Velloro can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 5 days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thunderstrike Sonic Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 10 times before it needs to be reloaded or recharged (each shot uses 2 battery charges). It has a range increment of 40 feet.</p>",

You might be a veteran of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}'s fighting pits, a student of the ritualized styles of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.sRunEYMfbrHeHcl7]{Triaxus}'s battleflowers, or the sort of masochist who can't help but return to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.0VTtBYDJC5vUC434]{Eox}'s Halls of the Living. You're likely to die before your habits do, though, as you find few things more exciting than the rush of battle and the pounding cheers of a thousand fans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">1ST)</span></h2>\n<p>Your experience in the arenas has exposed you to countless warrior cultures, and you both recognize strange martial arts and know how to impress others with your own unique style. Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about entertainment combat, fighting styles, and gladiatorial traditions by 5. Intimidate is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>FAMOUS FIGHTER (<span class=\"levelNum\">6TH)</span></h2>\n<p>You have developed a considerable fandom that loves you for your arena prowess. You're famous enough that others require only a DC 15 Culture check to recognize your name and a DC 25 Culture check to recognize you out of context from your appearance alone. Because you're famous for your brutal stage presence, you can spend twice the normal amount of time when using Intimidate to bully a creature whose attitude is indifferent or better. If you do and succeed at the check, when the effect wears off, the creature's attitude toward you is worsened only to indifferent, not unfriendly. At the GM's discretion, a die-hard fan's attitude might be worsened to friendly instead, or you might be able to use this ability against an unfriendly target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PART OF THE OUTFIT (12TH)</h2>\n<p>Your name is synonymous with your gladiatorial persona and outfit. As long as your gear is in good condition, you don't take any circumstantial penalties for wearing light armor or heavy armor in social situations (such as wearing golemforged plate to a formal event). You can use Intimidate or Profession (gladiator; Charisma) to \"hide\" up to two smaller weapons (such as a small arm or one-handed melee weapon with light bulk) or one larger melee weapon on your body, though you do not conceal the weapon so much as convince others to accept your carrying it without any objections. You can draw these weapons as normal; you do not need to spend a standard action as you would to draw a hidden weapon. Otherwise, this functions as the hide object task of Sleight of Hand. At the GM's discretion, areas with especially high security may not allow you to carry weapons at all, no matter your reputation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CROWD FAVORITE (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>The first time each day you deal the finishing blow (reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points) to a significant enemy in front of an audience (consisting of at least one bystander or ticket-holding fan, but not another enemy), you regain 1 Resolve Point. If the audience contains 20 or more creatures, you instead regain 2 Resolve Points.</p>",

          "value": "<p>Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, lashuntas are at once consummate scholars and enlightened warriors, naturally divided into two specialized subraces with different abilities and societal roles.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>To survive on the predator-rich world of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, the telepathic humanoids called lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow children to develop into one of two subspecies, depending on the stresses they endure at puberty: either the tall, intellectual, and adaptable damaya&mdash;who make up most of their race&rsquo;s political leaders and ambassadors&mdash;or the short, burly, headstrong korasha, who excel as warriors and explorers. Both feature short forehead antennae that focus their natural telepathy, as well as colorful swirls and raised markings on their faces unique to each individual. Due to natural pheromones and lashuntas&rsquo; almost perfect physical symmetry, most humanoid races find lashuntas of both subspecies subconsciously (and sometimes unnervingly) attractive.</p>\n<p>Both clades of the species bear the same genetics, allowing them to intermarry and have children. While all lashunta children inherit complexions and certain distinguishing features from their parents, their subspecies is not one of them. Through psychic ritual and force of will techniques applied at puberty, modern lashuntas have mastered the ability to determine what subspecies a child will grow into, activating certain epigenetics and shutting down others. While some lashunta city-states attempt to steer children in particular directions, such as via government-run aptitude tests, most lashuntas believe passionately in a child&rsquo;s right to choose. In ancient lashunta history, their starkly divided gender roles led to subspecies almost universally correlated with gender, but as lashunta culture has grown more egalitarian, gender balance between the two subspecies has become roughly equal.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas form the most prominent race on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, and have long been organized into independent city-states for protection against the planet&rsquo;s many apex predators. At the same time, thanks to their large number of magical portals, lashuntas regularly ventured to other worlds even before the advent of space travel, and they have developed particularly close bonds with societies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Though lashunta societies usually characterize themselves as meritocracies, their leaders have traditionally been women and are usually damaya except in times of war. Both damaya and korasha lashuntas see education as one of the highest callings, making lashunta scholars renowned across the solar system. Military service is also valued, since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}&rsquo;s dangerous ecosystem and lack of overarching governments mean that settlements need warriors to protect them from jungle monsters. Of these soldiers, the most iconic are the traditional shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with and take their name from their saurian mounts.</p>\n<p>On the whole, lashuntas&rsquo; focus on self-improvement, honor, and communal defense leads them toward good alignments, with damaya tending to be more lawful and korasha more chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Lashuntas believe that every culture has something to teach, and thanks to the legendary prowess of lashunta diplomats, most other races respect them and consider them allies, or at least reasonable associates. Vesk admire their warriors, androids and kasathas value their logic and learning, and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} respect their scholarship but risk embarrassing themselves trying to deal with lashuntas&rsquo; disconcerting attractiveness. Shirrens are the main exception to this pattern of mutual respect&mdash;though lashuntas&rsquo; millennia of warfare with the insectile formians has finally ended, many lashuntas are still uncomfortable interacting with similar races and worry that &ldquo;the bugs&rdquo; may one day unite against them.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>When a lashunta leaves home, it&rsquo;s often to grow&mdash;in knowledge, prowess, or simple enlightenment. Experience is the best teacher, and the thrill of discovery means that a lashunta adventurer is as likely to be drawn to a new world by a rumor of lost lore as by the promise of wealth. Of course, this quest for wisdom sounds less noble once it&rsquo;s understood that the prestige associated with bringing significant new knowledge home to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} all but assures a lashunta the finest creature comforts for the rest of his life as a corporate consultant or professor at a university. Lashunta adventurers are most frequently envoys, technomancers, and mechanics, but soldiers and operatives are also common, the latter being trained and employed by the numerous powerful lashunta-owned corporations that have surpassed many citystates as the primary political powers on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Cha, +2 Str, -2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>5-7 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>140-180 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;20 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age </strong>80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation.

These psychically resistant lashuntas emit a low-level psychic static that sometimes leads other members of their naturally telepathic society to exclude them, though such lashuntas are often more skilled in verbal expression. Some can use this static to interfere with nearby telepathy.</p>\n<p>Psychically resistant lashuntas gain a +2 racial bonus to Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. They can use mental silence once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>This replaces lashunta magic and limited telepathy.</p>\n<h2>Rugged</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 22</em><br />Some lashuntas express their species&rsquo; love of learning by focusing on physical training rather than on academic pursuits.

The entropy within the universe and the level of chaos within any system stand at your disposal, and you channel them into potent combat abilities. To you, the inevitable decay of the galaxy is simply a force to shape, control, and even temporarily reverse. The ability to control when and how things change defines your philosophy and power, allowing you to transform blows that should have destroyed you into ticking time bombs of destruction ready to be unleashed upon your enemies.<br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.1HVLxal9WXqtMiCg]{Entropic Pool (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have the supernatural ability to control matter as it changes states, allowing you to arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.6Fuz5JTbJCBPynZd]{Entropic Strike (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2–2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wq8dRJYQ58VZQuZU]{First Vanguard Aspect - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.<br><br>You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can’t be changed. Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53–55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.5bNbood0KKzBbKyv]{Mitigate (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can control how you are affected by damage or effects that alter damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can’t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.<br><br>Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Dysu4F8licjEb2FY]{Vanguard Discipline - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines. You learn your first vanguard discipline at 2nd level and an additional discipline every 2 levels thereafter. The list of vanguard disciplines appears on pages 55–57. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t select the same discipline more than once. If a vanguard discipline allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.avUIfY50kR6ZwAv5]{Reactive (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can take an additional reaction during a single round, though you can still take only one reaction per triggering event. You can take a reaction before the first time you act in a combat, but not in a surprise round in which you are unable to act.<br><br>At 9th level and again at 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day, though you can never use this ability to take more than two reactions in a round or one per triggering event.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.xrXIGoZhILVizIBD]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. You also gain a special form of weapon specialization for your entropic strike, allowing you to add a bonus to your damage equal to your vanguard class level plus half of any other class levels you have.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Qy3l9fgoVaGLV7YD]{Entropic Attunement (Su) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>As you learn to exert finer control over your entropic strike, you can enhance it to devastating effect. The saving throw DC for any of these effects that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.<br><br>At 5th level, choose one of the following weapon special properties: breachAR, bright, feintAR, forceAR, or penetrating. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike has the chosen special property.<br><br>At 7th level, choose one of the following critical hit effects: corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have), knockdown, or staggered. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. Your entropic strike gains this critical hit effect as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point. If your entropic strike has another critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can choose either the entropic attunement critical hit effect or the other critical hit effect. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.<br><br>At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property. The reach granted by this property increases by an additional 5 feet at 13th level, 16th level, and 19th level.<br><br>At 13th level, just before making an attack, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to grant your next attack the blast weapon special property with a range of 20 feet. At 16th level, this range increases to 30 feet, and at 19th level, it increases to 60 feet.<br><br>At 16th level, as a standard action you can use your entropic strike to strike the ground or clap your hands together to deal damage in a radius. Make a single melee attack roll and compare the result to the EAC of creatures and objects within 20 feet (other than yourself). You damage each creature and object with an EAC equal to or lower than the attack result. You can expend 1 EP to exclude a number of targets equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).<br><br>At 19th level, as long as you have 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike gains a second weapon special property, selected from those listed at 5th level. When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can apply either the severe wound critical hit effect or any one of the critical hit effects listed at 7th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vbrTSpb6HaJwibl8]{Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn’t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you’re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don’t provide any advantage against you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.KEzMFkStFDA5pFMQ]{Second Vanguard Aspect - 8th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your understanding of the many ways entropy can control the physical world expands.

In addition to methods granted by vanguard aspects, you can gain Entropy Points in the followings ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you have no Entropy Points, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP (2 EP at 10th level).</li>\n<li>Each time you take damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take damage from a critical hit, you gain 1 EP, in addition to any you gain from the attack’s normal damage.</li>\n<li>If you score a critical hit on a significant enemy, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take a full action to charge, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take two move actions on the same turn to move your speed each time, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>As a move action, you can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of your next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to you or you designate a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If your entropic focus takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. If you are at least 6th level, you can expend a Resolve Point to designate an adjacent, willing ally as your entropic focus as a reaction when they take damage (and gain EP from damage they take from the triggering attack, if appropriate).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entropy Points can be expended in various ways, some of which you gain through vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor Class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move your speed, you can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type you have).</li>\n<li>As a move action, you can expend EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack you make before the start of your next turn. You must decide how many EP to expend when you take this move action, and you can’t expend more EP than your level. If the boosted entropic strike hits, you deal +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li>\n</ul>",

Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike’s item level.<br><br>You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack’s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon’s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn’t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br><br>At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table below). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe’s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 141px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\"><strong>Entropic Strike Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">12th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">14th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">6d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">7d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">8d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">9d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">18th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">10d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">11d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 35px;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 106px;\">12d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

You can use a tactical shield to make unarmed attacks that do not count as archaic.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">When you wield a basic tactical shield, as a move action you can align the shield to grant you greater protection against one opponent you are observing, which grants you a +1 shield bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent until the beginning of your next turn. The field and advanced tactical shields grant you a +1 shield bonus to AC when wielded, though this does not increase when aligned against a target. The elite tactical shield increases the shield bonus when aligned against a target to +2, and the paragon tactical shield increases this to +3.</span></p>",

As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can’t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.<br><br>Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</span></p>",
