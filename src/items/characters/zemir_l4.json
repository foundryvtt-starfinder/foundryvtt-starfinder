Armed with ineffable resilience and keenly developed senses, you greet each new adventure with zeal and reverence, drinking in the world around you with boundless enthusiasm. Though not immune to fear, your openness strengthens your resolve when facing the unknown. You might approach new encounters with reckless abandon or take a more thoughtful path, but whatever route you choose, finding new sensations fulfills you.</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">1ST)</span></h2>\n<p>Always in search of new sensations, you have spent significant time learning about the cultures of the Pact Worlds and have gained a breadth of cultural knowledge, from the composition styles of Vercite ether-ballads to quantum-flavored Idaran cuisine or the latest textiles in Kalo-Mahoi fashions. Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about artistic innovations and traditions by 5. Given your propensity for trying new things, you’ve also found it prudent to understand the distinction between delightful experiences and those that are ill-advised, permanently injurious, or even fatal. Reduce the DC of Life Science checks by 5 when identifying consumables such as drugs, medicinals, poisons, food, and drink.</p>\n<p>Perception is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Perception checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation.</p>\n<h2>CHARMING CURIOSITY (6TH)</h2>\n<p>Your broad awareness provides you with insight when you try to influence people. This talent is valuable when you try to talk others into allowing you access to new experiences. Strangers might not understand your motivations, but your passion is contagious, and your ardent quest endears you to those who share your curiosity. Up to twice per day, you can roll twice when attempting a Diplomacy check and use the better of the two results.</p>\n<h2>FLASH OF COURAGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">12TH)</span></h2>\n<p>Though you want to have as many new experiences as you can, some encounters are so intimidating or dangerous that even you hesitate. After all, if a thrill resulted in serious injury or even death, it’s possible you could never feel a new sensation again! Despite the risk, you refuse to let fear stop you from seeing as much of the galaxy as your limits allow. You’ve successfully survived each moment of your life so far, haven’t you? With such an optimistic outlook toward the future, you gain a +1 morale bonus to Will saving throws against fear effects. In addition, once per day when you are affected by a fear effect, as a reaction, you can delay the onset of that effect for 1 round. Once the fear starts to affect you, it then has its normal duration from that point.</p>\n<h2>SENSATION JUNKY (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>New experiences fulfill and exhilarate you, stoking your enthusiasm for the wondrous galaxy you inhabit, the opportunities it presents, and all it has to offer. Twice per day, you can enjoy a new experience that takes 10 minutes or longer. As an alternative, you can spend 10 minutes or longer processing a recent new experience in some way. You might make a digital record or write in a physical journal, discuss the experience, debate whether you’d repeat it, bask in the satisfaction of fulfilling your curiosity, or engage in similar reflection. If you do so, you regain 1 Resolve Point. The time spent reflecting on your experience doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina.</p>"

          "value": "<p>Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond than any of their neighbor races—for better and for worse. They’ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Humans have a wide range of inherited traits, such as body type, skin color, and facial features, yet these minor differences of heredity and genetics hold little significance in modern human society. Instead, humans’ tendency to adapt to their environments means that more extreme differences, such as cybernetic augmentations, alien implants, and the elongated limbs of zero-g asteroid miners, are seen as far more important than ancient geography or skin color when defining modern ethnic groups. Still, certain ancient cultural groups are still recognized, such as the crimson-hued humans native to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton} and the mysterious, sinister humans of the Azlanti Star Empire.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Humans first arose on Golarion, yet even before the disappearance of their home world, they had begun to spread out onto the other planets of the solar system, particularly @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}. In the wake of Golarion’s vanishing, however, this group of explorers became inadvertent emigrants. Today, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} is the undisputed center of human culture, yet humans can be found on nearly every planet in the system, either integrated into alien societies or creating colonies and homesteads on new worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common races in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion’s disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To the majority, however, this approach is seen as backward—who cares about the dusty past on a vanished world when it’s the future that will make you or break you?</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>The diversity of human societies makes them both fascinating and frustrating to other races. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores, and one faction may promote violent, xenophobic conquest while another wants only trade and friendship. If there’s anything that can be said about human society as a whole, it’s that it’s always in flux, with even the oldest cultures constantly adapting and reinventing themselves—a trait that often leads to humanity being seen as a “younger” race, regardless of the millennia it has existed. As a result, humans cannot be said to lean toward any particular alignment—though many aliens might argue that this marks them as chaotic.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Humans are the glue that holds the rest of the solar system together. Their seemingly endless desire to explore and settle any habitable environment has positioned them perfectly to act as traders and mediators between other races, and their lack of their own planet often makes integrating into other cultures attractive to them. At the same time, not every race appreciates their viruslike spread. Vesk in particular keep a wary eye on humans—if only because humans’ tendency toward expansionism and violence track too closely to their own—and many androids retain a strained relationship with their parent race. Even the friendliest races remain aware of just how quickly a few humans in their midst can become a controlling majority.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Ambition and desire for action are hallmarks of humanity, and countless humans leave home in search of wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, or other means of bettering their situations. Since the discovery of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and convenient interstellar travel, humans have led the charge in exploring and settling new worlds, driven by economic opportunity and ambition. Due to their versatility and adaptability, humans can fill any role in an adventuring party, from heavily armed soldier to charming envoy ambassador.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments&nbsp;</strong>+2 to any one ability score</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5-7 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100-300 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age</strong> 80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Humans are Medium humanoids and have the human subtype.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feat</h2>\n<p>Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Skilled</h2>\n<p>Humans gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Alternate species traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em></p>\n<p>The cultural, genetic, and mystical influences that some humans are subjected to can produce species traits different from the norm.</p>\n<h2>Adopted</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong><em>COM pg. 18</em></p>\n<p>Many humans thrive in racially diverse metropolitan areas, and some individuals are adopted by members of a different species.

          "value": "<p>Most people believe that reality is limited to their physical surroundings. You know the truth: that everything around you is merely a thin veil draped across the infinite tapestry of existence. Your reality is a palimpsest, with all possible worlds and all alternate existences at your disposal. Through your magic and force of personality, you can peer into these time lines and pull from them as you see fit, using their dimensional echoes to twist and reshape your own world.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.wL8LqzXvlasiMXgI]{Spells (Witchwarper)}</h2>\n<p>You cast spells drawn from the witchwarper spell list. To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</p>\n<p>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.</p>\n<p>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.fqh91mM5CY6tJp4J]{Infinite Worlds (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.</p>\n<p>All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.</p>\n<p>You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.</p>\n<p>For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0JZU0FVnvAJ08fVR]{Paradigm Shift - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)</p>\n<p>The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.dxdsm79r49ZhYz6x]{Compound Sight (Su)- 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways. Choose a skill. You gain a +1 insight bonus to checks using that skill. This bonus increases by +1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. You can change your chosen skill every time you gain a witchwarper level. At 9th level, you become more adept with your compound sight and can choose two skills to apply it to.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.rzEUtUUfzmWA70oq]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.eHei2ofag7prMslj]{Alternate Outcome (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in your current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.</p>\n<p>You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.HtcqGXQZb4M1Nh69]{Unfold Existences (Su) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary. Select five paradigms shifts you don’t know but whose prerequisites you meet. These paradigm shifts must not require your level to be higher than 8th. You can use the selected paradigm shifts a total number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.w02UC2TbgcyE7zhX]{Reality Stutter (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your force of will can infuse reality itself, changing key aspects of existence around you. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn’t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can’t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.</p>"

Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li><strong>4th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>5th (Instantaneous):</strong>&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li>\n<li><strong>6th (Environmental):</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li>\n</ul>"

He gains a +1 bonus to Perception checks. This has already been factored into his statistics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Infinite Worlds (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into his current universe. He expends a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for 4 rounds unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, Zemir can create an instantaneous effect, such as a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless noted otherwise, effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules. They have a range of 140 feet and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + the spell level expended to create the effect. Zemir can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.</p>\n<p>Zemir can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When he does so, select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend. For example, Zemir could expend a 2nd-level spell slot to either create a 2nd-level effect or any two 1st-level effects.The environmental and instantaneous effects he can create by expending a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st (Environmental):</strong> Zemir causes the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. Zemir can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When he creates difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>1st (Instantaneous):</strong> Zemir causes a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 4 rounds. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Environmental):</strong> Zemir creates a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. Zemir selects the damage type each time he uses this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li><strong>2nd (Instantaneous):</strong> Zemir causes a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of Zemir’s choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Shift Resistance (Su)</strong> As a standard action, Zemir can change the type of a single energy resistance (but not immunity) of a creature within 100 feet (from cold to fire, for example) for 1 round. The creature can attempt a DC 17 Will save to negate this effect. Once he’s targeted a creature with this paradigm shift, Zemir can’t target that creature with this paradigm shift again for 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Focus</strong> This feat increases the saving throw DCs of Zemir’s spells by 1. This has already been factored into his statistics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spells</strong> Zemir can cast the following spells, each as a standard action (except as noted):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charm Person</span></em>: Zemir charms a humanoid creature within 35 feet unless they succeed at a DC 17 Will save. This makes the target regard him as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by Zemir or his allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus to its saving throw. Zemir can try to give the target suggestions, but he must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions. Any act by Zemir or his apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. Zemir must speak the creature’s language to communicate his suggestions, or else be good at pantomiming.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charming Veneer</span></em>: Zemir can cast this spell on a creature within 140 feet. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and a creature can only be affected by this spell once per 24 hours.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Comprehend Languages</span></em>: Zemir can understand the spoken or signed words of creatures or read incomprehensible written or tactile messages. He can read and understand an unknown language but cannot speak or write it. This lasts for 40 minutes.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Detect Magic</span></em>: This reveals whether creatures or objects seen within a 60-foot cone are magical and, with concentration, can determine whether one magical source is a spell, magic item, or other effect, and its caster level.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fear</span></em>: When Zemir casts fear as a 2nd-level spell, it targets one living creature of CR 4 within 140 feet, making that creature frightened for 1 minute (Will DC 18 negates). When cast as a 1st-level spell, it targets one living creature within 35 feet, making that creature frightened for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 17 negates).Ghost Sound: Zemir can create an illusory sound (DC 16 to disbelieve) within 35 feet that can be as loud as 20 normal humans.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hazard</span></em>: When Zemir casts this spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell gains that descriptor. Zemir summons a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid rain, a blast of freezing air, a static electric discharge, a burst of fire, or a roar of thunder in a 5-foot-radius burst within 35 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 16) or take 1d3 damage of the chosen type.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Psychokinetic Hand</span></em>: Zemir points his finger at an object within 35 feet that weighs 10 pounds or less (or up to 1 bulk), gaining the ability to lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, he can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Puncture Veil</span></em>: Zemir creates microscopic tears in reality that deal 1d4 piercing damage to a creature within 140 feet. The affected creature also gains the bleeding condition (1 damage) for 3 rounds. Zemir can instead cast this spell as a full action to either target two creatures within 20 feet of each other or to target one creature and deal 2d4 piercing damage, granting the bleeding condition (2 damage) for 3 rounds.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shifting Surge</span></em>: Zemir touches a willing creature and affects one of their energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of his next turn. Even if he doesn’t change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Slice Reality</span></em>: Zemir targets either one or two creatures within 140 feet. Each target takes 2d6 damage (DC 18 Fortitude for half). If Zemir targeted only one creature, that creature is also staggered for 4 rounds.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Token Spell</span></em>: Zemir can perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. He can slowly lift one item of light bulk. He can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, such as by coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. He can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they can’t be used as tools or weapons). He can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any effects last for the duration of the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> Zemir gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> Zemir adds his character level to damage dealt with basic melee weapons and half his character level to damage dealt with small arms. This has already been factored into his attacks above.</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic Lashunta Tempweave</strong> While wearing this armor, Zemir can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 4 days.Infrared Sensors This armor upgrade grants Zemir darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong> Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Static Arc Pistol</strong> This weapon can be fired 10 times before it needs to be reloaded (each shot uses 2 battery charges). It has a range increment of 50 feet</p>",
