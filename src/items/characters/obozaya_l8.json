        "value": "<p>In classic vesk fashion, Obozaya Ymeros lets her friends shorten her name to &ldquo;Obo,&rdquo; but not even Damoritosh himself can protect those who use her nickname without earning that right first.</p>\n<p>Obozaya was born on Vesk Prime, planetary capital of the Veskarium, to a family of low-level military bureaucrats. Distinguishing herself with her determination and ferocity on the sports field and in the dueling ring&mdash;if not in her academic studies&mdash;Obozaya established herself as a top-notch military cadet, enlisting as soon as her basic studies were complete.</p>\n<p>Obozaya took to military life, and soon outpaced many in her cohort. In Veskarium society, social status is most easily earned through excellence in combat, and Obo had no desire to spend her entire life at the same rank as her parents. Her dreams of glory were hardly unique, but she quickly proved herself in several battles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet in her youthful arrogance, Obozaya overlooked the power of political connections. After dueling and deeply shaming another member of her unit one with family ties to high-ranking military officials&mdash;she found herself assigned to patrol a section of frozen tundra on Vesk-8, where the pacifist residents refused to give her any opportunity for righteous combat. It soon became clear that neither appeals to her superiors nor prayers to Damoritosh the Conqueror were going to get her a better assignment. Thus, as her first term of enlistment drew to a close, she left the military.</p>\n<p>From there, Obozaya followed in the footsteps of many other legendary vesk warriors and left home to work as a mercenary in the Pact Worlds. Here, at last, she found what she&rsquo;d been searching for: an endless series of battles, with no restrictions but her own sense of honor. Rather than signing on with an established mercenary company, Obozaya worked primarily with small groups of explorers and adventurers. Small teams mean more glory per person, and she often finds herself the sole front-line fighter on a crew, which appeals to her vanity. As Obozaya&rsquo;s fond of saying, battle is too important to leave to amateurs, and she believes that the best way to win a fight is to move fast and hit hard. Though she has drifted away from Damoritosh&rsquo;s faith, she still adores using his sacred doshko for close-up fighting.</p>\n<p>Obozaya is a study in contrasts. While she appreciates material wealth and creature comforts, her true desire is for recognition. This is perhaps best exemplified by the holoprojector on her back, which usually projects a modified version of Damoritosh&rsquo;s symbol to advertise her as a warrior for hire, but which is capable of projecting a personalized holographic war-banner in combat to make sure the enemy knows exactly who&rsquo;s coming for them. Brilliant on the battlefield, Obozaya nevertheless finds herself a little slow on the draw in most intellectual pursuits, having little patience for any education not directly related to her vocation. She believes that honor demands honesty, and while she&rsquo;s not against lying by omission, she would rather die than break her word or renege on a contract. In conversations with new people, she&rsquo;s either unnervingly stoic or direct to the point of rudeness, and thinks that most species talk more than they need to as an attempt to cover up their cowardice.</p>\n<p>All of which makes it that much more surprising to discover how much her companions adore her. Sure, Obo may explain her loyalty as a mercenary&rsquo;s pragmatism, yet everyone in her crew knows they can count on &ldquo;the big lizard&rdquo; to pull them out of a scrape, no matter the cost. As with many vesk, her gruff manner is punctuated with sudden outpourings of emotion, and with her characteristic directness, Obo finds no fear or shame in telling her friends how much she loves them. Much of her life is spent on or training for missions, yet when she sets out to celebrate a success, it&rsquo;s with her trademark bombastic zeal. Eschewing the berserker drugs favored by some of her kindred, she&rsquo;s instead fond of the Veskarium nose-hookahs sometimes called &ldquo;dragon&rsquo;s breath,&rdquo; as well as the mildly hallucinogenic brain snails of Vesk-2 and other traditional vesk snacks. More than one bar has been sacrificed to (and well compensated for) her parties, and the heavy bass of her beloved revelaz dance-pop beats is notorious for bursting rivets on ship bulkheads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Armored Advantage </strong>Obozaya gains a +1 insight bonus to her KAC when wearing armor. This bonus has already been added to her Armor Class above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Charge Attack (Ex)</strong> Obozaya can charge as a standard action without taking the normal penalties for charging, and can substitute a bull rush for the attack at the end of her charge.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cleave </strong>Obozaya can take a &ndash;2 penalty to her AC until her next turn in order to use the Cleave feat. This allows her to make a melee attack against a foe adjacent to her as a standard action. If she hits, she can make a second melee attack against a different foe adjacent to both her and the first foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Coordinated Shot </strong>When Obozaya is threatening a foe with a melee weapon, any ally with line of sight to that foe without Obozaya granting the foe cover gains a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Deadly Aim </strong>When Obozaya takes the attack or full attack action with a weapon, she can take a &ndash;2 penalty to her attack rolls to add 2 to her damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Grunt </strong>Treat Obozaya&rsquo;s Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining her bulk limit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Low-Light Vision </strong>Obozaya can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Melee Striker </strong>Obozaya adds an additional bonus to her melee damage equal to half her Strength bonus. This is already added in to her attacks above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mobility </strong>Obozaya gains a +4 bonus to her AC against attacks of opportunity she provokes by moving out of a threatened square.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Natural Weapons </strong>Obozaya&rsquo;s unarmed attacks deal lethal damage and aren&rsquo;t considered archaic, and she adds 1-1/2 &times; her character level to the damage (rather than just adding her level with Weapon Specialization).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Quick Draw </strong>Obozaya can draw a weapon as a swift action.Step Up and Strike When a foe adjacent to Obozaya attempts to take a guarded step, as a reaction Obozaya can move up to 10 feet (as long as she ends adjacent to the creature taking the guarded step), and can make an attack of opportunity against that foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Weapon Specialization </strong>Obozaya adds her character level to the damage she deals with most melee weapons, longarms, heavy weapons, sniper weapons, and grenades, and half her character level to the damage she deals with operative melee weapons and small arms. This is already added in to her attacks above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Autotarget Rifle </strong>This two-handed rifle fires physical bullets and can be fired 10 times before it must be reloaded. As a full action, Obozaya can attack with it in automatic mode, using all its remaining ammunition and attacking multiple targets in a 30-foot cone. Beginning with the nearest target, Obozaya makes one attack roll against each target in the cone. This expends 2 rounds of ammunition per target attacked, and when the rifle runs out of ammunition, it can&rsquo;t target any more creatures. Obozaya rolls damage only once, applying it to all targets hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Blaze Flame Doshko </strong>This two-handed weapon has a battery with 20 charges and uses 1 charge per minute it&rsquo;s active.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Medpatch </strong>Obozaya can use this to attempt an untrained Medicine check with a +10 bonus to perform the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison task.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 1 Serum of Healing </strong>Drinking a vial of this serum restores 1d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Snub Scattergun </strong>This two-handed ranged weapon can be fired eight times before it must be reloaded. It targets all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Obozaya makes an attack roll against each creature in this area, then rolls damage only once and applies it to all creatures she hits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Targeting Computer </strong>The targeting computer in Obozaya&rsquo;s armor allows her to ignore the concealment (other than total concealment) of any target.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Vesk Overplate II </strong>While wearing this armor, Obozaya can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days.</p>",

          "chat": "",
          "gmnotes": "",
          "short": "",
          "value": "<p>Heavily muscled and covered with thick scales and short, sharp horns, the reptilian vesk are exactly as predatory and warlike as they appear. Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds&mdash;for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they&rsquo;ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate &ldquo;softer&rdquo; races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails&mdash;while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony &ldquo;beards&rdquo; that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that&rsquo;s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk&rsquo;s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who&rsquo;ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn&rsquo;t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding&mdash;especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk&rsquo;s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict&mdash;often called the Silent War&mdash;might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids&rsquo; dispassionate consistency, kasathas&rsquo; sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture&rsquo;s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>6-8 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>200-300 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>16 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>Armor Savant</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology. When wearing armor, they gain a +1 racial bonus to AC. When they&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor, their armor check penalty is 1 less severe than normal.</p>\n<h2>Fearless</h2>\n<p>Vesk receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Vesk can see in dim light as if it were normal light. For more details, see page 264.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p>Vesk can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1&ndash;1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate racial traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>Brawny</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible. They gain a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Cave Senses</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Vesk who grew up underground in twisted caverns have more sensitive hearing. They have low-light vision and gain blindsight (sound) 60 feet, but they take a &ndash;4 penalty to sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet and take a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls against targets beyond 60 feet in bright light.</p>\n<p>This replaces low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Expanded Lung Capacity</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk have extraordinary lung capacity. These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this racial trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a vacuum, or would otherwise begin suffocating or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Forceful Mind</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS<em> pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Frilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS<em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em><br />Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant.</p>\n<h2>Observant</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this racial trait select either Perception or Sense Motive. They gain a +3 racial bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This replaces fearless.</p>\n<h2>Prehensile Tail</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands&rsquo; worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p>This replaces natural weapons.</p>\n<h2>Vesk Venom</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em><br />Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this racial trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong>Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk&rsquo;s level + the vesk&rsquo;s Constitution modifier)<br /><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong>1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong>1/round for 6 rounds<br /><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong>Progression track is @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Healthy}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Sluggish}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Stiffened}&mdash;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.<br /><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong>1 save.

You take a –6 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.TpQFUzCF5V1DbDdi]{Kill Shot (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;As a standard action, you can make a single attack against an enemy. If the attack hits and does not kill your enemy, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to force the creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or die. Once you’ve used this ability on a creature (regardless of whether or not you forced it to attempt a Fortitude save), that creature is immune to your kill shot for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UeBhzdvvrqvroda0]{Aesthetic Warrior}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.XK3M0StmPA3blYw1]{Feat Boosts}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wLaosY545SkwlxrJ]{Special Ops Trainings}</p>",

You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GvubHqBOlV1CsWvz]{Hunter}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl10_LabelName\">You’re a master of hunting all sorts of creatures, from big-game animals to runaway criminals and similar marks. You may use this expertise as a sniper, trophy hunter, sport enthusiast, or fugitive tracer. Far more focused on skills than other soldiers, your unique talents combine experience in the field with refined combat ability.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2C2NBundSvw79yKG]{Qi Adept}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl12_LabelName\">You are able to tap into your personal life force, enabling you to unleash incredible strikes upon your foes.

You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.HiI3JMXX6crpsWDN]{Wrathful Warrior}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl17_LabelName\">The wrathful warrior style draws upon your emotions—specifically your rage and wrath—to enable devastating attacks. You may have trained yourself to intentionally overload your fight-or-flight adrenaline response, or may just come from a long line of berserker warriors.
