Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety of tasks. If there’s a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or destroyed, you’re the first on the scene. Whether you’re a skilled scientist, a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you’re no stranger to combat—but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for you.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.i7zwEHz2RWkZVOAM]{Artificial Intelligence (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex. You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.tB2crolmUBN3QMOT]{Bypass (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are skilled at getting inside computer systems and electronic devices. At 1st level, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Computers and Engineering skill checks. At 5th level, every 4 levels thereafter, and at 20th level, this bonus increases by 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.uWZ3LvxQ3yezLB4j]{Custom Rig (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic augmentation system in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. For more information on augmentations, see Chapter 7: Equipment. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.<br><br>If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.<br><br>You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier. If a mechanic trick requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × your class level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br>Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once. The list of mechanic tricks appears on page 71.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EE8KOT5324qTuW2o]{Overload (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.lOqPFn93aueiBQst]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AiYxJza4CVXPRjFz]{Remote Hack (Ex) - 5th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet. A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Perception or Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to determine that you are the origin of this activity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JQiKFSMXkqLMW98N]{Expert Rig (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls). In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of item level 6th or lower, and it has the features of a computer with a tier equal to half your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices. See page 213 for more information on computers.<br><br>You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder (see page 430) at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.D5vkMjJh78XE6KkS]{Miracle Worker (Ex) - 7th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can repair damage to a starship’s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently. To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor’s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Weapon</strong>: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Damaged Ship</strong>: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship’s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9H5hz8bMW0i0wz2x]{Override (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is not dazed and you can dictate its actions for 1 round, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UZMGMjpAwhGZNurI]{Coordinated Assault (Ex) - 11th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you have a drone, whenever both you and your drone make attacks against the same target, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack rolls. If you have an exocortex instead, whenever you and your exocortex are both attempting to hack a system, you each receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the checks to gain access. In either case, these bonuses increase to +2 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NtHGqPauPZauV7rc]{Advanced Rig (Ex) - 13th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus firewall countermeasure (see page 217). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.<br><br>In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.vaV8mCJdunfbWwQL]{Control Net (Ex) - 17th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in mechanic, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time). If the number of levels assigned to your exocortex is less than your mechanic level, your exocortex grants a smaller increase to your base attack bonus when using combat tracking (see page 79), as noted in the table below. You gain additional exocortex abilities, such as wireless hack and multitasking, based upon the level you assign to it as normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.clTAGasLWOe1pr4D]{Ghost in the Machine (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>When using your override class feature to affect an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not dazed, and you can instead dictate its actions for the next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack for 24 hours unless you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.GLFInMDKp2fLRpsG]{Superior Rig (Ex) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.<br><br>Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JSeOqPlZUkKA1KdT]{Tech Master (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 1 minute per item level or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 1 minute per item level. This uses the normal crafting rules presented on page 235, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a onehanded weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.JXuSLeps7hhNuSjh]{Experimental Armor Prototype}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9hIBsMSy3PmQzgus]{Experimental Weapon Prototype (Ex)}</p>"

          "value": "<p>Small and furtive, the ysoki are often overlooked by larger races. Yet through wit and technological prowess, they&rsquo;ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>Ranging from 3 to 4 feet tall, ysoki resemble humanoid rats who walk upright, complete with fur, long incisors, constantly twitching noses, and partially prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity. Their small, dexterous hands are perfect for working on delicate electronics, and their keen noses often allow them to identify complex chemicals by smell. Male and female ysoki are difficult for other races to tell apart, as they have similar body types and favor similar fashions.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>While the term &ldquo;ysoki&rdquo; originates from @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}, where the race has long been a vibrant and respected culture, populations of ratfolk (as they&rsquo;re sometimes called) existed on several worlds for millennia before spaceflight became common. Whether these different populations were examples of convergent evolution or they shared a common ancestor is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but today most of these cultures now identify as part of the overarching ysoki race. This is due partially to the wide variation in ysoki heredity, which makes ethnicity (and often even immediate family connections) almost impossible to determine by sight or genetics, but even more so to the fact that ysoki have done more than any other ratfolk group to demand and maintain the respect of larger races.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Ysoki society is chaotic and freewheeling, and a typical warren is full of half-finished projects and multiple ysoki talking over each other. Regardless of their role in society, nearly all ysoki hold a deep and abiding love for technology and gadgets, whether it be an engineer&rsquo;s love of taking machines apart or a soldier&rsquo;s appreciation for her armor&rsquo;s construction. While they traditionally take on roles and societal niches other races view as unpleasant, acting as junkers or squeezing through the innards of starships, this is due not to a lack of pride, but rather an abundance thereof&mdash;ysoki are so sure of their own worth that living in subpar conditions doesn&rsquo;t shame them. Larger races&rsquo; tendency to underestimate or pick on ysoki has left them fiercely loyal to their friends and families&mdash;both ysoki and otherwise&mdash;and a ysoki presented with a gross injustice often feels the need to fling himself teeth-first at the problem, consequences be damned. As a result, the most common ysoki alignment is chaotic good, though they can easily be tugged toward the evil alignments by loyalty or a need to strike back at perceived oppression (or even simple disrespect).</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Friendly and talented, ysoki integrate easily into most civilized societies, sometimes in all-ysoki neighborhoods and other times living side by side with alien cultures. The large size of ysoki families and their tendency to travel also means that a ysoki on a Pact World is shockingly likely to have a cousin or other contact in just about any major settlement. Of the major races, ysoki get along best with lashuntas, with whom they&rsquo;ve traded for millennia, though they appreciate humanity&rsquo;s pluck and shirrens&rsquo; devotion to community, even if the latter are a little too calm for ysoki tastes. They identify with androids&rsquo; defiance in the face of prejudice, but they find kasathas too aloof and @Compendium[sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} too obsessed with displaying dominance. Regardless of others&rsquo; races, ysoki pride themselves on being quick judges of character, and members of many other races have been surprised to find a ysoki fighting on their behalf after no more than a conversation in a crowded bar. Quick to rile and quick to forgive, fond of laughing at misfortune (both their own and others&rsquo;), ysoki can sometimes be exhausting, but they are rarely boring.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Though ysoki form strong bonds with their friends and families, these connections are as likely to take them off-world as to keep them at home. Many curious young ysoki sign on with starship crews to see the universe or find their fortunes, and soon adopt their shipmates as a second family. Their natural aptitude with machines most often leads ysoki to become mechanics and technomancers, but they also enjoy the gloriously complicated weaponry employed by operatives and soldiers, and many appreciate the quick-witted patter of envoys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Str<br /><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong>2</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong>3-4 ft.<br /><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong>60-100 lbs.<br /><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong>10 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong>60+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are Small humanoids with the ysoki subtype.</p>\n<h2>Cheek Pouches</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can see up to 60 feet in the dark. See page 263 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Moxie</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are scrappy and nimble even when the odds are against them. A ysoki can stand from prone as a swift action. Additionally, when off-kilter (see page 276), a ysoki does not take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the flat-footed condition. When attempting an Acrobatics check to tumble through the space of an opponent at least one size category larger than himself, a ysoki receive a +5 racial bonus to the check.</p>\n<h2>Scrounger</h2>\n<p>Ysoki receive a +2 racial bonus to Engineering, Stealth, and Survival checks.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Ysoki genetic diversity means cultures or individuals can have unusual traits, such as the following.</p>\n<h2>Blindsense</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Some ysoki can detect faint odors and tastes, granting them blindsense (scent) with a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p>This replaces darkvision.</p>\n<h2>Natural Weapons</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Ysoki can have long, sharp teeth. A ysoki with this trait is always considered to be armed. They can deal 1d3 lethal piercing damage with unarmed strikes, and the attack doesn&rsquo;t count as archaic. Ysoki with this trait gain a unique weapon specialization with their natural weapons at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1-1/2 &times; their character level to their damage rolls for their natural weapons (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<p>This replaces cheek pouches.</p>\n<h2>Scrappy</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Many ysoki are capable of taking and dealing surprising amounts of damage. A ysoki with this trait gains 4 racial Hit Points at 1st level instead of 2. In addition, while the ysoki has 0 Stamina Points, they gain a +1 insight bonus to melee attack rolls.</p>\n<p>This replaces moxie.</p>\n<h2>Skilled</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Ysoki with this trait gain an additional skill rank at 1st level and each level thereafter.</p>\n<p>This replaces scrounger.</p>\n<h2>Swarmer</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Swarmer ysoki use their small size to slip past defenses and strike at weak points. Ysoki with this trait gain the benefits of flanking an opponent provided at least one other ally is threatening that foe, regardless of position. Allies threatening the same enemy also gain the benefits of flanking.</p>\n<p>This replaces moxie and scrounger.</p>\n<h2>Wastelander</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 28</em><br />Since @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.gzXT0xwsj8kQAoj0]{Akiton}&rsquo;s economic crash, many ysoki on the Red Planet have been forced to make do with whatever they can scrounge. Ysoki with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to Survival checks and a +2 racial bonus to Fortitude saves against disease, poison, and effects that cause the nauseated or sickened condition.</p>\n<p>This replaces scrounger.</p>\n<div id=\"footer\">\n<div id=\"et-al\"></div>\n</div>"

You might have a code of ethics, never taking jobs that, say, target children or members of your own race. You might hunt down only escaped criminals. Or you might be completely amoral, taking any job that comes along&mdash;for the right price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)</h2>\n<p>Your mind is a cold steel trap when it comes to scraps of information about the creatures you&rsquo;re tracking down. Choose a specific sentient creature that you can identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be your mark. Reduce the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks to recall knowledge about your mark, as well as to recall knowledge about law-enforcement individuals and practices, by 5. If you choose a mark that is known only by an alias or secret identity, this ability helps you learn facts only about the identity you know about, not any other unknown identities. Once you defeat your mark, as an action that takes 1 minute, you can study dossiers and database information about another individual to be your new mark. You can instead abandon your mark for a new one without defeating it, but if you do so, you take a &ndash;2 penalty to all skill checks for 1 week. Survival is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SWIFT HUNTER (6TH)</h2>\n<p>You know just how to ask around about your marks to gain information and insight in a hurry. You can use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific individual in half the normal time, and you reduce the penalty for following tracks using Survival while moving at full speed to 0.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>RELENTLESS (12TH)</h2>\n<p>You never seem to get tired, even when working longer and harder than everyone else in pursuit of your mark; some of your targets might even refer to you as a tireless ghost or an all-seeing hunter. You can walk or be otherwise active for 12 hours instead of 8 before needing to attempt Constitution checks for a forced march (see page 258), and you can hustle for 2 hours a day during overland travel (see page 258) instead of 1 hour. Reduce the penalty for following tracks using Survival while moving at double speed to &ndash;10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MASTER HUNTER (18TH)</h2>\n<p>Your relentless pursuit of your mark steels your determination and can renew your inner reserves of strength. Once per day while in pursuit of your mark, you can review current information about your mark for 10 minutes to regain 1 Resolve Point; this doesn&rsquo;t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. Additionally, once per day when you defeat your ark, you regain 1 Resolve Point.</p>"

The GM has discretion over whether enough such objects are nearby to allow you to use this ability, but most urban and wilderness settings not specifically described as empty or barren have enough such material to allow at least one such temporary barricade to be built. The barricade grants partial cover against attacks with line of effect that pass through it. If the barricade is in a square that already granted partial cover, it instead grants normal cover.

While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Computers or Engineering skill check you attempt. Some mechanic tricks (see page 71) and drone mods (see page 77) require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit (see Chapter 7: Equipment). Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.<br><br>If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work.

If you hit, you deal 1d6 additional damage of the same type the weapon normally deals. This attack uses three times as many charges from the battery or power cell as normal and can’t be used if the weapon doesn’t have enough charges. This trick has no effect on a weapon without a battery or power cell. You can instead use this ability as a move action on a touched powered weapon that is unattended or attended by an ally to grant the same effect to that weapon’s next attack before the beginning of your next turn.</span></p>"

This makes the device nonfunctional for 1 round. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for 1 round. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier). Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>"

Programming a detonator to a specific package of explosives takes 1 minute, after which the detonator can be triggered in one of several ways. The detonator can be set to ignite its payload with the simple press of a button (no action), a four-digit command code (a move action), or a complex input method, such as scanning your retina or thumbprint (a full action). You choose the triggering method when setting the detonator. A detonator detonates its payload only if it is within 500 feet, but some detonators can make use of signal-boosting technologies at the risk of becoming vulnerable to countermeasures like signal jammers and other effects. Explosives have the same price, effect, and weight as grenades (see page 183). If you successfully set an explosive on a stationary object with a detonator using the Engineering skill, the explosive’s damage ignores half of the object’s hardness.&nbsp;</span></p>"

          "value": "<p>A grappler is a high-tech anchoring device that can be attached to a cable line as a move action. The cable line can instead be threaded through the grappler, which takes 1 minute but adds the cable line&rsquo;s hardness and HP to the hardness and HP of the grappler (and vice versa). A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136).<br /><br />You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that&rsquo;s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object&rsquo;s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it&rsquo;s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it.<br /><br />You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler&rsquo;s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple.<br /><br />A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.</p>"

        "value": "<h2>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>&nbsp;Quig has a flying drone he constructed himself. It acts after Quig&rsquo;s turn each round. If Quig takes no actions to control the drone, it can take only a standard action to attack or a move action to move up to its speed. If Quig takes a move action to control it, the drone can take a standard and move action. If Quig takes a move and swift action to control his drone, it can take a standard, move, and swift action, or a full action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Barricade&nbsp;</strong>As a move action, Quig can stack and reinforce objects too small to provide cover normally into a single adjacent square of partial cover. (The GM can rule that particularly barren areas lack the material needed to create a barricade.) If built in a square that already provided partial cover, the barricade instead provides cover. The barricade has hardness 13 and 13 Hit Points. If the barricade or a creature adjacent to it is hit by an attack, the barricade collapses 1d4 rounds later even if it has not yet been destroyed by damage. Normally there is not enough spare material to build a second barricade in the same square.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Boost Shield, Energy Shield</strong>&nbsp;As a standard action, Quig can use his expert rig to grant himself an energy shield. It gives him 20 temporary Hit Points and lasts for 8 minutes or until its Hit Points are depleted. Once he has used it, he can&rsquo;t activate it again until he takes a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. However, at any time he can spend 1 Resolve Point to restore all the shield&rsquo;s HP (even if it has been reduced to 0).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Bypass&nbsp;</strong>Quig gains a +2 bonus to Computers and Engineering checks. This has been added to his skill bonuses above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Cheek Pouches</strong>&nbsp;Quig can keep up to 1 cubic foot of items, weighing up to 1 bulk, in his cheek pouches. He can transfer a single item between his hand and a cheek pouch as a swift action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Darkvision&nbsp;</strong>Quig can see up to 60 feet in total darkness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Distracting Hack</strong>&nbsp;Quig can hack a computer within 30 feet of a foe (either through normal access or using his remote hack) to cause the computer to make a loud distracting sound or visual display. This works as the feint action, but uses Quig&rsquo;s Computer skill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Expert Rig</strong>&nbsp;Quig has a customized handheld toolkit he uses to hack systems and items. It functions as the appropriate tool for any Computers or Engineering checks he attempts. If it&rsquo;s destroyed, he can build a new expert rig from any technological toolkit with 1 hour of work. If Quig successfully hacks a computer with his expert rig, he can automatically disable any one security feature other than firewalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It also acts as a tier 4 computer with an artificial personality (named &ldquo;Little Scout&rdquo;). It has an audio/video recording, and can communicate with Quig&rsquo;s ship (or communicate with and give orders to Scout) at a range of 5 miles.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Improved Combat Maneuver (Disarm, Grapple)&nbsp;</strong>When Quig attempts a disarm or grapple combat maneuver, he gains a +4 bonus to his attack roll.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Miracle Worker</strong>&nbsp;Once per day as a move action, Quig can perform an amazing feat of engineering for a starship, armor, or weapon he can access. For a suit of armor, this increases its AC by 2 for 1 minute. A weapon gains a +2 bonus to its attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. For a starship, Quig restores a number of Hull Points equal to the starship&rsquo;s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship&rsquo;s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, he can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Moxie&nbsp;</strong>Quig can stand from prone as a swift action. When off-kilter, he does not take the normal penalties for that condition and is not flat-footed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overcharge&nbsp;</strong>As a standard action, Quig can use his expert rig to overcharge and fire an energy weapon (or melee weapon with the powered special property) in his possession, or as a move action he can overcharge a touched weapon (which is then overcharged for its next attack made before the end of Quig&rsquo;s next turn). An overcharged weapon&rsquo;s attack deals an additional 2d6 damage and uses three times as many charges as a typical attack with the weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Overload&nbsp;</strong>As a standard action, Quig can overload an adjacent technological item, such as a powered weapon or armor upgrade (though not a creature, or an object larger than Medium size). The item does not function for 1 round. If the item is in a foe&rsquo;s possession, that creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to negate this effect. Once a device is overloaded, a static charge prevents the object from being overloaded again for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Remote Hack</strong>&nbsp;Quig can use his expert rig to attempt Computers and Engineering checks at a range of 30 feet. A target of this ability (or someone observing the target) can attempt a DC 26 Perception or Sense Motive check to know Quig is the source of the remote hack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Swift Hunter</strong>&nbsp;Quig can use Diplomacy to gather information about a single creature in half the normal time, and he takes no penalty to Survival checks to follow tracks when moving at full speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Theme Knowledge</strong>&nbsp;Quig can select a specific sentient creature that he can identify by name, alias, or specific identity to be his mark. He reduces the DC of Culture or Profession (bounty hunter) checks to recall knowledge about his mark, as well as about law-enforcement individuals and practices. If he knows his mark by an alias, he can recall only knowledge associated with that alias.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong>&nbsp;Quig gains a +4 bonus to many Constitution checks to avoid damage or negative consequences from harsh environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p><strong>Corona Laser Pistol</strong>&nbsp;This pistol can be fired 20 times before its battery must be recharged or replaced. Quig has two extra batteries, which can be used in this or Scout&rsquo;s weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Detonator&nbsp;</strong>A detonator can be wired to an explosive in 1 minute, and set to detonate the explosive within 500 feet with the push of a button (no action if done on Quig&rsquo;s turn, or a reaction), a command code (a move action) or a complex action such as a retinal scan (a full action). The detonator can be used 5 times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Explosives&nbsp;</strong>Quig has a number of explosives designed to work with his detonator. These have the same cost, weight, and effect as grenades, but must be activated with a detonator rather than thrown. He has one frag III (explode [15 ft., 4d6 P, DC 18]), two stickybomb II explosives (explode [15 ft., entangled 2d4 rounds, DC 15]), and two flash I explosives (explode [5 ft., blinded 1d4 rounds, DC 15]).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Grappler&nbsp;</strong>The grappler is attached to 50 feet of adamantine alloy cable line, and can be climbed as easily as a knotted rope. It can also be attached to an immobile object at least 5 feet wide with a ranged attack (+10) against AC 5. Against a smaller or moving object, attaching it requires a ranged attack against KAC + 8. If it&rsquo;s attached to a creature, this is a grapple combat maneuver, but the creature can still use all its limbs and is only prevented from moving farther away than the length of the cable. The grappler can be pried loose with a successful Athletics check with a DC equal to Quig&rsquo;s attack roll to attach it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kasatha Microcord III&nbsp;</strong>While wearing this armor, Quig can close its environmental seals and survive in a vacuum (or other harsh environment) for up to 8 days. Its jetpack allows him to fly with a speed of 30 feet. It has a capacity of 40, and Quig can use 1 charge per minute to fly in cruising mode (causing him to be flat-footed and off-target), or expend 2 charges per round to fly without those conditions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Mk 2 Serum of Healing</strong>&nbsp;Drinking a vial of this serum restores 3d8 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Ampoule of Make Whole</strong>&nbsp;Quig can inject this spell ampoule into Scout (or another construct) to restore 5d6 Hit Points to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
