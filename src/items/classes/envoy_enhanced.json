      "value": "<p>You make your way in the universe with a charming smile, quick wit, and keen sense of self-preservation, and excel at getting others to do what you want. You might be a trickster, hustler, or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or businessperson, paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick. You are often the group’s strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in diplomacy, serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems or gaining audiences with local politicians or warlords.</p>\n<p>An envoy’s skill mastery and decisive leadership make any expedition stronger. The enhanced envoy preserves the class’s existing talents while focusing on its versatility and gameplay by granting an additional improvisation, better blending attacks with class abilities, and encouraging an envoy to dive into the action, inspiring comrades by example.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hIhgdXnqGHBm0A64]{Envoy Improvisation - 1st Level}</h2><p>As you gain experience, you learn envoy improvisations—little tricks that bolster allies, confound enemies, or change the ebb and flow of battle using guile, inspiration, or luck. You learn your first envoy improvisation at 1st level, and you learn an additional improvisation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. The list of envoy improvisations appears on page 62.</p>\n<p>If an improvisation allows you to grant an effect to an ally, you cannot grant yourself that effect unless the improvisation states otherwise. If an envoy improvisation allows a saving throw to resist its effects or requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + half your envoy level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Some envoy improvisations are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD.JournalEntryPage.Et5Wi1ityPgChozU#language-dependent]{Language-Dependent}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD.JournalEntryPage.Et5Wi1ityPgChozU#mind-affecting]{Mind-Affecting}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD.JournalEntryPage.Et5Wi1ityPgChozU#sense-dependent]{Sense-Dependent}, or some combination of any or all of these. These terms are defined on page 270.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.OzwMoyrdE3fcNZLP]{Expertise (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2><p>You are an expert at dealing with challenges that test your skills, be the challenges social or otherwise. At 1st level, when attempting a Sense Motive check, you can roll 1d6 (your expertise die) and add the result of the roll to your check as an insight bonus. You can use this and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d8 as your expertise die instead of 1d6.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level, you have even greater expertise with skills to which you can add your expertise die that you have also selected with the Skill Focus feat. For each such skill, once per day when rolling your expertise die to add to that skill, you may roll the expertise die twice and take the better of the two results.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.0HPp0nK0L1VawPYN]{Skill Expertise (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2><p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can use expertise with one additional class skill. You must have at least 1 rank in a skill to select it, and it must come from the following list: Bluff (Cha), Computers (Int), Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Engineering (Int), Intimidate (Cha), and Medicine (Int).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.xP24Q4B1FIw4UhPF]{Inspiring Combo (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2><p>You have learned to synergize your combat actions with acts that inspire your allies or adapt to the current tactical situation. As a full action, you can both make a single attack and use one envoy improvisation you know. The improvisation must be one you can use as a standard action, move action, or swift action. You choose in which order to resolve these actions. Once you use this ability, roll 1d10 and subtract your Charisma modifier ([[/r max(1, 1d10 - @abilities.cha.mod)]]{1d10 - Charisma Modifier}); you cannot use this ability again for a number of rounds equal to the result (minimum 1 round).</p>\n<p>At 10th level, as a full action, you can instead make either two attacks and use an envoy improvisation, or one attack and use two different envoy improvisations. You take a –4 penalty to your attack rolls until the end of the turn, and you treat your envoy level as 4 lower for the purpose of resolving the improvisations’ effects. If you use an improvisation that also allows you to make an attack, you increase the penalty to attack rolls to –6.</p>\n<p>At 19th level, you reduce the penalty for making multiple attacks with this ability by 2, and you treat your envoy level as only 2 lower for the purpose of resolving the improvisations’ effects.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.uovQ0gfZy060ktw0]{Signature Support (Ex) - 2nd Level}</h2><p>You’ve developed a knack for giving a specific type of midcombat encouragement. At 2nd level, choose one of the following envoy improvisations: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.YMCpBDLSA6feLBen]{Clever Feint}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.spGhGxCjrJUQP9v8]{Dispiriting Taunt}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.bP820PAOJUQ1dcLP]{Get ‘Em}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.4i1U9YQgb2tgN748]{Inspiring Boost}. If you do not have that improvisation already, you gain it. If you do have it, you can instead gain a different improvisation for which you qualify.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use the chosen improvisation as though you had spent 1 Resolve Point without having to spend a Resolve Point. You can do this once per day for every 6 envoy levels you have.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DR8JvF0xiwsXggxj]{Expertise Talent - 3rd Level}</h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose an expertise talent, which gives you an extra option when using a skill with which you have expertise. The list of expertise talents appears on pages 269–270.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.7KlK63jbcKN0zJLr]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) (Envoy) - 3rd Level}</h2><p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.9j7gwwrcvSqlOc1p]{Lead By Example (Ex) - 11th Level}</h2><p>Your personal victories are contagious, inspiring nearby allies. When you score a critical hit on your turn within view of at least one of your allies, you can use any envoy improvisation you know as a reaction before the end of your turn. The improvisation must be one that you can normally perform as a standard action, move action, or swift action, and this ability does not enable you to use an improvisation more often than you would normally be able to (such as if you’ve already expended all daily uses of an improvisation). Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again for 1 minute, or until an ally you can see within 60 feet scores a critical hit (though you must then score your own critical hit to use this ability again), whichever comes first.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.SWyStgFngZObkxHV]{Success Breeds Success (Ex) - 14th Level}</h2><p>Over time, you’ve learned to chain you and your allies’ most impressive accomplishments into even more stunning victories, granting you several abilities.</p>\n<p>When an ally you can see within 60 feet scores a critical hit on an attack against a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.LbTcOixt155snCxE.JournalEntryPage.k9Gve90er7bp808w#significant-enemies]{Significant Enemy}, attacks against that enemy are treated as a critical hit if the die roll is a natural 19 or 20 until the end of combat. If a different ally you can see within 60 feet scores a second critical hit against this enemy, attacks against that enemy are treated as a critical hit if the die roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20 until the end of combat. This continues to stack, with each unique ally who scores a critical hit against that enemy lowering the range of natural die rolls treated as a critical hit by one.</p>\n<p>In addition, the first time each combat that you succeed at a skill check, attack, or other d20 roll required by one of your envoy improvisations, or the first time each combat that you grant a benefit tied to a d20 roll to an ally who then succeeds at that roll, you gain 1 Resolve Point; this can’t cause you to gain more Resolve Points than your maximum.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.3PDrv9AcAX9p4gzg]{True Expertise (Ex) - 20th Level}</h2><p>You gain total mastery over one of your envoy improvisations and can use it with but a thought. When you gain this ability, choose one improvisation you know that has an effect when you spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can gain the improvisation’s effect without spending the Resolve Point. This ability has no benefit if the improvisation requires more than 1 Resolve Point.</p><h2>Alternate Class Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hBxvwY1SxmxTNRXk]{Combat Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.QaeRFGtNZ0OoKdbF]{Magical Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.a14dTDNr3SSInCHx]{Motivation Expertise (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.n4lSAvGX5mYztrU3]{Polymorphic Disguise (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.M2lelEywtGorjR0r]{Psychic Expertise}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.rScW5xGzTF62Xhdy]{Signature Item (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.2a88rr5iDbKC8jFo]{Spell Speaker (Su)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DRG3bJiyOLEq0kff]{Tech Whisperer (Ex)}</p>"
