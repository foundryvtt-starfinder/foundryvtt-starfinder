      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">Most people believe that reality is limited to their physical surroundings. You know the truth: that everything around you is merely a thin veil draped across the infinite tapestry of existence. Your reality is a palimpsest, with all possible worlds and all alternate existences at your disposal. Through your magic and force of personality, you can peer into these time lines and pull from them as you see fit, using their dimensional echoes to twist and reshape your own world.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wL8LqzXvlasiMXgI]{Spells (Witchwarper)}</h2>\n<p>You cast spells drawn from the witchwarper spell list. To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br><br>Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br><br>You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br><br>You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.fqh91mM5CY6tJp4J]{Infinite Worlds (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br><br>All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br><br>You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br><br>For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.0JZU0FVnvAJ08fVR]{Paradigm Shift - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)<br><br>The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.dxdsm79r49ZhYz6x]{Compound Sight (Su)- 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways. Choose a skill. You gain a +1 insight bonus to checks using that skill. This bonus increases by +1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. You can change your chosen skill every time you gain a witchwarper level. At 9th level, you become more adept with your compound sight and can choose two skills to apply it to.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rzEUtUUfzmWA70oq]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.eHei2ofag7prMslj]{Alternate Outcome (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in your current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.<br><br>You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.HtcqGXQZb4M1Nh69]{Unfold Existences (Su) - 19th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary. Select five paradigms shifts you don’t know but whose prerequisites you meet. These paradigm shifts must not require your level to be higher than 8th. You can use the selected paradigm shifts a total number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.w02UC2TbgcyE7zhX]{Reality Stutter (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p>Your force of will can infuse reality itself, changing key aspects of existence around you. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn’t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can’t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.<br><br>Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.</p>",
