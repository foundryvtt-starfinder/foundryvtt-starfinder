      "value": "<p>Through some cosmic event, you have come to understand the ebb and flow of time to a degree that only a select few can. You manipulate time dexterously&mdash;accelerating, slowing, or even reshaping chronologies to suit your needs. The skeins of time are yours to see, and you know how to apply enough pressure to adjust their threads ever so subtly. Your ability to understand the infinite possibilities of time also shaped you into someone capable of altering the material universe through powerful spellcasting, and you can harness temporal paradoxes to foresee the future&mdash;and dictate the present&mdash;in powerful ways.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"fontstyle0\">WEAPON PROFICIENCY</span></h4>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Basic melee weapons, small arms, and one of the following: advanced melee weapons, longarms, or sniper rifles.<br /><em>You must go in to the Details tab and add your selected weapon proficiency.</em><br /></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rlUBhTsjVbNGAlCL]{Spells}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can cast spells drawn from the precog spell list (which is described in greater detail on pages 61&ndash;64). To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Intelligence modifier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day can be found in Table 1&ndash;1: Precog above. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown in Table 1&ndash;2: Precog Bonus Spells (page 10)&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new precog level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&ndash;3: Precog Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the numbers of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Dexterity modifier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can cast any precog spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YYa7DxMT5jHkWtsm]{Anchor - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You have a preternatural affinity for an aspect of time itself that grants you power. Your anchor grounds your ability to interact with time and provides the foundation of all your powers. The exact nature of your specific anchor might be specific to you or be a broad element shared by other precogs. You must pick an anchor upon taking your first level of precog&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. The anchors you can choose from begin on page 11.</span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Focal Paradox </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">1st Level</span></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Your anchor provides you a particular aptitude when using your </span></span></span><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">paradox ability (below).</span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Improved Anchor </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">9th Level</span></span></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You gain increased competence channeling your anchor into a powerful effect.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Greater Anchor </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">15th Level</span></span></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Your mastery of your anchor provides you an exceptional ability.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.BOut7Wi1oWcnsEf3]{Paradox (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Your unique relationship with time allows you to dexterously manipulate its flow at key moments, allowing you to know what&rsquo;s going to happen before it transpires.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Each day when you regain your spell slots, you also gain a number of paradoxes equal to 1 + half your Dexterity modifier (minimum 2) and lose any unused paradoxes from the previous day. Whenever you gain these or any other paradoxes, roll 1d20 for each and record the result associated with that paradox. You can never reroll paradoxes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Many precog abilities allow you to use a paradox in place of a specific d20 roll you would make, using the paradox&rsquo;s associated result instead of rolling a random result. The paradox functions in every way like a normally rolled die; a paradox of 1 functions as a natural 1, and a paradox of 20 functions as a natural 20. You can&rsquo;t use a paradox for a die that has already been rolled or rerolled, and you can&rsquo;t reroll a paradox. Some precog abilities simply require you to use a paradox without using its associated result. Regardless of how you use a paradox, it is lost and can&rsquo;t be used again.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 1st level, you can use a paradox in place of your d20 roll for an ability score check or caster level check. In addition, you can use a paradox on a d20 roll associated with your anchor&rsquo;s focal paradox; once per day when you do, you immediately gain a new paradox.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 3rd level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are trained).</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 5th level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your attack rolls, Fortitude and Will saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are untrained).</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.unJ8E4IikZUxT7x3]{Temporal Anomalies (Su) - 2nd Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Temporal anomalies represent your ability to channel your unique relationship with time into tangible actions. You learn your first temporal anomaly at 2nd level, and an additional temporal anomaly every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a temporal anomaly last for a number of rounds equal to your precog level. If a temporal anomaly allows for a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your precog level + your Dexterity modifier.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn a given temporal anomaly more than once. The list of temporal anomalies begins on page 12.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.xEBfm4bN4qjEOD6n]{Chronomatic Defence (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You can execute precisely timed moves that help you and others dodge incoming attacks. As a reaction when an attack is declared but before the result is known, you can use a paradox to grant an ally an insight bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. This bonus is equal to the paradox result or a maximum bonus of +2, whichever is lower. The maximum bonus increases to +3 at 7th level, +4 at 13th level, and +5 at 18th level.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.3XFg5oL5z91TN3yP]{Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.LcjwIZqFNztVxkjH]{Temporal Aggression (Su) - 4th Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You can view possible timelines and choose the precise moment that will inflict the most grievous injury upon your foes. When you roll damage dice, you can use a paradox in place of rolling any one damage die. If you do so, treat the result as either the value of the paradox or the maximum result of the damage die, whichever is lower. For example, you could use a paradox of 11 in place of a d10 damage die to get a value for 10 for that damage die. You can use this ability multiple times per damage roll, but only once per damage die.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">At 6th level, you can use this ability to replace an adjacent ally&rsquo;s damage dice.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2SMy4mujW8seDrrq]{Paradoxical Acceleration (Su) - 10th Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">You learn how to burn your personal reserves of energy to fuel a greater view of the timeline. As a standard action, you can spend 3 Resolve Points to gain 1 paradox.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YyPuFG9HFQbKHK3U]{Chronomatic Flow (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Through your knowledge of time&rsquo;s flow, you can cast your spells with the exact timing necessary for maximum effect. As a swift action, you can use a paradox to increase the save DC on a spell you cast during your turn. This increase is equal to the paradox result or a maximum bonus of 1, whichever is </span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">lower. The maximum bonus increases to 2 at 16th level and 3 at 19th level.</span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.OTAjTbcBmSlcj4xY]{Timeless Paragon (Su) - 20th Level}</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You exist in perfect synchrony with your timeline, gaining an impressive degree of control over your existence. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per week, you can act as though benefiting from a mnemonic editor, allowing you to change up to 2 character levels&rsquo; worth of decisions. Once per month, you can perform the same action, though you can change up to 10 character levels&rsquo; worth of decisions. Once per year, you can change up to 20 levels&rsquo; worth of your decisions. Through all of these changes, you can&rsquo;t change your class levels in precog.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Furthermore, once per week, you can cast </span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">rewrite time </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(page 81) as a spell-like ability.</span></p>"
