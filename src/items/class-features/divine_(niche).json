You channel planar energy through your body, becoming aligned with a specific outer plane but also opening yourself to harm from those aligned with its opposite. In time, you aim to complete your transformation into an outsider of the outer planes, such as an angel, azata, demon, or devil.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmentation Type:</strong> Magitech<sup>AR</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Class Skill:</strong> Mysticism</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.gL5d6diJlk9Y4ONg]{Instinct}:</strong> Select one of the following broad categories of outsider that you wish to become. Each is associated with an alignment and opposed to an alignment; you must be of the associated alignment to select that category. Once made, this choice can’t be changed.</p><ul><li><p>Celestial (associated alignment: good; opposed alignment: evil)</p></li><li><p>Entropic (associated alignment: chaotic; opposed alignment: lawful)</p></li><li><p>Fiendish (associated alignment: evil; opposed alignment: good)</p></li><li><p>Resolute (associated alignment: lawful; opposed alignment: chaotic)</p></li></ul><p>As long as you have 1 or more Mutation Points, your body becomes imbued with the divine energy of your associated alignment, causing the following effects. Your adaptive strike becomes aligned with your associated alignment; damage from your adaptive strike bypasses DR that can be overcome by your associated alignment, and it ignores the energy resistance of outsiders of your opposed alignment. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells cast by an outsider of your opposed alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.sKWVslFaJuw9hCRp]{Drawback}:</strong> As your body becomes a vessel for divine energy, you become weakened by opposing forces. While you have at least 1 MP, you have vulnerability to damage aligned with your opposed alignment. Additionally, if you fail a saving throw against a spell cast by an outsider of your opposed alignment, you also take damage equal to half your evolutionist level + your MP total. While you have at least 3 MP, your body burns from the inside out from channeling more divine power than you can safely handle. On each of your turns, after you gain MP at the start of your turn, you’re dealt fire damage equal to the number of MP you have over 3. This damage bypasses any resistances and immunities you have and can’t be reduced in any way.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.zRa2NxRgVuSgWFgr]{Bolstering Aura (1st Level)}:</strong> You release a fraction of the divine energy contained within your body, radiating it out from you to bolster your spiritual allies. As a move action, you can generate a 30-foot-radius aura of divine energy. Creatures in the area that are of your associated alignment gain a +1 divine bonus to attack rolls and Will saving throws. This aura lasts for 3 rounds. When this aura would end, you can spend MP to prolong its duration by 1 additional round; this costs 1 MP plus an additional MP for each previous round you have extended this effect. At 10th level, the bonus increases to +2. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.fGXgo1DrR3xGMrrJ]{Scour Soul (10th Level)}:</strong> As a standard action, you can inundate an area with divine energy, scouring away all those opposing your values. This area is a 20-foot radius burst that originates at a point within 100 feet of you. The divine energy deals 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 slashing damage for every 2 evolutionist levels you have (Reflex saving throw for half damage). This damage has the descriptor appropriate for your associated alignment. Creatures of your associated alignment are immune to the damage dealt by this ability. You can spend 2 MP to change the fire damage to another one of the following damage types of your choice: acid, cold, electricity, or sonic.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.zZg99NXlon2kFm4Y]{Niche Metamorphosis (20th Level)}:</strong> Your creature type becomes outsider with your choice of the following subtype: aeon, agathion, angel, archon, azata, daemon, demon, devil, inevitable, or protean. You gain immunity to petrification and poison.</p>"
