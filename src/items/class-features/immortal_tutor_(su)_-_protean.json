If you do so, you can reroll one of the damage dice and use the second result.<br /><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.c3Fr6XCwO9E353Il]{Second Lesson}:</strong>&nbsp;You reduce the damage you take from a critical hit by twice your technomancer level and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against the attack&rsquo;s critical hit effects.<br /><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.LLsIYqImeXieZ3lm]{Third Lesson}:</strong>&nbsp;Your form becomes extremely fluid. You gain the compression ability (Alien Archive 153), can move through difficult terrain as though it were normal terrain, and gain a +3 circumstance bonus to KAC and saving throws against attacks of opportunity and effects that would grapple or entangle you.</p>\n<p><em>Edit spell in the Details tab.<br />Spell Preperation should be set to Always Available.
