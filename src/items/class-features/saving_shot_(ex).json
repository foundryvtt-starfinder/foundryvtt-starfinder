Make a ranged attack with your bow and compare the result to the triggering attack’s result. If your roll is greater than the triggering attack’s result by 4 or less, the attacker rerolls the attack and uses the new result. If your attack roll exceeds the triggering attack’s result by 5 or more, the triggering attack misses. If the triggering attack was made with a grenade and would miss, you can choose a new target for the grenade that is within 20 feet of its original target. This ability can’t deflect unusually large projectiles, such as starship attacks, boulders, or large missiles.</p>"
