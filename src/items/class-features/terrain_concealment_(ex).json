If you have partial cover or cover and would be hit by an attack or fail a Reflex save, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to increase the cover’s bonus to your AC and Reflex saves by 2 against that effect; this ability can cause the attack to miss or cause your saving throw to succeed. If an attack would hit you while you have concealment, but the miss chance for concealment hasn’t yet been rolled, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to increase the miss chance for concealment by 10% (maximum 35% miss chance). If the triggering attack misses, you can immediately take a guarded step.</p>"
