Once per day as a standard action, you can target a living creature with a special biohack that counts against your total uses of biohacks and otherwise functions as a biohack. If you hit your target, they are affected by a 1st-level @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.gNgdSyi4pXQmasmc]{Polymorph}spell; an unwilling creature can negate the effect with a successful Fortitude save. Your caster level for this effect is equal to your biohacker level, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score. As you advance in biohacker levels, your morphing hack becomes more potent; increase thepolymorphspell level to 2nd when you reach 5th level, and by one additional spell level for every 3 biohacker levels you have (maximum 6th level at 17th level).</p>\n<p>When you select this theorem, select a single polymorph form according to the guidelines for the spell on page 145 ofAlien Archive 2. Every time you use this ability, the target turns into the polymorph form you have chosen. Each time you gain a biohacker level, you can select a new form for this theorem, replacing the old one. You can select this theorem multiple times, with each additional theorem giving you an additional daily use of this biohack and an additional polymorph form for the biohack.</p>"
