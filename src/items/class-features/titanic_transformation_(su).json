Once you leave either form, you cannot resume that form again until you rest to recover spell slots, even if using an ability like the Polymorph Adept (Alien Archive 2 145) feat.</p>\n<p>In your terrestrial form, you transform into a Colossal version of one of the 6th-level forms you know. This increases your space to 30 feet and increases your melee reach by 10 feet (minimum 20 feet, maximum 30 feet). Your form’s natural attacks each deal 6 additional damage; furthermore, the range of its special senses double, its enhancement bonus to Strength-based skill checks increases to +5, and you gain 30 temporary Hit Point that disappear when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>In your starfaring form, you transform into a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starships.Actor.s0OHg4GWSLspuL8r]{Living Starship} with the statistics presented. You can choose your appearance and the weapons’ forms, but their statistics do not change. You can use your own gunnery modifier, skill check modifiers, and skill ranks in place of those provided by this form. When determining critical damage effects and conditions (Core Rulebook 321), use the critical damage effect table given as an example on page 128 of the Starship Operations Manual.</p>\n<p>You can’t carry passengers or install systems or upgrades while in your starfaring form.</p>\n<p>You retain this form for the duration of one starship encounter, and if you assume this form while aboard a friendly starship, you are immediately shunted outside of the starship to an adjacent hex of your choice. The spell ends if your starship form is disabled. When the spell ends, you gain 5 temporary negative levels, minus 1 temporary negative level for every 80 Hull Points you have &nbsp;remaining.</p>"
