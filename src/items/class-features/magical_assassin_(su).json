As a move action, you can magically imbue one small arms or basic melee weapon with the operative weapon special property you’re wielding, treating it as a magic weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. In addition, when you imbue your weapon, choose one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When you attack with your imbued weapon as a standard action, before making the attack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 20 + your target’s CR. If you succeed, you deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen energy type. This increases to 1d6 at 3rd level, to 3d6 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d6 every 2 levels thereafter. Your weapon remains imbued for 1 minute, until you imbue another weapon, or until the end of your turn if you cease wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, when you imbue your weapon, you can also choose one of the following weapon fusions: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Do0w6So0C40HqhER]{Anarchic}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Iep4sqgx3KuTe97f]{Axiomatic}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.fsu2lyuyH9LUmDyz]{Defiant}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.I2UF2A0caxvNXXgK]{Dispelling}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.9bJcypS8Yq7gt9Vk]{Charge Disrupting}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.3Z4TivImf47FA1fn]{Durable}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.5KsmBkidShbIetHD]{Holy}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.5TkhBOwRywuI1hy5]{Merciful}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.lwWMVKatML2oimTk]{Seeking}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.21qnSrGH3lk8ivBI]{Unholy}. While imbued, the weapon gains and automatically activates the chosen fusion, even if this fusion would exceed the number of fusions the weapon could normally accommodate, though the fusion must be one that could normally be applied to the weapon. At 10th level, you can also choose from the following fusions: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.tXg2Qct6wWKXvzFW]{Corrosive}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.xCFWNmEQCMP2pbBo]{Flaming}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.1dzuG0GcJFvkdHrO]{Frost}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.j5zkM0udl7baRuG1]{Ghost Killer}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.a4PQiyAL5a24oKYi]{Shock}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.IbC1GFdWsUKKseRs]{Thundering}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.78g7h7nN3gWIY4ut]{Wounding}. At 17th level, you can apply two of these fusions to your imbued weapon at one time.</p>\n<p><strong>This alternate class feature replaces trick attack, debilitating trick, and double debilitation.</strong></p>"
