Your selection of spell amps is limited to a number of spells equal to 3 + half your biohacker level; these spells must fulfill all the requirements for a spell amp as detailed on page 224 of theStarfinder Core Rulebook. These spells comprise the list of spell amps you can create with this ability. Each time you gain a biohacker level, you can swap out one spell on this list for another spell that qualifies. Whenever you gain an even-numbered biohacker level, you also select one additional spell to add to your list of spell amps.</p>\n<p>The first time each day that you create your biohacks, you can create two 0-level spell amps and one 1st-level spell amp from your list. At 8th level, you also can prepare one 2nd-level spell amp from your list. Your spell amps are highly experimental and provide a benefit only when either consumed by you or when an imbiber also spends 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to consume the spell amp. You can inject these spell amps as though they were biohacks, though you must expend 1 Resolve Point and a biohack to do so.</p>"
