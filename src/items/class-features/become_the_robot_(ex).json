Affected constructs barely notice you, taking a –4 penalty to Perception checks to observe you and having a starting attitude of indifferent toward you. The first time a construct observes you, it can attempt a Will save to see through the disguise, becoming immune to its effect for 24 hours if it succeeds; a construct applies its Intelligence modifier to this Will save, making unintelligent constructs especially easy to fool. A construct can attempt an additional saving throw to become immune to the effect if it observes you performing prohibited actions, like trying to enter a highly restricted area or rigging explosives. A construct automatically succeeds at the saving throw if it observes blatantly hostile actions, like your attacking one of its allies. You can maintain this improvisation for up to 1 hour, after which you need to stretch and move normally for an equal amount of time before you can use the improvisation again.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point and use this ability as a full action to grant its effects to a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier. The effect ends for an ally if they end their turn without line of sight to you.</p>"
