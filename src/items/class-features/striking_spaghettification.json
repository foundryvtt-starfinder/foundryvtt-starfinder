While you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.6ROyFIpOxKzCynH1]{Lunge} as a bonus combat feat. When you use Lunge, you can instead increase the reach of your melee attacks by up to 5 feet for every 5 solarian levels you have. The resulting penalty to your Armor Class instead equals 1 + 1 for every 5 feet by which you extended your reach.</p>\n<p>If you hit a creature while using Lunge, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to pull the rest of your body toward the target, rather than retracting your limbs. This moves you to a space adjacent to the target that is within your reach and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
