You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.XYB8XWFhlWPMRwqR]{Coordinated Aim (Ex) (1st)}</h2>\n<p>You can help squad mates hit targets even if youâ€™re in the way. You gain Coordinated Shot as a bonus feat. Your allies gain the bonus even if you are providing cover to the target. If you already have that feat, you gain a bonus combat feat instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.QQlIHPja5I2NjTEx]{Quick Backup (Ex) (2nd)}</h2>\n<p>As a full action, you can move up to twice your speed and make one attack, but your target must be a creature threatening an ally. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have taken a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Fsi7v1vkYUir2ulS]{Mystic Swap (Su) (3rd)}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to teleport, switching places with one ally within 60 feet.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.DFz58LaC3lbLHio3]{Precise Flanker (Ex) (4th)}</h2>\n<p>You and allies who flank a foe with you gain an extra +1 bonus (+3 total) to your melee attack rolls against that target. If the flanked creature takes a guarded step, it provokes attacks of opportunity from you and allies who flank it with you.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.GwuMdqwszMGDWiEi]{Share Training (Ex) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>Select three combat feats you have. When you start your turn adjacent to an ally, as a reaction, you can select one of these feats and grant the ally its benefit for 1 round. To benefit from the selected feat, the ally must still meet its prerequisites.</p>"
