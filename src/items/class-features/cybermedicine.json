If that creature would benefit from any effect that restores Hit Points, increase the number of Hit Points restored by 50% or by an amount equal to your key ability score modifier, whichever is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor</strong>: You deliver a nanite solution to a living creature or construct, interfering with its healing or repair. Whenever the creature would regain Hit Points from an effect, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or regain no Hit Points from the effect. For persistent healing effects like regeneration, the creature must attempt a new saving throw against the inhibitor each round to regain Hit Points, though the inhibitor doesn’t suppress such abilities altogether. This is a poison effect and ignores a construct’s immunity to poison.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough</h2>\n<p>You can use the following ability when you achieve the breakthrough for this field of study.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Ee0Ig4jGuEW5f9Hi]{Override Biology (Na)}: As a standard action, you create and deliver a formula packed with nanites that flood a living creature’s body, granting it construct-like traits. The target gains the no breath universal creature ability as well as a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep (unless those effects specifically target constructs).</p>"
