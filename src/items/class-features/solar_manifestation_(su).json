The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>Manifestations</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.zM7oc1qiNLAPoH1J]{Solar Armor}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.kCvI3xvm0Q1slajx]{Solar Flare} *</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ylRInRfOfx6nsbUv]{Solar Shield} *</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.WWHUAfgpvk6uIgY0]{Solar Weapon} *</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0GKYyi6lUKAdcPk7]{Lunar Weapon} *</p>\n<p><em>Manifestations marked with * are Inventory items.</em></p>"
