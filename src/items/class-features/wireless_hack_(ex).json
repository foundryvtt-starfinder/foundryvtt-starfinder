This counts as a standard action for the purpose of the Computers skill. You must remain within 20 feet of the computer system for the entire time your exocortex is interacting with the computer. If the task requires multiple actions (or even rounds) to accomplish, you can spend your actions to work in concert with your exocortex, counting both your action and the exocortex&rsquo;s effective standard action toward the total time required. If you don&rsquo;t have the remote hack class feature, you must be adjacent to the computer to attempt your checks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
