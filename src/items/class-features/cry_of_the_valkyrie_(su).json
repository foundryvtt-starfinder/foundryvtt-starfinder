As a full action, you bring a creature that died recently back to life. If the creature has no Resolve Points, it regains 1 Resolve Point. Roll your expertise die and add your Charisma modifier to the result; the creature regains Hit Points and Stamina Points equal to the result. Finally, the creature gains a temporary negative level. This improvisation has a range of 30 feet, and you must spend a number of Resolve Points equal to 1 + the number of rounds that the creature has been dead, treating any fraction of a round as a round for this purpose. This improvisation can’t resuscitate creatures slain by death effects, creatures turned into undead, or creatures whose bodies were destroyed, significantly mutilated, disintegrated, and so on. For the purpose of determining whether a dead creature could be affected due to this improvisation’s mind-affecting and sense-dependent descriptors, treat the creature as though it were not dead.</p>\n<p>You can’t use this again until you spend a Resolve Point during a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.</p>"
