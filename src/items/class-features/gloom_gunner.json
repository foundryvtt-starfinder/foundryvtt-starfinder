By choosing this style, you create this link and use it to infuse your weapon attacks with the dark dimension’s uncanny magic. As your martial skill increases, so does your bond to the Shadow Plane. This stronger union with shadow allows you to become a frightening combatant with any armaments you wield.</p>\n<p>A couple of these features add bonus fusions to a weapon you wield. No weapon can gain a fusion it already has. However, these bonus fusions don’t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.OtJ2XMwgvOGQORBq]{Gloom Weapons (Su)} - 1st Level</h2><p>Due to your connection with the Shadow Plane, any weapon you wield is infused with planar power. Your melee and ranged attacks count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction and other situations, such as attacking @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#incorporeal]{incorporeal} creatures.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.AZf9i00aV6ZUTM9K]{Shadow Fusion (Su)} - 5th Level</h2><p>Weapons are considered to have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Item.nsQhsNOgfUYvLQIc]{ominous} fusion while you wield them. A creature that gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{shaken} condition from your bonus ominous fusion can gain that condition again from the same weapon, even if 24 hours haven’t passed.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.lUPTswMvpvwCO2UN]{Ominous Power (Su)} - 9th Level</h2><p>If you score a critical hit with a weapon you wield, you can apply the critical hit effect of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Item.nsQhsNOgfUYvLQIc]{ominous} fusion in addition to one other critical hit effect the weapon has. When you render a target @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{shaken}, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to change that condition to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.DtwiUWi8dpzkq4tM]{frightened} for the same duration. In addition, once per day when you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can reroll that saving throw.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DOa4LZ0bafSlcaP9]{Shadow Secrets (Su)} - 13th Level</h2><p>Weapons are considered to have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Item.j5zkM0udl7baRuG1]{ghost killer} fusion while you wield them (this is in addition to the ominous fusion granted by your shadow fusion ability). In addition, you can use your connection to the Shadow Plane to add one of the following benefits to a weapon you wield. These benefits cause bizarre visual distortions when you use them because they’re made possible by your manipulation of the spatial incongruities between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane. A chosen benefit lasts until the end of your turn.</p>\n<p>As part of the action you use to attack, increase your reach with the weapon by 5 feet.</p>\n<p>As part of the action you use to attack, double the weapon’s range increment.</p>\n<p>When you hit a creature, you can use a swift action to perform a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.R33uiOMesYP0ISWl#dirty-trick]{dirty trick} combat maneuver against it.</p>\n<p>As part of the action you use to attack, damage from the weapon you are using ignores hardness equal to your soldier level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.LlDwGLG88ikgXrAb]{Shadow Attack (Su)} - 17th Level</h2><p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make an attack against a creature you are aware of, ignoring all @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Kjba2E3Ad5oMJ7hV.JournalEntryPage.1jkwbVTGQihSpCrL]{cover} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Kjba2E3Ad5oMJ7hV.JournalEntryPage.nyB6pt2dd6iVQGmS]{concealment} (including total). If the attack is a ranged attack, the target must be within your weapon’s first range increment. The attack affects only your selected target, even if it normally affects an area or multiple targets. You still have to roll to hit your target, and an attack that misses has no effect.</p>"
