Signaled characters can also charge the opponent as a reaction if the distance between the character and the charged opponent is equal to or less than the signaled character’s speed. All characters that charge an opponent using this improvisation are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered} until the end of their next turn. Characters who can’t be staggered can’t benefit from this improvisation. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.</p>"
