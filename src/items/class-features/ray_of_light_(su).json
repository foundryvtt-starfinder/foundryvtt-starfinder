Any barrier that would block, reflect, or scatter light prevents you from moving through it. No creature can use a reaction to interfere with your movement or make attacks of opportunity against you unless it’s capable of reacting faster than the speed of light. At 17th level, you can touch one willing or unconscious creature to convert it to light and bring it with you as part of the same action.</span></p>",
