Instead of rolling to determine what type of creature the target returns as, the target returns as the race, gender, sex, and physical appearance of their choice. Rather than be a conscious choice of the target, this decision tends to reflect the innermost dreams and desires of the targetâ€™s soul, and so the reincarnation can be either identical to their previous form or a drastic departure, depending upon the individual.</p>\n<p>Unlike the spell <em>reincarnate</em>, this ability does not require a monument as part of the casting. Instead, both you and your target gain 2 permanent negative levels (as described by the spell). The target returns to life as an infant of their race, growing from infancy to young adulthood over the course of 1 hour. The target has memories of their original life, but also of a new life that could have existed if they had lived in their new form. In addition to having a new race, the character can be rewritten as if they had used a <em>mnemonic editor</em>.</p>"
