You take half the damage, and your ally takes the other half. This has no effect on spells, and any conditions delivered by the attack apply to both of you.

As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to suppress one of the following conditions for 10 minutes: exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, shaken, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered} (see pages 276–277). After 10 minutes, if the condition’s duration hasn’t ended, the condition’s effects return. You can suppress only one condition at a time; if you are both fatigued and shaken, you can avoid the effects of only one of them, and if you are affected by two different instances of the same condition, you’re still affected by the second one.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"bCvtws4aTTuKgfwm\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Kinetic Resistance (Ex) (4th)</a></h2>\n        <p>You gain DR 3/—.

Until the start of your next turn, you gain three benefits: your damage reduction increases to DR 10/—; you and the chosen ally each gain a +4 bonus to AC; and if you use guard’s protection, you direct all the damage to yourself such that your ally takes none.</p>",
