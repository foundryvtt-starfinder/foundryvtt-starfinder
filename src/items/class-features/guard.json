As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to suppress one of the following conditions for 10 minutes: exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or staggered (see pages 276–277). After 10 minutes, if the condition’s duration hasn’t ended, the condition’s effects return. You can suppress only one condition at a time; if you are both fatigued and shaken, you can avoid the effects of only one of them, and if you are affected by two different instances of the same condition, you’re still affected by the second one.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"bCvtws4aTTuKgfwm\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Kinetic Resistance (Ex) (4th)</a></h2>\n        <p>You gain DR 3/—.
