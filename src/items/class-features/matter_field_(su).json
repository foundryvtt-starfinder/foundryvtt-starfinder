This field grants you temporary Hit Points and fortification as if it were a force field with an item level equal to or lower than your mystic level. This field doesn’t block gases, liquids, or light. If the field drops to 0 temporary Hit Points, it ends. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 × your mystic level, but these rounds need not be consecutive. In general, it can be assumed you have enough air or loose matter around you to use this ability, but in some circumstances, such as when you are surrounded by vacuum, the GM is free to rule that this ability can function only if you can provide a source of matter.</p>"
