The raging inferno has always been with you, whether you&rsquo;ve come to find peace and solace by staring into a flickering flame, brought fire to those in need of heat, or immolated your foes with unrestrained flames. By focusing your bond with fire, you can cause flames to do your bidding, and at more powerful stages of your advancement, you can even breach the veil to contact or even pass into the Plane of Fire itself, stepping through a portal wreathed in flickering flames.<br /><br /><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2XYf2UNj7QtVgrms]{Angradd}, Feronia, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.VJ0UTIsAggcCQJBu]{Sarenrae}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.JpQpQbdXNOX6aTVG]{The Devourer}, Ymeri<br /><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.6by4xbwlnTJWmiOG]{Acrobatics} and @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.fbvbODKQ4RxdR1ry]{Intimidate}<br /><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.a2zXJ84rzkD8SIBe]{Overheat}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.7CuJLZTI7urZTQjE]{Emberstep}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.736kBaSS8R3XED1M]{Burning Ash Cloud}, 4th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.hnnmUzbxZ8Zxawaf]{Wall Of Fire}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.0c25gVm7RKKg1nIy]{Contact Other Plane}, 6th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.yjClpQv6CCrRE4EC]{Plane Shift}<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Fire Manipulation (Su) - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>You can control minor flames within 30 feet. As a standard action, you can smother a flame afflicting a single piece of equipment held or worn by anyone within range. Alternatively, you can transfer the burning condition from one creature to another within range by succeeding at a caster level check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 &times; the level or CR of the target creature). The target creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its Reflex saving throw to end the burning condition applied in this way.</p>\n<h2>Flickering Charge (Su) - 3rd Level</h2>\n<p>When you perform a charge, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to take on a fiery aspect as you move, increasing your speed by 10 feet until the end of your turn. At 8th level, when you use this ability, you also gain concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks made against you during the charge and until the beginning of your next turn. At 13th level, this miss chance increases to 40% and lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Embodiment of Flame (Su) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain fire resistance 10. At 16th level, this increases to fire resistance 20, and you no longer take fire damage from fire-dominant planes. At 20th level, this increases to fire resistance 30.</p>\n<h2>Flaming Weaponry (Su) - 9th Level</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can grant any weapon you hold the&nbsp;<em>flaming</em>&nbsp;weapon fusion regardless of its item level; this bonus fusion doesn&rsquo;t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. This bonus fusion lasts for as long as you wield the weapon and are conscious or until you spend another move action to suspend the effect.</p>\n<h2>Dancing Flame (Su) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>Whenever you succeed at a Reflex save, you can take a guarded step as a reaction. Alternatively, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to move up to half your speed as a reaction; you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by this movement.</p>\n<h2>Shared Flaming Weaponry (Su) - 15th Level</h2>\n<p>When you use the <em>flaming</em> weaponry connection power, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant the&nbsp;<em>flaming</em>&nbsp;weapon fusion to all allies&rsquo; wielded weapons within 60 feet of you; these bonus fusions don&rsquo;t count toward the maximum total level of fusions each weapon can have at once. These bonus fusions last for as long as your weapon has its bonus fusion.</p>\n<h2>Hungering Conflagration (Sp) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>Three times per day, you can cast a modified version of&nbsp;<em>chain surge</em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability. Your caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level and the DC is equal to 16 + your Wisdom modifier. This version of the spell replaces the electricity descriptor with the fire descriptor and deals fire damage instead of electricity damage. Targets failing the ensuing Reflex save gain the burning condition for 5d6 fire damage instead of the short out effect.</p>"
