As a standard action, you can focus ultraviolet light on a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature takes a –1 penalty to all saving throws for 1 round, or until you leave photon mode. If you are attuned or fully attuned, all creatures within 10 feet of the target take a –1 penalty to all saving throws for as long as the target is affected by this stellar revelation. If you would become unattuned from using a zenith revelation, the penalty remains until after the zenith revelation is resolved.</p>"
