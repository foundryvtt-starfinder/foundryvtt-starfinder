This might be the result of your own engineering abilities or a powerful patron giving you gear not available to the general public. You can add one more upgrade to your armor than its normal maximum number of upgrade slots. If you add this bonus upgrade to heavy armor, you can select an upgrade normally limited to powered armor. An upgrade placed in this bonus slot costs half the normal credit amount and sells for 10% of the reduced cost. If you move an upgrade from this bonus slot to another slot, you must pay the difference between the upgrade’s reduced cost and its normal cost.</p>"
