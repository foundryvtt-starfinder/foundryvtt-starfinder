You can take 1 minute and spend 1 Resolve Point to alter the type (between injury, ingested, or inhaled) of up to one dose of poison per your operative’s edge bonus. At 12th level, you gain the ability to alter the effects of your poison in addition to its delivery method. When you spend 1 minute altering your poison, you can spend 1 RP to change the poison’s track from one ability score to another. Any alterations are unstable and last only 24 hours. You can spend one minute to revert any number of doses of altered poisons from one type to another, returning them to their original containers even if they were consumable (ingested) or already applied to a weapon (injury).</p>"
