When injected, the formula allows the target to ignore the effects of the highest stage (not including the disease’s end state) of a single disease affecting them for 1 hour. The disease doesn’t progress normally during that time, but this time doesn’t count toward the disease’s duration. If you are at least 7th level, the target ignores the effects of the highest stage of a single disease for 24 hours. If you are at least 13th level, the target ignores the effects for 1 week.</p>"
