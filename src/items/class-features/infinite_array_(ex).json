Using&nbsp;this ability on yourself takes no action. At the beginning&nbsp;of your next turn, your body and equipment disperse into&nbsp;a nanite mist, fly up to 30 feet, and reform, in the process&nbsp;restoring you to life. You reappear upright and wielding any&nbsp;combination of equipment in your possession, and you regain&nbsp;1 Hit Point, all your Stamina Points, and 1 Resolve Point. You&nbsp;can then act on your turn as normal.</p>\n<p>As a reaction, you can instead use a nanite surge to use this ability on an adjacent ally when they die under the same conditions. If you use a nanite surge when you use this ability, you can instead target an ally up to 20 feet away. You can use additional nanite surges to increase this range by 20 feet for each nanite surge used. The ally disperses, flies, and reforms at the beginning of their next turn.</p>"
