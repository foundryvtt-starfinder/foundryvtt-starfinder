Others shun the shadows, afraid of what lurks in them, but you are that lurker. Knowledge can be found or hidden within the shadows, and you’re adaptable enough to use either option to suit your needs. Whether you hide your secrets or strike from safety, your bond with shadows grants you the supernatural ability to bend them to your will.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.kN8pC8Yfi8OuCvig]{Eloritu}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.S7A3XE5trtBc0SH8]{Lao Shu Po}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.NCjMqGMqprKIe33d]{Zon-Kuthon}</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i]{Intimidate}&nbsp;and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.5h3iePfJaeQMc3Qr]{Stealth}</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.AInneaaTOM6vd3a7]{Gloom Mote}, 2nd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.P9aD4oydmGXNXe43]{Paranoia}, 3rd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.G5BCE1kbpOj1mwiq]{Umbral Tendrils}, 4th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.bqYL9jEBAU7eqBjf]{Shadow Jump}, 5th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.oEpjvl1MgqsX9Yiv]{Shadow Body}, 6th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.o78PjAYBWQpiHwMK]{Shadow Walk}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PLvT6bMrwHUHyQbj]{Shadow Infusion (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. In addition, if the concealment that allows you to attempt a Stealth check to hide comes from dim light or darkness, you can double the bonus you receive from your channel skill mystic feature. Finally, add Stealth to your list of class skills.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0Tcb1gsTbmwz22vk]{Shadow Shroud (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to shroud yourself in dim light for 1 minute. Darkvision provides no benefit against this gloom, and nonmagical light can’t change this light level. Magical light can change this light level only if from a source with a CR or level higher than yours. You can dismiss this dim light as a move action, and it ends automatically if you lose consciousness.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.F5zWiQFS0gq7HXKB]{Shadow Weaver (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you have concealment from dim light or darkness, you can become invisible as a standard action. This invisibility lasts for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level. This duration needn’t be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can dismiss this invisibility as a move action, and it ends automatically if you lose consciousness.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PZXoEgY1MWpGUe6Q]{Shadow Puppet (Sp) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>While you are invisible from shadow weaver or shrouded in shadow from shadow blend, you can cast&nbsp;holographic image&nbsp;(spell level 3rd or lower). You can do so twice per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast the spell again after expending those uses. Any hologram you create using the 3rd-level version can include intelligible speech, if you wish.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.WdeVUZs14gbNjFKg]{Shadow Blend (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>If you are hidden or invisible in dim light or darkness, other creatures cannot use blindsense, blindsight, or sense through to locate you. In addition, if you’re benefiting from this feature and make noise that could reveal you, including speaking, creatures become aware of your presence in the dim or dark area you’re in but not your specific location. If you attempt to bully or demoralize a creature while benefiting from this feature, you can double the bonus to Intimidate you receive from your channel skill mystic feature.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hkxpEqAVFzW3WIXF]{Shadow Decoy (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>When you take damage while in dim light or darkness, as a reaction you can spend 1 Resolve Point to conjure a shadowy clone while you fade into the shadows. If you do so, you take only half the damage, as the clone appears in your space. You must then move 5 feet, but you can move up to half your speed. You can attempt a Stealth check to remain hidden after you move, and the shadowy clone disappears. Reduce your movement on your next turn by the amount you moved when you used this ability.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ECORIxEqCesONNUY]{Shadow Onslaught (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a swirling cloud of monstrous shades within a 60-foot-radius spread centered on you. The cloud lasts up to 1 round per mystic level you have. If you create this cloud on the Material Plane, you and creatures in the spell’s area slip into an identical battlefield on the Shadow Plane. You and other creatures in the effect can’t leave the area while it lasts. Each round, the shadows deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 cold damage to creatures hostile to you in the area. A target can attempt a Fortitude save to halve this damage. In addition, each time a creature takes damage, it can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve the shadowy illusion and take only half damage from it for the remainder of the effects duration. A creature that succeeds at both saves takes only one-quarter the effects damage that round. You can dismiss the effect as a move action. When the effect ends, any creatures it transported to the Shadow Plane return to the Material Plane.</p>"
