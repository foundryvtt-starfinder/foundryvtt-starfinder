This connection allows creatures with hivemind tendencies to share that strong mental connection with other creatures without overpowering either creature&rsquo;s individuality or free will. Benevolent mystics or those devoted to gods of tradition usually practice this connection, but darker mystics sometimes adopt this connection to guide others into servitude and corruption.<br /><br /><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.uBNlQguFvGTFLHSA]{Hylax}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.S7A3XE5trtBc0SH8]{Lao Shu Po}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.V3pXOlk6kMulWA01]{Talavet}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.NCjMqGMqprKIe33d]{Zon-Kuthon}<br /><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.QGSqQDA9P7oYQp8z]{Diplomacy} and @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.CzEAY60hUMyfOC4G]{Perception}<br /><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.Q9W1JWVHI9iq2R6y]{Share Language}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.Mn5F4th3ctW5oKJ4]{Status}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.SysRFlYml1f1Eofd]{Charm Monster}, 4th -@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.usqy3VusjjgEnM9N]{Restoration}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.J14mFZezYHIGHVhO]{Dominate Person}, 6th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.ekj93MeLRazilGH5]{Telepathic Jaunt}<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.jUxmsvjT1gtk2dix]{Steady Psyche (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You can draw some of another creature&rsquo;s mental dissonance into your mind to help steady their psyche. As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you attempts a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can also attempt the saving throw. If you succeed, you grant that creature a +2 divine bonus to the saving throw. You can use this ability again only after 1 minute has passed, unless you spend 1 Resolve Point to use it sooner.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.FllfnokkwHHgZNh3]{Share Skills (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can impart knowledge on a telepathic level. If the GM rules you can do so, when a creature within 60 feet of you attempts a skill check, you can attempt to aid another. You and the aided creature must take the required actions or spend the required time to complete the check. For example, if you aid a creature in disabling a tricky device, the aided creature takes 1d4 rounds to do so, and you take the same amount of time.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.EewNvBCcUejj4gHJ]{Hive Link (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day as a standard action, you can forge a psychic link with another creature that you can perceive within 60 feet of you. An unwilling creature can resist this link with a successful Will save. Once the link has been established, the distance between you and the target has no effect on the link, provided the target remains on the same plane of existence. While the target is on a plane other than the one you are on, the link ceases to function, but it resumes when you return to the same plane unless you have ended it in the meantime. While the link functions, you and the linked creature can communicate telepathically with each other. This link lasts until you end it with a free action or for 24 hours. You can have only one linked creature at a time.</p><p>When you use steady psyche, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow your linked creature to use the result of your saving throw d20 roll, adding the linked creature&rsquo;s bonus to the result instead of yours. Alternatively, when you use share skills with a linked creature, instead of aiding another you can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow your ally to use your skill modifier for the check. These effects are in addition to the benefits granted by the original abilities.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.mTp8uAjtT0gEQfqW]{Expanded Hive Link (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your hive link three times per day, and you can have a psychic link with up to three other creatures at one time. In addition, as a standard action, you and one linked creature can share some or all your senses, allowing you to perceive the area around the linked creature and for that creature to perceive the area around you. If you share your senses with the linked creature, it is staggered while you do so. You can share your senses for a number of rounds per day equal to twice your mystic level, requiring a standard action each round you do so. These rounds need not be consecutive. The effect ends when you don&rsquo;t take the required standard action to maintain it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Gs4jOFtkZB8lR85x]{Share Spells (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>A linked creature can deliver touch spells for you or become the target of spells that normally have a range of personal. If you and your chosen linked creature are within 60 feet of each other at the time you cast such a spell, you can designate that creature as either the conduit or the target. A conduit can deliver a touch spell as if it were you. Because you power the spell, if you cast another spell before the touch is delivered, the spell imbued in your linked creature ends. If you designate a linked creature as the target of a spell that normally has a range of personal, the linked creature is affected as if it were you, and you are unaffected.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.uWE9zJRmXpoBeLuU]{Hive Bond (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can use your telepathic bond class feature to include unwilling targets. Unwilling targets can negate the effect with a successful Will saving throw. In addition, you can treat any creature linked to you by your telepathic bond class feature as a creature linked to you by hive link when using other features of this connection. You can be linked to no more than three unwilling targets, but otherwise only the targeting parameter of telepathic bond limits your number of willing targets. In addition, unwilling targets receive a new saving throw against your telepathic bond after every 24 hours as a part of that bond. If any unwilling target frees itself from the bond, the telepathic bond ends for all targets.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wh1YSFIagy6w24d5]{Hive Strength (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You are in constant telepathic communication with all creatures linked to and within 60 feet of you. If one of you is aware of something, all of you are.<br />When any linked creature wants to spend Resolve Points but doesn&rsquo;t have enough to spend on the desired effect, another linked creature can spend 1 Resolve Point. A creature that does so can then spend its remaining Resolve Points on behalf of the linked creature in need of extra Resolve Points. Once a linked creature spends or receives Resolve Points from this ability, it can&rsquo;t use or benefit from this ability again until after it rests for 8 hours to regain Resolve Points.</p><p>In addition, creatures linked to you through your hive link connection powers and through your telepathic bond class feature are viable targets for any&nbsp;<em>telepathic jaunt</em>&nbsp;spell you cast.</p>"
