Attempt a Bluff check; the DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent&rsquo;s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the opponent&rsquo;s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, the target&rsquo;s attention is locked on you, giving it a &ndash;2 penalty to Perception checks other than those made against you as well as a &ndash;2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn&rsquo;t include you as a target. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until the target can no longer perceive you with a precise sense. As a move action, you can extend the effect&rsquo;s duration until the end of your following turn.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to affect multiple creatures, up to a maximum of half your envoy level. Attempt one check against all of the targets. The DC of the check is equal to the DC to use spectacle against the creature with the highest CR of those you&rsquo;re attempting to affect, plus 1 for each target beyond the first. When you extend the effect, the duration increases for all targets. However, the effect ends for a target (though not necessarily for other targets) once that target can no longer perceive you with a precise sense.</p>"
