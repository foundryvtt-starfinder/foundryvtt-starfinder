Whenever you gain these or any other paradoxes, roll 1d20 for each and record the result associated with that paradox. You can never reroll paradoxes.</p>\n<p>Many precog abilities allow you to use a paradox in place of a specific d20 roll you would make, using the paradox’s associated result instead of rolling a random result. The paradox functions in every way like a normally rolled die; a paradox of 1 functions as a natural 1, and a paradox of 20 functions as a natural 20. You can’t use a paradox for a die that has already been rolled or rerolled, and you can’t reroll a paradox. Some precog abilities simply require you to use a paradox without using its associated result. Regardless of how you use a paradox, it is lost and can’t be used again.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can use a paradox in place of your d20 roll for an ability score check or caster level check. In addition, you can use a paradox on a d20 roll associated with your anchor’s focal paradox; once per day when you do, you immediately gain a new paradox.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are trained).</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your attack rolls, Fortitude and Will saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are untrained).</p>"
