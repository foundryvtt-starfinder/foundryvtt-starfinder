In addition, the range of your exocortex’s wireless hack increases to 40 feet. Your exocortex can also engage in combat tracking and hack a nearby computer at the same time, but the computer counts as one of the exocortex’s designated targets (allowing you to track only two targets at the same time while wirelessly hacking the computer). Lastly, you can access your exocortex’s memory module in combat, even while it is engaged in combat tracking.</p>"
