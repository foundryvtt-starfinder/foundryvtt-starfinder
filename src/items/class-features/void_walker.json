If you succeed, you learn the lowest saving throw modifier of the target and how much hardness it possesses, if any.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.U1wBSyQCyORAPSbA]{Destructive Touch (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2><p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve point to attempt a sunder combat maneuver against an item in use by an opponent within 30 feet. If successful, you deal damage to the item equal to 3d6 + your level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.WAUrD4D9FpwVfXuI]{Negative Energy Adaptation (Su) - 6th Level}</h2><p>You gain cold resistance 10. At 16th level, this increases to cold resistance 20, and you no longer take bludgeoning damage in the vacuum of space. At 20th level, this increases to cold resistance 30.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.je5UgfOcHex78wu9]{Lacerating Weaponry (Su) - 9th Level}</h2><p>As a move action, you can grant any weapon you hold the benefits of the bleeding weapon fusion regardless of its item level; this bonus fusion doesn’t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. This bonus fusion lasts as long as you wield the weapon and are conscious, or until you spend another move action to suspend the effect.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.bZTgY2Rop1ARXama]{Ward Off the End (Su) - 12th Level}</h2><p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature a +2 insight bonus to saves against spells from the necromancy school for 1 minute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.BwxMYHlWizlSN0TD]{Shared Lacerating Weaponry (Su) - 15th Level}</h2><p>When you use your lacerating weaponry connection power, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to extend the effect to the wielded weapons of all allies within 60 feet of you, granting them the benefits of the bleeding weapon fusion. When the effect of lacerating weaponry ends on your weapon, it also ends on all the weapons you affected with this power.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.xyGd5kPsMRC7UoIV]{Decrepitude (Su) - 18th Level}</h2><p>Once per day as a standard action, you can rapidly and temporarily advance the age of a target creature within 60 feet. Organic creatures become withered and decrepit, while constructs rust and break down. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a –3 penalty to Armor Class, attack rolls, and Fortitude and Reflex saving throws. The effect lasts 3 rounds, after which the target reverts to its original age.</p>"
