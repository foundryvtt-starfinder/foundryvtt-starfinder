Though others may not believe you, you are certain in your very core that one critical moment altered whatever fate had in store for you. Since that divergence, you&rsquo;ve gained a wider appreciation of time&rsquo;s passage and a sense of what could have been, and you&rsquo;re able to influence the timeline more than others could ever hope to. Still, you remain sure that your timeline is wrong, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone or something comes to correct that error.</p>\n<p><strong>Focal Paradox:</strong> Two trained skill checks (chosen at 1st level).</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Si1Z9DM4nTPdeaGR]{Improved Anchor}:</strong> Once per day, at the start of your turn when you are dying, you can use a paradox to immediately stabilize. When you do so, you regain 1 Hit Point as though you spent 1 RP to stay in the fight (Starfinder Core Rulebook 251).</p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.B1ufWGNoiGY67c24]{Greater Anchor}:</strong> Once per day, when you take the full attack action and make both attacks against a single target, if one of your attacks is a hit and the other is a miss, you can instead hit (though not score a critical hit) with the attack that would have missed. Alternatively, if both attacks hit, you can make an additional attack with the same weapon against the same target at a &ndash;6 penalty.</p>"
