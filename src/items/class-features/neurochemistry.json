While the creature is ignoring these effects, the duration of the condition elapses as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor</strong>: You deliver a strong chemical admixture that interferes with a creature’s neurons (or equivalent), imparting a –2 penalty to Will saving throws.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough</h2>\n<p>You can use the following ability when you achieve the breakthrough for this field of study.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cIOaVgl7fpKFiBgM]{Boost Neurotransmitters (Ex)}: As a standard action, you can create and deliver a compound that causes a surge of cognitive activity. When injected into a creature, the formula grants the target a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind‑affecting effects for 1 minute. If the target is already subject to a mind-affecting effect, the target can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 enhancement bonus against the effect. This does not grant a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one.</p>"
