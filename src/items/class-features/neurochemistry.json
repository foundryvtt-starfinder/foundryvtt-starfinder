When injected into a creature, the formula grants the target a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind‑affecting effects for 1 minute. If the target is already subject to a mind-affecting effect, the target can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 enhancement bonus against the effect. This does not grant a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one.</p>"
