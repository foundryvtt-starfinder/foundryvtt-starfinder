If it already has spell resistance, increase the spell resistance by 1 (or by 2 if the original spell resistance is less than or equal to 10 + your biohacker level).</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor:</strong> Your inhibitor restricts the magical pathways of the target’s body, making spellcasting more difficult. Reduce the caster level and saving throw DCs of spells and spell-like abilities the creature casts by 1. The creature takes a penalty equal to 1 per damage die when rolling damage dealt by its spells and spell-like abilities.</p>\n<p>For the duration of the inhibitor’s effect, spells and spell-like abilities that normally have a casting time of 1 standard action instead gain a casting time of 1 round, and spells and spell-like abilities that normally have a casting time of 1 round gain a casting time of 2 rounds.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough</h2>\n<p>You can use the following ability when you achieve the breakthrough for this field of study.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.fij0r6kLevhk9qOj]{Magic Renewal (Su)}:</strong> As a standard action, you can create and deliver a medicinal formula to a living creature that restores one of that creature’s expended spell slots or expended spell-like abilities. The level of the spell slot or spell-like ability restored cannot exceed one-third your biohacker level (rounded up). A creature can benefit from your magic renewal breakthrough only once per day.</p>"
