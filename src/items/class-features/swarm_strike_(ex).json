You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls for this attack. Using a swarm strike requires you to have at least one hand free. For each attack, you can deal bludgeoning damage, piercing damage, slashing damage, or any two of these damage types. At 3rd level, you gain a unique weapon specialization with your swarm strike, adding 1-1/2 × your nanocyte level to its damage rolls (instead of just adding your character level). At 7th level, this unarmed strike gains the thrown (20 feet) special property, and while you have at least two hands free, your weapon specialization damage bonus with this weapon increases to 2 × your level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, while you have at least two hands free, your swarm strike gains the reach special property. At 15th level, the range increment of your thrown swarm strike increases to 40 feet, and it increases to 60 feet at 19th level. You can use this ability only while your sheath array is active.</p>"
