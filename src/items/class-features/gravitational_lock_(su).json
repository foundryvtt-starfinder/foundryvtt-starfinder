As a move action, choose one creature adjacent to you. Whenever the target attempts to move to any space that isn’t adjacent to you before the beginning of your next turn, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or be unable to move into that space, losing the remainder of the distance it could’ve traveled with that action. Once the target is no longer adjacent to you, the effect ends. While you’re attuned or fully attuned, a target that fails its save also struggles to focus on anyone but you, treating enemies other than you as having concealment. Once a creature has been affected by this revelation, it becomes immune to your gravitational lock for 24 hours.</p>"
