An unwilling creature can resist this link with a successful Will save. Once the link has been established, the distance between you and the target has no effect on the link, provided the target remains on the same plane of existence. While the target is on a plane other than the one you are on, the link ceases to function, but it resumes when you return to the same plane unless you have ended it in the meantime. While the link functions, you and the linked creature can communicate telepathically with each other. This link lasts until you end it with a free action or for 24 hours. You can have only one linked creature at a time.</p>When you use steady psyche, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow your linked creature to use the result of your saving throw d20 roll, adding the linked creatureâ€™s bonus to the result instead of yours. Alternatively, when you use share skills with a linked creature, instead of aiding another you can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow your ally to use your skill modifier for the check. These effects are in addition to the benefits granted by the original abilities."
