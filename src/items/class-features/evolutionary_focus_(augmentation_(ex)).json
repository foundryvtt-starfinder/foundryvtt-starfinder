In addition, you can install one additional augmentation into one of your systems that already has an augmentation, so long as at least one of those augmentations is of a type associated with your niche. You can have no more than two augmentations in that system, even if you have another ability that grants you a similar benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.EYx8VGCBeDcQ5VlU]{Ultimate (19th Level)}:</strong> The discount from your augmented form class feature increases to 40%.
