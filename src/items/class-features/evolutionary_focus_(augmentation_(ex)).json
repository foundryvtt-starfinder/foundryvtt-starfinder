The discount from your augmented form class feature increases to 20%.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.grM1W1vtzYyKLw9t]{Advanced (13th Level)}:</strong> The discount from your augmented form class feature increases to 30%. In addition, you can install one additional augmentation into one of your systems that already has an augmentation, so long as at least one of those augmentations is of a type associated with your niche. You can have no more than two augmentations in that system, even if you have another ability that grants you a similar benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.EYx8VGCBeDcQ5VlU]{Ultimate (19th Level)}:</strong> The discount from your augmented form class feature increases to 40%. Your advanced focus ability now lets you install an additional augmentation in two different systems that already have augmentations, though this still doesn’t let you have more than two augmentations in a system.</p>"
