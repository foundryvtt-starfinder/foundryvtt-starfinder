If the effect would not normally allow a saving throw, you can attempt a Will save to negate it. If you succeed at the save, you appear as if you were subject to the effect to other creatures, though you can act as you choose. This ability doesn’t prevent Sense Motive checks from succeeding against you or other creatures from harboring suspicions.</p>\n</div>"
