Any damage to the armor or its wearer is subtracted from these temporary Hit Points first. These temporary Hit Points last 1 minute or until reduced to 0. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again unless you expend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.<br>Additionally, when acting in the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single quadrant of your starship. You bolster that section of the ship’s armor or defensive countermeasures, increasing the ship’s Armor Class or Target Lock (respectively) in that quadrant by 2 for a number of rounds equal to your mechanic level; alternatively, you can restore a number of Shield Points in that quadrant equal to your mechanic level.</span></p>",
