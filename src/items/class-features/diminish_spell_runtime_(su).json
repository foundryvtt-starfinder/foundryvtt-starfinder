You must be able to touch the area, creature, or object affected by the spell that you want to hack. As part of the hack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × the caster level of the spell. If you succeed, you reduce the spell’s duration by 50%. If this reduces its duration to less time than the effect has already been active, the spell ends as if dispelled. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you can’t attempt to hack that spell again for 24 hours. This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration.</p>"
