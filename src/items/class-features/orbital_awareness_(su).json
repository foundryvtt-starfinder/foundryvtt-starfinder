As a full action, choose a 5-foot square that is within 30 feet and to which you have line of sight. For up to 10 minutes while you are within 30 feet of that square, you can perceive as though you were in the selected space. The effect ends prematurely after a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier in which you are neither using sidereal influence with photon skills nor have at least 1 attunement point in photon mode.</p>\n<p>While you are outside, the effect’s range increases to 300 feet so long as you and the selected square both have a clear view of the sky or space. Under these circumstances, you can’t be flanked while this ability is active, and you can perceive from the selected square as though you had darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</p>"
