This grants you a bonus to attack and damage rolls with basic melee weapons and small arms. The bonus to attacks is equal the level of spell slot expended – 2 (minimum +1 bonus), and the bonus to damage is equal to the level of the spell slot expended. This frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) plus the level of the spell slot expended. You can dismiss your destructive frenzy early as a free action. While your destructive frenzy is active, you can’t cast spells or use any other extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural ability that requires you to spend an action.",
