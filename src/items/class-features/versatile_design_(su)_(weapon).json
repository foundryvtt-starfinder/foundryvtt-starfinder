Select four weapon fusions of a level your prototype weapon qualifies for. Your weapon gains one of these fusions without it counting against the total item levels of fusions it can have. With 10 minutes of work, you can change the weapon fusion currently installed in your weapon prototype to another of your selected fusions. If a fusion selected with this ability has a limited number of uses, using it counts against the uses of any other fusion you access with this ability. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can change the four fusions you have selected.&nbsp;</span></p>",
