At 1st level, pick a school of magic and gain the listed effect. Unless otherwise noted, you can use each effect twice per day as a reaction when you, an ally, or an enemy within 60 feet casts a spell in that school, applying the effect to that triggering spell. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, you can invest in your technomantic talents, either increasing the effect of a school you’ve already chosen or choosing a new school.</p>\n<p><strong>Abjuration:</strong> You increase (or decrease) either the duration or caster level check of an abjuration spell as though the caster level of its caster were 2 levels higher (or lower). Each subsequent time you choose this as a technomantic talent, you can increase (or decrease) either duration as though its caster level were an additional 2 higher (or lower). This effect can’t cause a spell’s duration to last longer than 24 hours or be reduced to less than 1 round.</p>"
