You can create an explosive mine with light bulk without paying for it; this process takes 10 minutes and can be performed when you spend a Resolve Point to rest and regain Stamina Points. You can have only one mine created by this ability at a time. As a full action that requires a free hand, you can draw, arm, and deploy the mine in a 5-foot square within 30 feet, after which the mine conceals itself with an active camouflage field. Only you can use your mines effectively.</p>\n<p>Any creatures observing you when you deploy the mine automatically notices the mine’s location; other creatures must attempt a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check (DC 10 + your soldier level + your key ability score modifier) the first time they’re within 30 feet of the mine to spot it; this doesn’t require an action. A creature can disable a mine it spotted with a successful @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.76u4HnGcAlySicb4]{Engineering} check (DC 10 + your soldier level + your key ability score modifier) as though it were a trap, and the mine deactivates harmlessly if destroyed (hardness 10, with Hit Points equal to 3 × your soldier level). A mine remains armed for 1 hour or until you create a new mine.</p>\n<p>The next time a creature enters the square, the mine explodes, dealing 1d4 fire and piercing damage to any creaturein that square and imposing a –5-foot penalty to its speed for 1d4 rounds. A mine doesn’t explode if a creature begins its turn in the same square, but it does explode if the creature leaves and reenters the square. The damage increases to 1d8 at your 3rd soldier level, 2d8 at 7th level, 3d8 at 11th level, 5d8 at 15th level, and 8d8 at 19th level. The speed penalty increases to –10 feet at 11th level, but it can’t reduce a creature’s speeds below half their normal values.</p>"
