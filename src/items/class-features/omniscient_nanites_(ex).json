The range of your blindsight (vibration) granted by the all-seeing nanites knack increases to 20 feet. This blindsight also extends to any area to which your nanite cloud has line of effect, to a range of 20 feet. Traces of your nanite host can even penetrate solid material, granting you the sense through (blindsight [vibration]) ability, which is blocked by especially dense or thick materials as normal. Finally, when you apply a nanite tracker to a target using the all-seeing nanites knack, you can sense the target as though you had blindsight (vibration) with a range of a number of miles equal to your Constitution modifier. You must have the all-seeing nanites knack to select this knack.</p>"
