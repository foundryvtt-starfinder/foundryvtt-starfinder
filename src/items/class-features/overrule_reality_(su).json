When you succeed at a Bluff check to deceive a creature, that creature continues to believe the deception even if presented with direct evidence to the contrary (believing that its senses are deceiving it, other creatures are lying, and so on). In addition, your Bluff checks don’t automatically fail if such evidence is present, though the creature or creatures you’re attempting to deceive can attempt a Will save to disbelieve your deception. This effect lasts for 24 hours, after which time the creature responds normally to proof of deception.</p>\n</div>"
