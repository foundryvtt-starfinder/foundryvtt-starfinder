When a foe is flanking you and misses you with a melee attack, you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver against that foe as a reaction. If your combat maneuver succeeds, you switch places with that foe, and the foe rerolls the attack against the ally who was allowing them to flank you. This attack roll is made at the same bonus as the original attack and gains the benefits of flanking.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, you can use this improvisation even if the attack would hit you by spending 1 Resolve Point; if your combat maneuver succeeds, you take the minimum amount of damage, and the foe still rerolls the attack against their ally.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span>From AP #35 pg. 51</span></p>"
