A number of times per day equal to half your mystic level, you can teleport a nonliving, inanimate object that you are touching and that has up to 2 bulk up to 500 feet away. You do not need to be able to see the destination, but you must be able to clearly describe it, such as “500 feet north.” If the object would arrive in an occupied space, this ability fails but is still expended. Alternatively, you can teleport an object within 500 feet to yourself; you must be able to clearly identify both the object and its current location. You can choose to be holding the object when it arrives, if you are able to hold it; otherwise, the object arrives on the ground in your space.</p>"
