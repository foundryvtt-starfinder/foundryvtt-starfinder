The radius of any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a radius expands by 10 feet. Any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) that lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode now lasts for 1d4 rounds if you are not in photon mode. You also increase the power of any of the following photon revelations you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Astrologic Sense</strong>: You can see twice as far into the future as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Glow of Life</strong>: You can use this revelation as a swift action, rather than a move action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hypnotic Glow</strong>: The charm’s duration doubles.</p>\n<p><strong>Stellar Rush</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus to your EAC until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em>Expanded list from Galactic Magic.</em></p><em></em><p><em></em><strong>Awakened Flames*:</strong>&nbsp;When rolling damage for this revelation’s burning condition, you treat any damage die with a result of 1 as though it were a 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Back Blast:</strong>&nbsp;Creatures that fail their Reflex save against this revelation are also buffeted by the winds, becoming flatfooted until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Curving Flare:&nbsp;</strong> The second ranged attack made with this revelation is made at only a –6 penalty (or –4 if you’re attuned or fully attuned).</p>\n<p><strong>Distant Burst:&nbsp;</strong> The revelation’s range increases to 30 feet, or 60 feet when you’re attuned or fully attuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Forceful Shield:</strong>&nbsp;Once per minute as part of this revelation’s full action, you can take a guarded step toward the target of your solar shield attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Solar Inferno:</strong>&nbsp;Increase the damage dealt by this revelation’s burning condition by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Vital Reinforcement:</strong>&nbsp;The first time the affected ally regains Hit Points or Stamina Points before the end of your next turn after using this revelation, increase either the Hit Points or Stamina Points regained by half your solarian level.</p>\n<p><em>For automation of abilities, when able, please add bonus effects in the Modifiers tab of the associated Stellar Revelation.</em></p>"
