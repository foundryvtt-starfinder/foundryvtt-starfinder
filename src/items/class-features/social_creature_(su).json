You gain the benefits listed on the following page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you carouse, you can choose another character to carouse with you; that character can’t perform a downtime activity on the day you carouse with them. If you succeed at the Fortitude saving throw required for the carouse activity, both you and the character you’ve chosen gain the benefit; if you fail, only you suffer the penalty.</li>\n<li>When you perform the entertain downtime activity, you gain the normal benefits for the lounge activity even if you fail to properly entertain all creatures you attempted to entertain.</li>\n<li>When you explore futures, you can choose two creatures to gain the benefit of this downtime activity instead of only one.</li>\n<li>You can use the lounge downtime activity in any environment, and you don’t need a comfortable space.</li>\n<li>When you select a downtime activity, you can also perform the maintain readiness activity at the same time; however, when you do, you don’t gain any of the other benefits listed for this ability for other downtime activities. For example, if you maintain readiness and also perform the lounge activity, you need a comfortable space as described on page 153 of the Character Operations Manual.</li>\n<li>When you take the practice profession downtime activity, you always gain the +5 bonus to the check for using a profession based on the ability score listed for each area of focus, even if your profession is based on a different ability.</li>\n</ul>"
