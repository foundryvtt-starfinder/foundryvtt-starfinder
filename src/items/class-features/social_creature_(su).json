You gain the benefits listed on the following page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you carouse, you can choose another character to carouse with you; that character can&rsquo;t perform a downtime activity on the day you carouse with them. If you succeed at the Fortitude saving throw required for the carouse activity, both you and the character you&rsquo;ve chosen gain the benefit; if you fail, only you suffer the penalty.</li>\n<li>When you perform the entertain downtime activity, you gain the normal benefits for the lounge activity even if you fail to properly entertain all creatures you attempted to entertain.</li>\n<li>When you explore futures, you can choose two creatures to gain the benefit of this downtime activity instead of only one.</li>\n<li>You can use the lounge downtime activity in any environment, and you don&rsquo;t need a comfortable space.</li>\n<li>When you select a downtime activity, you can also perform the maintain readiness activity at the same time; however, when you do, you don&rsquo;t gain any of the other benefits listed for this ability for other downtime activities. For example, if you maintain readiness and also perform the lounge activity, you need a comfortable space as described on page 153 of the Character Operations Manual.</li>\n<li>When you take the practice profession downtime activity, you always gain the +5 bonus to the check for using a profession based on the ability score listed for each area of focus, even if your profession is based on a different ability.</li>\n</ul>"
