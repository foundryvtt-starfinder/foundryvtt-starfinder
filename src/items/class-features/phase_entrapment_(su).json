Once per combat as a standard action, you can make an attack with a technological weapon against a target’s EAC. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be phased into an extradimensional space for 1 round. The creature is not harmed in this space, but it effectively ceases to exist and it cannot be located or contacted by any mundane or magical means. When the duration expires, the creature reappears in the space it last occupied, or in the closest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. To the target creature, it seems as if no time has passed during its absence, and it returns exactly in the state it was when it disappeared, including having the same duration remaining on any spells or effects that were affecting it at the time of its departure. At 17th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you affect a creature with this ability to increase the effect’s duration to 1d4 rounds.</p>"
