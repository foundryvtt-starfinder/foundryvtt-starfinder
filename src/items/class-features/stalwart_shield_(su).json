As a move action while holding your solar shield, you can gain resistance 5 to cold and fire, which increases by another 5 at 20th level. This resistance lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode, whichever comes first. While attuned or fully attuned, if you use a move action to align your solar shield against a specific target, you increase this resistance by 5 against the abilities and attacks of that target. If you have any items that would specifically benefit solar armor, they apply their benefits to your solar shield while this revelation is active. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation.</span></p>",
