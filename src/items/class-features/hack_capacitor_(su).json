Select three magic hacks that you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these magic hacks for 1 minute. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use hack capacitor again before the duration expires, you replace the previous magic hack with the new choice. If a magic hack you chose with hack capacitor has a daily use limitation, any uses of any magic hack from your hack capacitor count toward the hackâ€™s daily limit. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one magic hack you selected with this ability with another choice.<br><br>At 12th level, select a fourth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of two magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 1 Resolve Point (or 2 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). Both magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability, so if you use this ability again during the same day, both magic hacks are replaced.<br><br>At 18th level, select a fifth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of three magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 2 Resolve Points (or 3 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). All three magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability. At 19th level, you can use this ability as a swift action or a move action.<br><br>This replaces cache capacitor and resolve attunement.</span></p>",
