      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.YMGOKoZtKgJqIsAD]{Mechanic Trick}</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you can use your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.uWZ3LvxQ3yezLB4j]{Custom Rig (Ex)} to modify a touched ranged small arm, longarm, or heavy weapon. You can increase its range increment by 20 feet (or double, whichever is less), but doing so reduces the weapon’s damage dice by 1 when wielded by anyone other than you (for example, a weapon that would normally deal 3d8 damage deals 2d8 damage instead; a weapon reduced to 0 dice does 1 damage) or reduce its save DC by 2 for weapons that don’t use damage dice. You can instead reduce the range increment of such a weapon with a range increment of at least 40 feet to one-quarter its normal range and either increase its damage by 1d6 of its usual type or increase its save DC by 1 (for weapons that do not use damage dice). The item must be unattended or held by a willing creature. This change lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you reverse the effect with a move action.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single non-capital weapon. You either extend or shorten the weapon’s range by one step; doing so reduces its damage dice by 1 (such as 4d4 to 3d4, with weapons reduced to 0 dice doing 1 damage) or increases its damage by 1d6, respectively. You can’t reduce a weapon’s range below short or extend it beyond long. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level or until you undo the recalibration as a push engineer action.</p>"
