During this time, you can strike your allies with your entropic strike without making an attack roll, and your entropic strike doesn’t deal damage to your allies but instead restores an equivalent number of Hit Points. An ally can’t regain Hit Points from your entropic strike more than once per hour.</p>\n<p><em>Improved</em>: You can make one attack with your entropic strike against an ally when you use your aspect catalyst.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.xTcuGxj9l2E4wcp6]{Rebound Finale (Su)} As a reaction when you regain stamina or hit points, you can spend 1 or more Entropy Points to replicate half of this effect on allies within 30 feet. You effect a number of allies equal to the number of Entropy Points you spend. Stamina and Hit Points regained from this ability can’t be further replicated or increased in any way.</p>"
