That ally regains a number of Stamina Points (up to his maximum) equal to twice your envoy level + your Charisma modifier; at 15th level, this increases to three times your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost, that ally canâ€™t gain the benefits of your inspiring boost again until he takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add your envoy level to the number of Stamina Points regained.</p>"
