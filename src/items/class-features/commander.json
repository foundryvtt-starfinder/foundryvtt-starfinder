You gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.C723haEqOPJO3JLF]{Coordinated Shot} as a bonus feat, and you can choose Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity as your key ability score if you choose the commander fighting style as your primary fighting style.</p>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, whenever you gain a gear boost, you can instead select an envoy @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.DR8JvF0xiwsXggxj]{expertise talent}. You count as having expertise with Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive for this purpose, and you can select only expertise talents that require expertise with one of these four skills. If an expertise talent would require you to forgo your expertise die, you must instead spend 1 Resolve Point to use that talent.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.qIlV1wdWhSC0RIHT]{Lead by Example (Ex)} - 5th Level</h2><p>As a move action, you can choose one opponent within 30 feet. If you hit that opponent with any attack before the end of your turn, your allies gain the attack bonus from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.C723haEqOPJO3JLF]{Coordinated Shot} against that opponent, and you don’t provide that opponent cover. These benefits last until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.qGX8VqAWTqrXw2UP]{Coordinated Defense (Ex)} - 9th Level</h2><p>Whenever an ally attempts an attack roll while flanking with you, or when an ally benefits from your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.C723haEqOPJO3JLF]{Coordinated Shot} feat, they also gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves and AC until the start of their next turn. If your ally’s attack hits, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves and AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>When you use lead by example and you hit with the attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant the attack bonus from Coordinated Shot to all allies attacking any enemy within 30 feet of you; when you do, you don’t provide cover to any enemies. Both these benefits last until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.qchsymKuj7nsGoCw]{Rallying Cry (Ex)} - 13th Level</h2><p>As a move action, you can choose one ally within 30 feet that’s affected by an emotion effect and attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the ally’s level). If you succeed, the effect ends. Once an ally has benefited from your rallying cry, that ally can’t gain the benefits of your rallying cry again until they take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you critically hit an opponent or reduce an opponent’s Hit Points to 0, you can take a reaction to grant the attack bonus from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.C723haEqOPJO3JLF]{Coordinated Shot} to all allies attacking any enemy within 30 feet of you; when you do, you don’t provide cover to any enemies. Both of these benefits last until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.xE1KF3hJ8lPbq6kK]{Legendary Example (Ex)} - 17th Level</h2><p>When you successfully attack an enemy, you automatically use lead by example; this doesn’t require an action.</p>"
