The maximum number of squares you can fill this way equals 1 plus your Constitution bonus, and at least one of those squares must be adjacent to you. The cloud is stationary once formed, though you can reconfigure its space as a move action; if you do so, at least one square of the cloud must remain unchanged. When you take a guarded step, you can move 10 feet as long as you begin and end this movement adjacent to or within your cloud array.</p>\n<p>When you form a cloud array, you can use a nanite surge to increase the cloud’s density. This causes the array’s space to provide concealment, but it provides only a 10% miss chance. It doesn’t provide enough concealment to hide, and your attacks ignore any miss chance provided by your cloud. This concealment doesn’t stack with existing concealment.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, whenever you form a cloud array, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 15%. At 7th level, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 20%. At 11th level, the cloud fills up to a number of contiguous&nbsp;&nbsp;squares equal to 1 plus twice your Constitution modifier. At 15th level, when you use a nanite surge while forming the cloud array, any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 25% (though your attacks still ignore any miss chance). At 19th level, the cloud instead fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus four times your Constitution modifier.</p>"
