At 1st level, after purchasing your starting equipment, designate one piece of equipment as your signature item, and choose one of the following categories that best fits the item: armor, clothing, tool, or weapon. Your signature item provides benefits based on the item’s category. You can use the benefits granted by your item as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining and the item is in your possession and not destroyed. These special benefits are an extension of your exceptional connection to the item, and they don’t function for others who wield or wear the item. Once per week, if your item is lost or destroyed, you can replace it with another item of the same category by spending 8 hours practicing with the new item. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace your signature item with a different one by spending 24 hours acclimating yourself to the replacement. If your new item is of a different category, you replace all benefits granted by the previous item with those of the new category.</p>\n<p>You gain the benefits of your expertise class feature only while your signature gear is in your possession. You only add your expertise die to the skills you select with your skill expertise class feature; you don’t automatically gain the ability to add your expertise die to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.nBrYkGfNBJAHe0xJ]{Sense Motive} checks. The first skill you select for skill expertise must be selected from a specific list based on your gear’s category.</p>\n<p><strong>This feature modifies expertise and replaces the envoy improvisation gained at 1st level.</strong></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.URYSLnmuiWX6zeLX]{Signature Armor (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.jPl2o74GP8AHH4Zx]{Signature Clothing (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.F4EngWnPxFG5bxzy]{Signature Tool (Ex)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.dkXUvt4wczLMnp5I]{Signature Weapon (Ex)}</p>"
