      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.oKlwvc1HcIsg7Q7a]{Fighting Style}</p>\n<p>Vast as space may be, the reality of starship rooms and space station corridors is far more cramped. The tunnel striker fighting style specializes in swiftly navigating, controlling, and clearing tight spaces, all while capitalizing on the devastating impact of area effects.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.TScrUTPa4tDvAJgf]{Kick in the Door (Ex) 1st Level}</h2><p>You easily knock aside barriers, allowing you to leap into whatever action lies beyond. Once per minute, you can either open a door as a swift action, open a door as part of an action used to move (such as charging, moving your speed, or taking a guarded step), or open a door as part of a full action used to make a full attack. You can open the door at any point during that action, such as moving part of your speed, opening a door, and then moving the remaining distance.</p>\n<p>You gain a +2 insight bonus to Strength checks to move or destroy obstacles, such as removing debris or breaking down a door. This bonus increases to +3 at 5th level and to +4 at 13th level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.jxAQaqCdjdZtvseh]{Flush Them Out (Ex) 5th Level}</h2><p>Foes fleeing your area attacks rarely guard against follow-up attacks. When you make a weapon attack that affects an area or multiple targets (such as a grenade or a weapon fired in automatic mode), any creature you hit with the attack or who fails their saving throw to reduce the damage becomes spooked until the end of your next turn. A spooked creature has the shaken condition while inside the area affected by your attack; outside the area affected by your attack, a spooked creature instead becomes flat-footed. After being spooked, a creature becomes immune to this ability for 1 hour. This is a fear effect.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.pVASk7dt8tuBKgUK]{Claustrophobic Comfort (Ex) 9th Level}</h2><p>You feel the safest in tight quarters. When squeezing through or into a space that isn’t as wide as your normal space, you can move at your normal speed, and you are not considered entangled as a result of squeezing. In addition, as long as you are adjacent to any combination of at least three walls, you gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. For this purpose, treat a floor or ceiling as a wall.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.y6285mWjji1UkgB9]{Rebounding Blast (Ex) 13th Level}</h2><p>Your explosive attacks ricochet in tight quarters. When you make an attack that targets an area, and obstacles block the attack from affecting at least half its usual area of effect, part of the effect bounces off those obstacles and makes the attack harder to avoid for those in the affected area. If your attack requires an attack roll to hit the targets’ Armor Classes, those targets are flat-footed against the attacks. If your attack instead provides a saving throw to reduce the damage taken, the affected creatures take a –2 penalty to their initial saving throw to resist the effect. For either type of attack, you can reroll any of the attack’s damage dice whose result is 1 and use the second result.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.tEZ4BKQUrVRb9cyx]{Secure the Area (Ex) 17th Level}</h2><p>As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to establish a secure area in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on you. The secure area does not move with you and lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your key ability score modifier (rounded down) or until you leave the area. While in the secure area, you and your allies each gain an additional reaction each round that can only be used to make attacks of opportunity, though affected creatures can still only take one reaction per triggering event. Additionally, you and each ally in the area increase any AC bonus from cover by 1, and you increase the DC of Acrobatics checks made to tumble through your threatened spaces by 3. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points while resting for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>You can also activate this ability as a full action rather than as a standard action. If you do, you can take a guarded step and ready an action to make an attack immediately before creating the secure area. If your readied action successfully damages one or more creatures in the secure area, you can increase the damage dealt to one of those creatures by an amount equal to half your soldier level.</p>"
