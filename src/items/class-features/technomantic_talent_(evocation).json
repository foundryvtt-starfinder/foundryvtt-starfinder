At 1st level, pick a school of magic and gain the listed effect. Unless otherwise noted, you can use each effect twice per day as a reaction when you, an ally, or an enemy within 60 feet casts a spell in that school, applying the effect to that triggering spell. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, you can invest in your technomantic talents, either increasing the effect of a school you’ve already chosen or choosing a new school.</p>\n<p><strong>Evocation:</strong> Instead of rolling damage dice normally for an evocation spell, you can first set one die to its maximum (or minimum) value. Each subsequent time you choose this as a technomantic talent, you can set another die to its maximum (or minimum) value, up to a maximum of 4 dice.</p>"
