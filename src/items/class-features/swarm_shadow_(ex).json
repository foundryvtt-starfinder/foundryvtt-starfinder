You provide your ally the benefits of your sheath array, including those gained from spending nanite surges or from knacks that affect your sheath array. While in this form, you share your ally’s space, automatically move where they move, and have concealment, allowing you to hide in plain sight. You can maintain this passive form for up to 1 hour per nanocyte level, and you can end the effect as a move action to appear in any empty space adjacent to your ally.</p>\n<p>While in this form, you can’t use equipment, but you can create two semisolid limbs that extend from your ally and share their reach, giving you two hands with which to wield equipment you create using one or more gear arrays. If you take a move action, standard action, full action, or attack of opportunity while in this form, it begins to destabilize, reducing the effect’s remaining duration to 1 round per nanocyte level.</p>"
