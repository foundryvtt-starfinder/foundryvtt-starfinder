Once you reboot a mind, you can’t use this ability again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>You can attempt to reboot the mind of an ally who is unwilling due to the influence of a mind-affecting effect. In this case, the ally can attempt a new saving throw against the effect at the same DC. If she succeeds, the ally can allow her mind to be rebooted, but if she fails, you waste the expended Resolve Point and action.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability to reboot your own mind. If you’re unable to take actions, you can reboot your mind without spending actions, but it must be the first thing you do on your turn, and you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} until the end of your next turn.</p>"
