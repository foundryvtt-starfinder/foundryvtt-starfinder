      "value": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.classes.cCZQpV0NmYE9qZoL]{Soldier}</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">You have a preferred fighting style that represents the type of soldier you are. Each fighting style is composed of various style techniques that you learn as you gain experience. You must pick one fighting style upon taking your first soldier level, and once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from appear on pages 112–115.&nbsp;<em>(Or Below)</em></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.zUIRCcSy6ulMxf32]{Arcane Assailant}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl01_LabelName\">The arcane assailant fighting style supplements its combat effectiveness with magic powers, drawing on traditions of warrior-wizards dating back to well before the Gap. This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don’t have a magic weapon in your possession.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.DAMcKQ3EGXdh8CGe]{Armor Storm}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl02_LabelName\">The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment normally beyond your armor’s capacity.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.AKI0TQ3pSwmU5twg]{Blitz}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl04_LabelName\">The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.<br></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.YHaMYdptLi3fXfVH]{Bombard}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl05_LabelName\">The bombard fighting style emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.oHKHSbFfmBgFfvW8]{Guard}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl08_LabelName\">The guard fighting style focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Jba9qeZX5QgjZvwQ]{Hit-and-Run}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl09_LabelName\">The hit-and-run fighting style focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to move even when you make full attacks and to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.PSAr1JTGPZQ9g1j8]{Sharpshoot}</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl13_LabelName\">The sharpshoot fighting style enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.</span></p>",
