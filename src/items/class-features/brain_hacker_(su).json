For the purpose of determining the effects of your technomancer spells, you treat all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher as if they were both their original type and subtype and constructs with the technological subtype, whichever is more beneficial for you. This ability allows you to heal living creatures with spells like mending and make whole, as if they were constructs.</p>"
