The secure area does not move with you and lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your key ability score modifier (rounded down) or until you leave the area. While in the secure area, you and your allies each gain an additional reaction each round that can only be used to make attacks of opportunity, though affected creatures can still only take one reaction per triggering event. Additionally, you and each ally in the area increase any AC bonus from cover by 1, and you increase the DC of Acrobatics checks made to tumble through your threatened spaces by 3. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points while resting for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>You can also activate this ability as a full action rather than as a standard action. If you do, you can take a guarded step and ready an action to make an attack immediately before creating the secure area. If your readied action successfully damages one or more creatures in the secure area, you can increase the damage dealt to one of those creatures by an amount equal to half your soldier level.</p>"
