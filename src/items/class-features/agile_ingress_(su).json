As a move action, you can change the area illuminated by your solar manifestation to a cone with a length equal to twice the normal radius of your manifestation, or to a line with a length equal to four times the normal radius. This lasts for as long as your solar manifestation is formed, or until you change it back to its standard shape or to a different shape as a move action. When you’re attuned or fully attuned, you can intensify the light created as part of the move action you take to use Acrobatics to tumble through a threatened area. If you succeed at the Acrobatics check, you can cause your solar manifestation’s light to deal 1d4 fire damage to one creature that threatens that space. This damage increases by 1d4 for every 4 solarian levels you have (maximum 6d4 at 20th level), and a creature can halve the damage with a successful Reflex saving throw. Once a creature has taken fire damage from this manifestation, they’re immune to its damage for 1 minute.</p>"
