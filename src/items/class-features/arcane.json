During this time, enemies that enter or begin their turn in a space adjacent to you take fire damage equal to the level of the spell you cast. When you would take damage from an attack or spell, you can end your scouring aura as a reaction to reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to twice the level of the spell you cast (minimum 0 damage).</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.L3KtPLzxTXV9VwKC]{Spell Echo (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a reaction whenever you cast a spell that has no effect (such as the affected creatures all succeeding at saving throws or being immune), you can spend a number of Resolve Points equal to half the spell’s level (rounded up) to capture the spell’s magical energy and retain it as a spell echo for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Once during this time, you can cast the captured spell a second time by expending the spell echo instead of expending a spell slot. You can have only one spell echo at a time.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Q5YAkuyoA2QaPem5]{Arcane Manipulation (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point when casting a spell to augment it in one of the following ways: the spell’s duration increases by 50%, the spell’s range increases by 50%, or the spell’s damage increases by an amount equal to half your mystic level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.qVlM72gmwtH6ETiG]{Eldritch Sense (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Whenever your scouring aura is active, you can sense magical energy. This grants you blindsense (magic) for a range of 10 feet × the level of the spell that triggered scouring aura, which senses nearby magic in the area as detect magic.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.GmuRlm9NyNIUM8PZ]{Spell Consumption (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain spell resistance equal to 6 + your mystic level. As a reaction when you would be the target of a spell, you can increase your spell resistance to 11 + your mystic level against that spell. Once you’ve used this reaction, you can’t use it again until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. Once per hour, when a spell fails to overcome your spell resistance, you absorb part of that spell’s energy and use it to fuel your spellcasting; you regain an expended 1st-level mystic spell slot.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.rcvZUePhbAqT3JnJ]{Unleash Magic (Sp) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day as a standard action, you unleash a burst of raw magic in a 30-foot radius around you, dealing 12d6 damage to every creature in the area (Reflex half). Each time you use unleash magic, you decide if it deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. You can expend a mystic spell slot when using this ability to exclude a number of squares up to the level of the spell slot expended from the area of unleash magic. You can activate unleash magic additional times per day by expending 1 Resolve Point each time after the first.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.gqxuIi4P9XTq3Ssk]{Suppressing Aura (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can end your scouring aura as a standard action to cast greater dispel magic. You can spend 2 Resolve Points to use this as a reaction instead.</p>"
