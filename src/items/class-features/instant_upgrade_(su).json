The armor must have the available armor upgrade slots to accommodate the upgrade, and the upgrade’s item level can’t exceed three times the expended spell slot’s level. The armor gains the chosen upgrade for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence bonus.</p>\n<p>If the upgrade requires a standard action or move action to activate a persistent effect, such as a force field’s effect, the creature wearing the armor can choose to activate that effect as part of this magic hack. If the upgrade has a capacity, it comes fully charged. The armor can’t gain an upgrade it already has or one that can’t be installed in armor of its type.</p>"
