The armor must have the available armor upgrade slots to accommodate the upgrade, and the upgrade&rsquo;s item level can&rsquo;t exceed three times the expended spell slot&rsquo;s level. The armor gains the chosen upgrade for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence bonus.</p>\n<p>If the upgrade requires a standard action or move action to activate a persistent effect, such as a force field&rsquo;s effect, the creature wearing the armor can choose to activate that effect as part of this magic hack. If the upgrade has a capacity, it comes fully charged. The armor can&rsquo;t gain an upgrade it already has or one that can&rsquo;t be installed in armor of its type.</p>"
