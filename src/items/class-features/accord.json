You can perform a ritual that takes 15 minutes to link yourself to a number of adjacent allies that does not exceed your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), after which each remains mystically linked to you for 24 hours. This connection lasts until they’re more than 1 mile away from you, or until you perform this ritual again. As part of the ritual, you and any linked allies can each spend 1 Resolve Point. Any expended Resolve Points are added to a communal pool of Resolve Points that you can use only in specific ways granted by this connection’s abilities. When you perform this ritual again, any of these stored Resolve Points are lost. You can perform this ritual as part of the 15-minute period of concentration needed to regain your daily spell slots.</p>\n<p>You can use your connection abilities to affect allies you can perceive within 30 feet of you. This range increases to 60 feet at 6th level, 90 feet at 12th level, and 150 feet at 18th level. At 9th level, if the communal pool gains at least 3 Resolve Points after completing the ritual, increase the pool’s total Resolve Points by 1.</p>\n<p>As a reaction when you or a linked ally within range is dying and would spend or lose at least 1 Resolve Point due to taking damage, stabilizing, or staying in the fight, you can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool to reduce the number of Resolve Points spent or lost by 2 (minimum 0 RP). If this reduced the cost to stabilize or stay in the fight, the linked creature also gains temporary Hit Points equal to your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier for 1d4 rounds. You can use this ability on yourself (though not on others) once per round without spending an action while you are dying.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.vMcJIOq6pmnvz0Ts]{Pact of Assistance (Ex) 3rd Level}</h2><p>You’re especially adept at advising, helping, and directing your chosen allies. When you use the aid another, covering fire, or harrying fire action to assist a linked ally, you increase the bonus granted from that action to +3. When you succeed at an attack roll or skill check to perform one of these actions, you can expend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool to grant its benefit to up to 3 linked allies within range.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.k5sxx7SxPYB2lo4x]{Pact of Defense (Su) 6th Level}</h2><p>As a reaction when an effect simultaneously affects at least two linked allies (or you and at least one linked ally) and provides a saving throw to reduce its effects, you can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool to bolster the linked creatures’ saving throws. Determine which of the affected linked allies has the highest saving throw modifier against the effect’s first save; each linked ally affected by the effect uses that saving throw modifier instead of their own modifier.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.GA6ewjRCfGL2xW6H]{Pact of Coordination (Su) 9th Level}</h2><p>When you or a linked ally make an attack or use an ability that affects an area that contains one or more linked allies within range, you can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool as a reaction to shield each linked ally in the affected area. Shielded creatures halve any initial damage from the effect and gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the attack. If the effect deals less damage on a successful save, a shielded ally who succeeds at that save instead takes no damage from the initial effect.</p>\n<p>This ability only affects the immediate effects of conventional weapons, spells, and similar effects. It doesn’t affect massive effects and hazards caused by collateral damage (such as orbital starship weapon attacks or debris from a collapsing building).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.kKHyQHBYiBqimyOW]{Pact of Focus (Su) 12th Level}</h2><p>While you have at least 1 Resolve Point in your communal pool, you and your allies gain benefits from watching out for one another. So long as at least half of you and your linked allies are not flat-footed, then none of you become flat\u0002footed when flanked. So long as at least half of you and your linked allies can precisely perceive a creature, then none of you are flat-footed against that creature’s attacks, even if it is unseen. As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool to share one of the following abilities possessed by you or a linked ally within range with yourself and all linked allies within range for 1d4 rounds: blindsense, darkvision, low-light vision, or the effects of see invisibility. You can share a linked ally’s blindsight in this way, but the recipients instead gain blindsense with the same range and medium.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.G1LG8rvglH3aYzrf]{Pact of Victory (Su) 15th Level}</h2><p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool as a move action to condemn a creature within range. As a standard action before the end of your next turn, you can make one attack against the condemned creature, gaining benefits based on the number of linked allies who have damaged the condemned creature since you activated this ability. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to hit if at least one linked ally damaged the target, and this increases to +3 if all linked allies damaged them. Your attack deals an additional 1d12 untyped damage for each ally who damaged the target (maximum 5d12 damage). For each ally who damaged the target, you reduce any miss chance affecting the target by 10% (minimum 0% miss chance). Finally, you can choose for your attack to gain the nonlethal weapon special property. After you affect a creature with this ability, they become immune to further uses for 24 hours.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.r3941nCuQZ6XD1Q5]{Pact of Transposition (Su) 18th Level}</h2><p>In a flurry of movement, you rearrange the battlefield, allowing your companions to trade places and provide critical support for each other in an instant. Once per day, you can spend 2 Resolve Points from your communal pool to relocate any combination of yourself and your linked allies within range. You teleport any number of the linked creatures, causing each one to trade places with yourself or a linked ally so long as each creature can fit within the vacated space. Each creature teleported in this way can choose to donate up to 20 Stamina Points they have to any one other creature that was teleported. Finally, each teleported creature gains the benefit of aid another, covering fire, or harrying fire as if you had successfully performed that action. This is a teleportation effect.</p>"
