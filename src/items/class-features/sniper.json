      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.classes.uf8ADOAeBrtUkPVl]{Operative}</p>\n<p>You’re a skilled sharpshooter who deals death over vast distances with sniper weapons. As a full action, you can move up to 1/4 your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative property, a small arm, or a sniper weapon. If the weapon has the sniper property, you can use the property as if you had used a move action to aim. Just before making your attack, attempt a Perception or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization) with a DC of 20 + 1-1/2 your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check, the target is flat-footed against the attack and you deal 1d3 additional damage. This damage increases to 1d6 additional damage at 3rd level, plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 levels thereafter. You can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property unless it also has the sniper special property, in which case this ability doesn’t allow you to move before attacking. This ability counts as a trick attack for the purpose of other operative abilities, such as debilitating trick.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces the operative’s trick attack class feature.</strong></p>"
