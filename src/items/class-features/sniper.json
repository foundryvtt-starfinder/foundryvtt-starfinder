As a full action, you can move up to 1/4 your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative property, a small arm, or a sniper weapon. If the weapon has the sniper property, you can use the property as if you had used a move action to aim. Just before making your attack, attempt a Perception or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization) with a DC of 20 + 1-1/2 your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check, the target is flat-footed against the attack and you deal 1d3 additional damage. This damage increases to 1d6 additional damage at 3rd level, plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 levels thereafter. You can&rsquo;t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property unless it also has the sniper special property, in which case this ability doesn&rsquo;t allow you to move before attacking. This ability counts as a trick attack for the purpose of other operative abilities, such as debilitating trick.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces the operative&rsquo;s trick attack class feature.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
