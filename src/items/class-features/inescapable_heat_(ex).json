For 1 minute, whenever the creature takes cold or fire damage, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{shaken} for 1 round. The first time during that minute the creature begins its turn with the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{burning} condition, it becomes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{confused} for the duration of the burning effect (Will negates). However, on a d% result of 51–75 to determine the confused creature’s actions (Core Rulebook274), the creature attempts to end the burning condition rather than dealing damage to itself. At the start of each subsequent turn, the creature can attempt a new Will save, ending the confused condition immediately on a success. This is a fear and pain effect.</p>"
