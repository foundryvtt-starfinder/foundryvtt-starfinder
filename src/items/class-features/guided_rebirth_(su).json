While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.RxvbSB9ZgSCBu2jw]{Helpless}. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to animal, humanoid (of any subtype), or your original type, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate. This change does not alter your ability scores, Hit Points, Stamina Points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Each time you make this transformation, you are cleansed of all @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, are restored to full Hit Points and Stamina Points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a type other than your current type every time you make the transformation. You can use this ability once per day. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t regain Resolve Points until you rest for 8 hours, even if you have another means to do so.</p>",
