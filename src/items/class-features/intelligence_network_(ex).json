This may be a collection of operatives and spies you have infiltrated, a connection to a formal information broker you trade tidbits of knowledge with, or an assemblage of allies and informants you’ve carefully curated over your travels.</p>\n<p>You can make an inquiry to your intelligence network as long as you have access to an infosphere or communication device with at least system-wide range. This gives you the same information you would gain from casting the vision spell, except you make a special class level check (1d20 + your operative level) in place of a caster level check, it does not require a Resolve Point, and it takes 1d4 weeks for your network to get an answer to you. Your network can work on only one question at a time, and if you make a new request before a previous one is fulfilled, all time spend on the original question is lost, and you take a –1 penalty to your new class level check due to confusion and lack of focus among your network.</p>"
