You are adept at sensing and reshaping the fundamental connections in matter, manipulating the physical world around you. Although you’re good at taking things apart, you delight in building as well, bringing structures into being with the power of thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.vIgmW8C54qgxPqUg]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.pq08s1mZZyi97PBA]{Damoritosh}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.kN8pC8Yfi8OuCvig]{Eloritu}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.bPtB2HxRcO7AYWyf]{Ibra}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.npmy97Y5pefRTHx1]{Iomedae}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.rUtAoz8NUGCZR4yz]{Yaraesa}</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Two from among @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.IqOCYDKd9NgBwowp]{Computers}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.76u4HnGcAlySicb4]{Engineering}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.tVUA3IPcOfyU1g19]{Life Science}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.w7NNLCayniMsh3ne]{Physical Science}, or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.bD4kmdFU7wwsenOf]{Profession} (in a crafting profession).</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st-6th @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.3I4iNxI1qfObcKPF]{Ectoplasmic Barrage}; replaced by 1st - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.xPgI0T3aaPQnHE2Y]{Grease}, 2nd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.fiFr41dYjlAxJlwn]{Make Whole}, 3rd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.4prroV3z26u1cy5y]{Slow}, 4th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.CO9wzmYbZjeijJUc]{Ectoplasmic Eruption}, 5th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.1CnhToMdnMd1PN4G]{Rapid Repair}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.D2t4rnYWrlZDzHPF]{Matter Field (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can surround yourself with a field of swirling debris and “hardened” air. This field grants you temporary Hit Points and fortification as if it were a force field with an item level equal to or lower than your mystic level. This field doesn’t block gases, liquids, or light. If the field drops to 0 temporary Hit Points, it ends. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 × your mystic level, but these rounds need not be consecutive. In general, it can be assumed you have enough air or loose matter around you to use this ability, but in some circumstances, such as when you are surrounded by vacuum, the GM is free to rule that this ability can function only if you can provide a source of matter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.b7Tcd5E3v09pkvE7]{Matter Sense (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You develop a feel for the movement of matter around you. You gain blindsense (vibration) with a range of 30 feet, and you gain the Blind Fight feat. If you already have blindsense (vibration), increase its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MffwoUuFX1saPrUK]{Shape Matter (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can shape unformed matter into items you need. To do so, you follow the rules outlined on page 235 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook, using the exceptions that follow. You need no tools or workshop, only your will and matter to rearrange— UPBs or an existing item. An existing item imparts only 10% of its value toward the cost of your creation. In any case, the raw materials must be in your possession and can’t be carried or worn by another creature or exist as part of a structure. Creating an item this way takes 10 minutes. However, if your number of ranks in the appropriate skill to craft an item exceeds that item’s level by 5 or more, you can craft that item in 1 minute. If your ranks exceed the item level by 10 or more, you can create the item as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If you create an item that has daily uses (such as a magic item) or charges (such as a battery) with this ability, the item starts with no uses or charges available but can be recharged normally. However, consumable items function normally. Items you create or convert using this ability can have no more bulk than you have mystic levels and can’t exceed Large size.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.k784iwD8SP5T2gds]{Apportation (Sp) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over material objects and are able to transport small amounts of matter from one spot to another without those objects crossing the intervening space. A number of times per day equal to half your mystic level, you can teleport a nonliving, inanimate object that you are touching and that has up to 2 bulk up to 500 feet away. You do not need to be able to see the destination, but you must be able to clearly describe it, such as “500 feet north.” If the object would arrive in an occupied space, this ability fails but is still expended. Alternatively, you can teleport an object within 500 feet to yourself; you must be able to clearly identify both the object and its current location. You can choose to be holding the object when it arrives, if you are able to hold it; otherwise, the object arrives on the ground in your space.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.7hIQ7ML6t0nAyICK]{Phasing (Sp) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can temporarily cause your body and gear to become out of phase with other matter. For a number of rounds per day equal to your mystic level, as a move action, you can phase. These rounds need not be consecutive. When you’re phased, you can pass through walls or material objects other than corporeal creatures, provided you begin and end your turn outside of the object. During a round in which you phase, attackers who target you with attacks and effects have a 20% miss chance, and you take only half damage from area effects. Force effects block your phasing and have no miss chance or reduced damage when targeting or affecting you. You cease phasing if you are incapable of thinking.</p>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow up to one willing creature per 3 mystic levels you have to phase with you, provided such creatures are within 30 feet of you when you phase. However, each additional creature you phase consumes 1 round of your phasing duration each round it remains phased, and it ceases being phased when you do or if it strays more than 90 feet from you. If a creature is part of your mystic telepathic bond, however, it consumes 1 round the first round it is phased and 1 additional round every other round thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hXfGudMaFYNFlAlY]{Molecular Wall (Sp) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>Up to two times per day, you can manipulate the air and minuscule amounts of matter around you to create a protective field. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use wall of force as a spell-like ability. As with matter field, the GM can rule that you lack sufficient matter to create such a field, depending on your circumstances. In this case, you can create the wall out of psychic matter (sometimes called ectoplasm) that you will into temporary existence. When you do this, the wall costs you 1 additional Resolve Point and lasts half as long.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can create your matter field out of the same psychic matter you can use to create molecular walls. If you do, each round your matter field exists expends 2 rounds from your daily uses of matter field.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.o3fPRrAiclGesrFR]{Translocation (Sp) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can invert the matter of the universe, creating a portal to other worlds. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to use&nbsp;<em>interplanetary teleport</em> as a spell-like ability. You can instead expend the use of this ability and 2 Resolve Points to use&nbsp;<em>plane shift</em>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability.</p>"
