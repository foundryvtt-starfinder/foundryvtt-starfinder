You must pick one niche upon taking your first evolutionist level, and once made this choice can’t be changed. Descriptions of the niches you can choose from appear on pages 14–15.</p>\n<p>Each niche grants you several benefits and affects several of your other class features. If a niche ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities) the DC is equal to 10 + half your evolutionist level + your key ability score modifier unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p><strong>1st Level:</strong> Your niche grants you a unique evolutionist adaptation and the listed skill as a bonus class skill. In addition, the niche affects several of your other class features: your niche provides a unique instinct and a unique drawback that affects your evolution track ability, determines which augmentations your augmented form ability affects at 2nd level, and determines one of the skills enhanced by your skill boost ability at 3rd level.</p>\n<p><strong>10th Level:</strong> Your transformation has reached an important milestone, giving you an ability you can use once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>20th Level:</strong> You have completed your transformation. Your creature type changes to one of the creature types associated with your niche. In addition, you become immune to one or more effects based on your niche, plus two additional effects of your choice from the following list: bleed, death effects, disease, fatigued (including exhausted), negative levels, nonlethal damage, paralysis, poison, sleep, or stun.</p>\n<p><em>Add your chosen Niche's Class Skill to the Class Skills of Evolutionist Class item's Details tab.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The following are the most common evolutionist niches</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.yZovkmDKDVGekc71]{Eldritch (Niche)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.NdImg3Bt0PzTvwgt]{Mechanized (Niche)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.zHgAiowY2vsjycXI]{Sepulchral (Niche)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.gY3X6RQyqwjMVTkC]{Vital (Niche)}</p>"
