As a move action, you can add one of these spells to your list of technomancer spells known for 1 minute. If you have the cache capacitor class feature and you could add that spell to one of your cache capacitorâ€™s slots, you can add the spell to your cache capacitor during this time to extend its duration as described by that class feature. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use adaptable spell knowledge again before the duration expires, you replace the previous spell with your new choice. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one spell you selected with this ability with another choice.</span></p>"
