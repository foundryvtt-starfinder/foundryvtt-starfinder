You might be a diplomat, an investigator, a mind-reading bodyguard, a ship’s psychologist, or a psychic con artist.<br><br><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Abadar, Hylax, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Talavet, Triune (Casandalee)<br><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Perception and Sense Motive<br><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.moyeAHT4yzZVWmmg]{Detect Thoughts}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.V3mnCtb962WQlICq]{Zone of Truth}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.4Z6WeMM9uJ1U0wG6]{Clairaudience/Clairvoyance}, 4th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.Yw8a8A1rjbLXkcpr]{Mind Probe}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.Xyo1RrE1atT6Aklc]{Telepathy}, 6th -&nbsp;</span>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.VvCP8MdSZtXREp2x]{True Seeing}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.aQQYD95bZwgScNsu]{Empathy (Su) - 1st Level}&nbsp;</h2>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">As a full action, you can attempt a Sense Motive check to read the emotions of a particular creature (DC = 20 or 10 + its Bluff modifier, whichever is higher). If you succeed, you learn its general disposition and attitude toward creatures within 30 feet of it, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against that creature for 1 hour. Whether you succeed or fail, after opening your mind to read emotions, you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for 1 minute.<br></span></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.pSliBXyC3sD2gisa]{Greater Mindlink (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">You can use your mindlink ability on the same creature as many times per day as you wish, and the communication can be both ways, though the maximum of 10 minutes of communication per round still applies.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ANnBCC8Rx1u5qyDS]{Emotionsense (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">You can detect and locate creatures within 60 feet that have emotions, as if you had blindsense (emotion); see page 262. A creature can keep its emotions calm to avoid detection by this ability by succeeding at a Bluff check with a DC equal to 10 + your Sense Motive modifier, but a creature under the influence of an emotion effect cannot try to avoid detection. Creatures under the effects of <em>nondetection</em> or similar effects automatically avoid detection by this ability. Unless otherwise stated, constructs and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower don’t have emotions and can’t be sensed this way.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.k29n29i0Y9mAgrY9]{Discern Lies (Sp) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">You can use <em>discern lies</em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level, each time targeting a single creature. This effect lasts 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NqF4ziNsyBrJvIFl]{Greater Emotionsense (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">Your emotionsense is far more discerning, as if you had blindsight (emotion); see page 262.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.UKOpnFFzqflPY9c5]{Retrocognition (Sp) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">You can use <em>retrocognition</em> as a spell-like ability at will. When doing so, you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for as long as you concentrate on <em>retrocognition</em> and an equal amount of time afterward. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate this penalty.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.DsRf0jXOlFZFq9Yl]{Empathic Mastery (Sp) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p class=\"title\">You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use <em>psychic surgery</em> as a spell-like ability. If you are incapacitated by an effect that <em>psychic surgery</em> could remove and have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability on yourself, even without being able to take any actions.</p>",
