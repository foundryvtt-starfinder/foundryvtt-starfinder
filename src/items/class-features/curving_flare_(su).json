When you make a ranged attack with your solar flare as a standard action and hit, you can use a move action to make a second ranged attack with your solar flare. This second attack is made at a –8 penalty (–6 if you’re attuned or fully attuned) and must be made against a different target than the first attack. You determine line of sight and the range of this attack starting from one corner of the space occupied by the target of the first attack. The second attack is treated as an attack in a full attack for the purposes of abilities that reduce the penalties for full attacks. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation.</span></p>",
