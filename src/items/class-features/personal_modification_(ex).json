Your body synthesizes the organic material for the augmentation and you magically manipulate your DNA strands to integrate it into the biological system of your choice. Once implanted, the personal augmentation occupies that system, preventing the installation of any other upgrade, and you can only remove or implant the augmentation in a new system through the transform biotech class feature (see below). The personal augmentation provides a benefit based on which of your bodyâ€™s systems you implant it in, as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Arms (all)</strong>: Treat your Strength score as 6 higher for the purpose of determining your bulk limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: Add one Intelligence-based skill to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using that skill, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Ears</strong>: You take no penalty to sound-based Perception checks when you are sleeping, and gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects that would deafen you.</p>\n<p><strong>Eyes</strong>: For targets you attack, reduce the miss chance due to concealment to 15%. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks based on sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Feet (all)</strong>: You can move through up to 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. This allows you to take a guarded step into difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Hands (All)</strong>: You can attempt Sleight of Hand checks as if you were trained in the skill, and you can retrieve a weapon or object hidden on your person in the same amount of time it would take to retrieve it were it not hidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: Add Bluff to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using Bluff to lie, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Legs (all)</strong>: Gain a +1 bonus to your AC against combat maneuvers that would change your position, such as bull rush, reposition, or trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Lungs</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against thick, severely thick, thin, and severely thin atmospheres, as well as against gas effects that are negated by not needing to breathe (such as a smoke grenade).</p>\n<p><strong>Skin:</strong>&nbsp;You are protected from the dangers of extreme heat and cold as if you were wearing armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Spinal Column</strong>: Add Acrobatics to your list of associated skills for your connection. You can take 10 when using Acrobatics to balance, even if you are threatened or distracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Throat</strong>: Your voice is augmented, allowing you to be heard clearly even in extremely loud areas, such as windstorms and even hurricane-force winds. Creatures in such areas take no penalty to Perception checks to hear your voice.</p>\n<p><em>Toggle on/off for modifier for lungs or arms</em></p>"
