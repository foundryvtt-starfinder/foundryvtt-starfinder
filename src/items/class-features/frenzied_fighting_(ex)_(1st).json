While frenzied, you gain a +2 bonus to melee damage rolls and Will saves, as well as a –1 penalty to AC.<br>At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus to melee damage rolls granted by your frenzy increases by 1. While frenzied, you can’t use any ability that requires patience or concentration, such as spellcasting. or any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills except Acrobatics, Intimidate, and Piloting. After your frenzy ends, you can’t use this ability again until after you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>",
