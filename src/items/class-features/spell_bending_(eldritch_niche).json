Attempt a Fortitude save, using the spell’s save DC as your saving throw’s DC. If you fail, you choose the spell’s targets, measure the spell’s range from your space, and make any attack rolls for the spell as if you were the caster, though the original spellcaster makes any caster level checks, rolls any damage, and is responsible for controlling and concentrating on any subsequent effects of the spell. If you succeed at the save, you can redirect the spell as if you had failed, but you also apply one of the following three special effects to the spell.</p>\n<p>•You increase the spell’s saving throw DCs by 2, to a maximum of 10 + half your evolutionist level + your key ability score modifier.</p>\n<p>•The spellcaster’s caster level is treated as 2 higher for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance, to a maximum of your evolutionist level + 1.</p>\n<p>•If the spell deals damage, you can replace your adaptive strike’s damage with one damage type dealt by the spell until the end of your next turn. This effect doesn’t change whether your adaptive strike targets KAC or EAC.</p>"
