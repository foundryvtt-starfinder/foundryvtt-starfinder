You are dedicated to defending the weak, and destroying evil and tyranny. This connection can be taken only by characters of good alignment.<br><br><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Iomedae, Sarenrae<br><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Diplomacy and Mysticism<br><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.MTHL2TQjb7tWuZVS]{Reflecting Armor}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.qbeQtgCtP8avY2ny]{Shield Other}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.PecEOjojT15BJKi9]{Haste},</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">4th - </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.QtZHSuJf0hcryYtR]{Death Ward}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.D6MCR522HZUBYWSA]{Resistant Aegis}, 6th - <em>greater resistant armor</em><br><br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.oY4IZxHjG5Cl0oQi]{Weapon Proficiency (Ex) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>Crusaders receive more martial training than most mystics, focusing on weapons favored by their deities. You gain proficiency with advanced melee weapons, and at 3rd level you gain Weapon Specialization with them. If you are already proficient with advanced melee weapons, you instead gain one bonus combat feat you meet the prerequisites for.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.4sEd88PeeH1tsbJf]{Sworn Protector (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>At the start of each turn, you can designate one ally within 30 feet of you as being under your protection. As a reaction when an attack hits the selected ally, you can make one melee or ranged attack against the enemy who made the attack. If your attack hits, it deals no damage, but that enemy gains the off-target condition until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7lwTtZ6rne5ft5GZ]{Smite Evil (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day as a move action, you can infuse one weapon you touch, granting it the holy weapon fusion. If the weapon scores a critical hit against an evil creature, it applies the wound critical hit effect in addition to any other critical hit effect the weapon has. If the weapon already has the wound critical hit effect, it instead gains the severe wound or staggered critical hit effect (your choice). The weapon retains these benefits for 1 minute per mystic level. You can activate smite evil additional times per day by expending 1 Resolve Point each time after the first.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.CB4MnGLnO271NDhi]{Sacred Weapon (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to add one of the following weapon fusions to one weapon of your choice: <em>axiomatic</em>, <em>holy</em>, <em>merciful</em>, or <em>returning</em>. The weapon retains this fusion for 24 hours or until you use this ability again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.7TOcXuYmYsJJiREI]{Divine Protection (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>You gain a +2 divine bonus to saving throws against fear effects and against diseases, including magical and supernatural diseases. In addition, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a disease, you are cured of that disease.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ulyvuWktj9uotoGT]{Radiant Aura (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to create a 60-foot emanation centered on you that lasts 1 hour. This aura provides the benefits of your divine protection to creatures of your choice inside the area.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2B2TeCvcwDlKVxap]{Guardian Angel (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>If damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, even if you would die, you can expend 3 Resolve Points to stay alive and conscious with 1 Hit Point. You can use this ability as a reaction when another creature you can see drops to 0 Hit Points, expending 3 Resolve Points to allow that creature to stay alive and conscious with 1 Hit Point. Once you use this ability, you can do so again only after you rest for 8 hours.</p>",
