To use this ability, you must be within 60 feet of both an ally and your ally’s target, the latter which must have taken damage from a nonlethal attack within the last minute. If your ally would reduce the target to 0 HP—and the attack doesn’t deal damage that equals or exceeds half the target’s maximum Hit Points—then, as a reaction, you can have the target merely fall unconscious from the attack as though the attack had dealt nonlethal damage.</p>"
