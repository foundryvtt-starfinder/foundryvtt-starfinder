You must target a single creature with your attack, and the spell&rsquo;s area is centered on that creature, or originates at the creature&rsquo;s location for a cone or line effect (oriented in whichever direction you choose), even if the spell would normally be centered on or originate from a point. You can fire the weapon as part of the standard action to cast the spell, dealing damage as normal if you hit. You must fire the weapon during the round that the casting is completed, or the spell is wasted. If the attack misses, the spell is wasted. Spells with an emanation effect that would be centered on you don&rsquo;t benefit from this magic hack.</span></p>"
