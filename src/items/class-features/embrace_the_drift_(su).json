You no longer need to breathe and are immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and a vacuum. You can automatically sense the direction and relative distance of the nearest five Drift beacons, and you can navigate to Alluvion as though you had a beacon code. While you’re on a starship with a Drift engine, you treat the rating of that Drift engine as 1 higher (maximum 6). While you’re in the Drift, you have a supernatural fly speed of 90 feet (perfect maneuverability).</p>\n<p>Your body functions as a personal Drift engine. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you can spend 1, 4, 9, or 16 Resolve Points to enter the Drift, navigate the plane using the rules for Drift navigation, and (optionally) exit to the Material Plane as though you had a Drift engine rating of 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. While doing so, you can use either Mysticism or Piloting to navigate.</p>"
