Any ally who readies a similar action—such as making an attack, even if with a different type of weapon—with the same trigger before you take your readied action gains a +1 morale bonus to their first attack roll or skill check performed as part of the readied action. If the readied action requires a skill check to which you can apply your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.0HPp0nK0L1VawPYN]{skill expertise}, you can forego rolling the die and instead choose one ally whoreadied the same action; that ally rolls your expertise die and applies the result as an insight bonus to their check. If the readied action involves an attack roll, you can roll your expertise die and add its result to the damage dealt by one ally who also readied an attack and successfully hit the target. Once a creature benefits from this improvisation, it can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>"
