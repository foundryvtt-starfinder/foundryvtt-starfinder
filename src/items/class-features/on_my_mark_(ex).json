Any ally who readies a similar action—such as making an attack, even if with a different type of weapon—with the same trigger before you take your readied action gains a +1 morale bonus to their first attack roll or skill check performed as part of the readied action. If the readied action requires a skill check to which you can apply your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.0HPp0nK0L1VawPYN]{skill expertise}, you can forego rolling the die and instead choose one ally who readied the same action; that ally rolls your expertise die and applies the result as an insight bonus to their check. If the readied action involves an attack roll, you can roll your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.OzwMoyrdE3fcNZLP]{expertise} die and add its result to the damage dealt by one ally who also readied an attack and successfully hit the target. Once a creature benefits from this improvisation, it can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>"
