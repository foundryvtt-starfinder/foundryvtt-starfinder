You can perform a ritual that takes 15 minutes to link yourself to a number of adjacent allies that does not exceed your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), after which each remains mystically linked to you for 24 hours. This connection lasts until they’re more than 1 mile away from you, or until you perform this ritual again. As part of the ritual, you and any linked allies can each spend 1 Resolve Point. Any expended Resolve Points are added to a communal pool of Resolve Points that you can use only in specific ways granted by this connection’s abilities. When you perform this ritual again, any of these stored Resolve Points are lost. You can perform this ritual as part of the 15-minute period of concentration needed to regain your daily spell slots.</p>\n<p>You can use your connection abilities to affect allies you can perceive within 30 feet of you. This range increases to 60 feet at 6th level, 90 feet at 12th level, and 150 feet at 18th level. At 9th level, if the communal pool gains at least 3 Resolve Points after completing the ritual, increase the pool’s total Resolve Points by 1.</p>\n<p>As a reaction when you or a linked ally within range is dying and would spend or lose at least 1 Resolve Point due to taking damage, stabilizing, or staying in the fight, you can spend 1 Resolve Point from your communal pool to reduce the number of Resolve Points spent or lost by 2 (minimum 0 RP). If this reduced the cost to stabilize or stay in the fight, the linked creature also gains temporary Hit Points equal to your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier for 1d4 rounds. You can use this ability on yourself (though not on others) once per round without spending an action while you are dying.</p>"
