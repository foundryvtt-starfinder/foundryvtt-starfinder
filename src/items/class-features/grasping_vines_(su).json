The target surface must be solid but does not need to be capable of sustaining plants normally. The vines have a reach of 5 feet and attempt to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area; such a creature must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the entangled condition. Creatures that successfully save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must attempt a new save at the end of your turn each round. Creatures moving into the area must attempt a save immediately; failure ends their movement and they become entangled. An entangled creature can break free as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or DC 15 Strength check. The vines last for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level, and the entire area is difficult terrain while the effect lasts. At 11th level, the vines can reach 10 feet and sprout thorns that deal 1d6 piercing damage each round to creatures in the area.</p>"
