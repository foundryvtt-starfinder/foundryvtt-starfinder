The ally’s effect has half the normal duration. If the adaptation has a randomized result (such as a number of Stamina Points regained) the ally receives half the normal number. If the adaptation would modify an adaptive strike the ally doesn’t have, they can apply the effect to their unarmed strikes instead.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.KfvDKmqJUGQ7EDCK]{Advanced (13th Level)}:</strong> You can use your basic focus ability to share an adaptation with up to two willing allies instead of one and the affected allies must be within 15 feet of you.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.7i1AQmxC3B4UDxcv]{Ultimate (19th Level)}:</strong> You can use your basic focus ability to share an adaptation with any number of willing allies within 20 feet.</p>"
