As a move action, you can flicker in and out of existence, granting you a 20% miss chance against attacks and reducing the damage you take from area effects by an amount equal to your witchwarper level. The miss chance increases to 25% at 9th level and to 30% at 15th level. Unlike the miss chance granted by concealment, the flicker effect’s miss chance isn’t overcome by special senses such as blindsight. You can flicker only for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level, though these rounds need not be consecutive.</span></p>"
