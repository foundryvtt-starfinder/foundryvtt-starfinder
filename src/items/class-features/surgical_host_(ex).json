While you’re within reach of your cloud array, you can also perform Medicine checks on creatures in or adjacent to the cloud as though they were within your reach. For both forms, you perform Medicine checks as though you’re using a basic medkit; at 5th level, you instead perform Medicine checks as though you’re using an advanced medkit. At 8th level, you can select a medical lab as one of your minor forms known.</p>"
