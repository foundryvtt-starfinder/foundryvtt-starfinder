If this transformation would increase your size to Large or larger and your reach is less than 10 feet, your reach becomes 10 feet. If your size decreases to Small or Medium, your reach decreases by 5 feet (minimum 5 feet). If your size becomes Tiny or smaller, you reach decreases by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet).</p>\n<p>The transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
