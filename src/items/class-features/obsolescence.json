This affects equipment in the following order, skipping any equipment that enemy does not have and randomly determining the target if the enemy has multiple items of the same type that qualify: item in hand, armor worn, active technological item, stowed weapon, any other item. As a full action, a creature can attempt a new Fortitude save to end the item’s broken condition, otherwise it remains broken for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. NPCs with armor broken by this effect take a –2 penalty to AC.</p>\n<p>Improved: Each enemy within 20 feet instead has two of their items malfunction, requiring a separate Fortitude save for each.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Il9nru6peE5H4tF2]{Obsolescence Finale (Su)}: When you use your mitigate ability to reduce damage you take from a weapon within 30 feet, you can cause that weapon to become incomprehensibly outdated until the end of the attacker’s next turn (Fortitude negates). An outdated weapon gains the archaic weapon special property and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. Once affected, a weapon becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>"
