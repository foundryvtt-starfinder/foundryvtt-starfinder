For a number of rounds equal to the expended spell slot’s level, you ignore non-magical difficult terrain and reduce all damage you take from non-magical hazards by an amount equal to your witchwarper level. If you enter an area of magical difficult terrain or magical hazardous terrain, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to attempt a dispel check against the magical terrain, as per dispel magic; if you succeed, you don’t dispel the effect but instead can move through and resist that terrain’s effects as though it were nonmagical for the duration of this paradigm shift.</p>"
