As a move action, you can spend 2 MP to shed light, causing light within 10 feet of you to increase by one step, up to a maximum of bright light. Each time a creature hits you with an unarmed strike or ends their turn adjacent to you, they take damage equal to your current MP. The damage dealt is of the same type that your adaptive strike deals. A creature can be damaged by this adaptation no more than once per round, no matter how many times they would trigger it. This aura lasts for 1 round. When this effect would end, you can extend the duration by 1 round by spending 1 MP, plus an additional MP for each previous round you have extended this effect. Once you use this adaptation, you can’t use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</p>"
