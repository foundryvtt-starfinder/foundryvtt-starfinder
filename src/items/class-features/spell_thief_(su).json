The maximum spell level of spells, spell-like abilities, and spell slots you can affect with this class feature equals 1 + one-third your operative level (to a maximum of 6th-level spells at 15th level).</p>\n<p>Your trick attack deals 1d3 additional damage at 1st level. This increases to 1d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d6 every 2 levels thereafter. Whenever you successfully use your trick attack to reduce a spell&rsquo;s duration or to steal spell energy from a target, the stolen energy empowers your next successful trick attack made in the next minute, increasing the die size of the trick attack&rsquo;s additional damage by two steps (to 1d6 at 1st level and to d10s at 3rd level and above).</p>\n<p>When you hit a target with your trick attack, you gain momentary awareness of whether the target is affected by at least one spell and whether they can cast spells (including spell-like abilities). When dealing your trick attack damage to a creature, you can drain some of the target&rsquo;s magic, halving the duration of one spell currently affecting the target. You can choose a specific spell to affect; otherwise, the can determine it randomly from among the beneficial spells affecting the target. You can reduce a given spell&rsquo;s duration only once, and the target can negate the reduction with a successful Will save.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, you can attempt to drain your target&rsquo;s spellcasting potential when you hit a target with your trick attack instead of reducing the duration of one of the target&rsquo;s spells. The target loses one spell slot of the highest spell level they can cast or a spell slot equal to one-third your operative level (whichever is lower), as if they had expended the slot. If the target has spell-like abilities, you can instead cause the creature to lose one daily use of their highest-level spell-like ability (maximum spell level equal to one-third your operative level). The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, when you reduce a spell&rsquo;s duration with your trick attack, you also can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to apply that spell&rsquo;s effect to yourself. This effect lasts for the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration or for a number of rounds equal to your Dexterity modifier, whichever is shorter. If you steal a second spell in this way, the first stolen spell&rsquo;s effects end immediately.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, when you apply a stolen spell&rsquo;s effect to yourself, the effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Dexterity modifier or for the spell&rsquo;s remaining duration, whichever is shorter. You can steal up to two spell effects at a time in this way; if you would steal a third effect, choose one of your current stolen spell effects to end immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>This alters trick attack and triple attack. It replaces debilitating trick, quad attack, and double debilitation.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Use this feature instead of the Trick Attack feature, when performing a Trick Attack.<br /></em><em>In the Modifiers tab, change the skill bonus to match your Specialization's skill check bonus.</em></p>"
