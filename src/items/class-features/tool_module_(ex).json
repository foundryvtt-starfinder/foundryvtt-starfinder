While you’re holding your experimental weapon prototype in at least one hand, you can use the installed item as if you were holding it. If the technological item and your experimental weapon prototype both use batteries of the same capacity, they can expend charges from each other’s batteries. The technological item remains joined to the weapon until you uninstall it with 10 minutes of work. You can’t have more than one item installed in your experimental weapon prototype at a time. You must have an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.9hIBsMSy3PmQzgus]{Experimental Weapon Prototype (Ex)} to select this mechanic trick.</p>"
