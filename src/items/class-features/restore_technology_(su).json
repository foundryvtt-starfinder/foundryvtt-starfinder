You must have access to an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Item.vvGynUbd3g4aOrbt]{Engineering Toolkit} and use this ability within 10 minutes of the object or construct’s demise. Doing so requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work. The revived target has 1 Hit Point, and any ability scores reduced to 0 are raised to 1. You repair all broken parts but can’t restore missing ones. A construct restored in this manner has a temporary negative level for 24 hours, and it returns with no Resolve Points, no Stamina Points, and no spell slots remaining. Restored objects become undamaged.</p>"
