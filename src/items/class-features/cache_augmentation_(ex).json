You might have been bestowed this augmentation by an order of technomancers, implanted the augmentation into yourself as part of your research, or witnessed part of your body undergo a technomantic apotheosis that left you with the ability to cast spells. Your cache augmentation takes the form of any cybernetic augmentation or magitech augmentation (Starfinder Armory 90) of your choice with an item level of 1. Each time you gain a level, the item level of your augmentation increases by 1, and you can replace it with a different augmentation with an item level equal to your technomancer level or lower. This augmentation counts toward the total number of augmentations you can have implanted into each of your body’s systems as normal.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, each time you regain your spells, choose one of the following: attack rolls, Computers and Engineering checks, Fortitude saves, or Reflex saves. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of your chosen type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 12th level and +3 at 18th level.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a second option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 18th level.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a third option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type.</p>\n<p>These enhancement bonuses count as part of the effects of your cache augmentation, and if your augmentation is removed or its effects suppressed (such as by the reject augmentation spell) you also lose these bonuses.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</strong></p>"
