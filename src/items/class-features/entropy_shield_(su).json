The shield has no bulk, but it otherwise functions in all regards as a physical shield of the selected type. You can dismiss the shield as part of any move or full action you take, and it disappears at the end of your turn if you are not holding it.<br><br>At 5th level, your compressed entropy functions as a field riot or tactical shield. At 10th level, it functions as an advanced riot or tactical shield. At 15th level, it functions as an elite riot or tactical shield, and at 20th level, it functions as a paragon riot or tactical shield.</span></p>",
