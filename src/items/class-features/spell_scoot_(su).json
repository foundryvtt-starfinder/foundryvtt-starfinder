This functions as the targeted dispel function ofdispel magicwith a range of 60 feet, using your envoy level as your caster level. Rather than dispelling the effect, if you succeed, you move the spell’s area of effect a distance that cannot exceed 5 feet × your Charisma modifier. This adjustment cannot change the effect’s orientation, and the movement is instantaneous, causing no incidental damage or disruption as it moves to its new location. Alternatively, you can use this improvisation to clear the spell’s effect for 1 round from a number of 5-foot cubes that does not exceed your Charisma modifier, such as to clear a path through awall of force.</p>\n<p>You must be 10th level to choose this improvisation.</p>"
