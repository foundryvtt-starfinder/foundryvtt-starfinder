This potential takes the form of a pool of Mutation Points (MP).</p><h3>Gaining MP</h3><p>Except where noted otherwise, you can gain Mutation Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Core Rulebook242). During combat, you gain 1 Mutation Point at the start of your turn. Once per turn, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain 1 Mutation Point. At the end of combat, you lose all Mutation Points. Other class features (such as evolution drain on page 13) provide additional ways to gain MP.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can have a maximum of 5 MP. This maximum increases by 1 at 7th level, 14th level, and 20th level.</p><h3>Maintaining MP</h3><p>As you gain Mutation Points your body and mind increasingly take on a supernatural character, such as exaggerated limbs, steely skin, luminescent eyes, or predatory drives. This gives you two beneficial instincts and one drawback; each of these provides an effect based on the number of MP you have, plus the cumulative effects of all lower MP values. Your drawback and one of your instincts are based on your niche (page 12). You also gain the following universal instinct.</p>\n<p><strong>1 MP:</strong> You gain a +5-foot enhancement bonus to one speed of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>2 MP:</strong> Your adaptive strike gains a critical hit effect based on its damage type: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#arc]{arc} (electricity), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#bind]{bind}(cold), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#bleed]{bleed} (piercing or slashing), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#burn]{burn} (fire), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#corrode]{corrode} (acid), or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj.JournalEntryPage.zOJ86MDq6kNzAAbB#knockdown]{knockdown} (bludgeoning). Critical hit effects that deal damage deal 1d6 damage; this damage increases to 1d10 at 7th level, 2d10 at 13th level, and 3d10 at 19th level.</p>\n<p><strong>3 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to speed increases to +10 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>4 MP:</strong> If you’re wearing light armor or no armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. If you’re wearing heavy or powered armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your EAC, though this can’t increase your EAC above your KAC.</p>\n<p><strong>5 MP:</strong> Once per round, when you deal damage with your adaptive strike, you can increase the damage dealt to one target by an amount equal to half your evolutionist level (minimum +1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>6 MP:</strong> You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>7 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to speed increases to +20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>8 MP:</strong> The enhancement bonus to your AC or EAC increases to +2.</p><h3>Spending MP</h3><p>Along with these standard ways you can spend Mutation Points, some evolutionist adaptations (page 13) add more.</p>\n<p><strong>1 MP:</strong> You can spend 1 MP on your turn to manifest your adaptive strike without taking an action.</p>\n<p><strong>2 MP:</strong> As a swift action, you can spend 2 MP to gain either a climb speed equal to half your land speed or a swim speed equal to half your land speed. This effect lasts 3 rounds. When you take a full action to charge, run, or withdraw, you can activate this ability without taking an action, rather than as a swift action.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Once per round, you can spend Mutation Points with no effect (which you might want to do to lose penalties, for example). If you use this ability as a move action, you can spend up to 2 MP. If you use this ability as a standard action, you can spend up to 4 MP. If you use this ability as a full action, you can spend up to 6 MP.</p>\n<p><em>Edit the value range as you level, in the Details tab.</em></p><em></em><p><em>Adjust Speed and Armor modifiers in the Modifiers tab to match selections.</em></p>"
