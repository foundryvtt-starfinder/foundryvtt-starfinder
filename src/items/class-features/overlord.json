You aren’t necessarily evil; perhaps you consider yourself a benevolent philosophermonarch who takes control for the good of your charges. You might also be a cult leader, a criminal mastermind, or a hypnotist.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.vIgmW8C54qgxPqUg]{Abadar}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.cO4BD8W8nUCLjvSE]{Besmara}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.pq08s1mZZyi97PBA]{Damoritosh}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.S7A3XE5trtBc0SH8]{Lao Shu Po}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.NCjMqGMqprKIe33d]{Zon-Kuthon}</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Diplomacy and Intimidate</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.PVzsrE1TxBBjDLCa]{Command}, 2nd -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.W0oa8tqHXAcWNaGT]{Hold Person}, 3rd -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.nmBeoZQUNcZw7nmy]{Suggestion}, 4th -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.wSeE9HyAmM7lTdpo]{@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.wSeE9HyAmM7lTdpo]{Confusion}}, 5th -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.J14mFZezYHIGHVhO]{Dominate Person}, 6th -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.gRv9eLrl4VCO825Z]{Suggestion, Mass}</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.OL0GoLmWqCnA5RDs]{Inexplicable Commands (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n <p>When one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities ends, the target loses all memory that it was magically controlled or influenced. That creature still remembers the actions it took, but may be confused by them.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.FKpmF3ZjYYTNUduI]{Forced Amity (Sp) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n <p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to shunt positive emotions and thoughts through your connection, forcing a humanoid creature to become friendly to you for a time. This functions as <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.3nFCrisRp2GIjbR3]{Charm Person}</em>.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.BYh0OPB4cT0cnrLD]{Echoes of Obedience (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n <p>Even creatures that resist your dominance can’t shake the lingering echoes of your mind. When a creature succeeds at a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities and negates the effect, it takes a –1 penalty to AC, attack rolls, and skill checks until the beginning of your next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.k4VPa3W093lKBReK]{Greater Forced Amity (Sp) - 9th Level}</h2>\n <p>Your forced amity ability functions as <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.SysRFlYml1f1Eofd]{Charm Monster}</em>.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.uB0u89YxPzefG6Dm]{Jealous Overlord (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n <p>When an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature is subject to mind-affecting effect that issues commands, as a reaction you can issue a countermand allowing the linked ally to act normally. When you do, attempt an opposed Charisma check against the originator of the mind-affecting effect; if you succeed, your ally can act normally.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.jVRkYFB5I4t31heR]{Forceful Commands (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n <p>When you use a mind-affecting charm or compulsion spell or spell-like ability against a target benefiting from an active spell that protects against your attack, you automatically become aware of the presence of such defenses, and can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of casting the spell to attempt a caster level check to dispel the highest-level such spell, as if you had cast <em>dispel magic</em>.</p>\n <h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.t7HitbsXGhRM6ryA]{Absolute Control (Su)} - 18th Level}</h2>\n <p>When you issue a command to a dominated creature that would force it to act against its nature, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to deny it a new saving throw against your domination. The dominated creature still won’t carry out an obviously self-destructive order.</p>"
