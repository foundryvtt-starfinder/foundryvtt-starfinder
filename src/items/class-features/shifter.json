This grants you extraordinary control over your own body—not with the goal of becoming something else, but of becoming everything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities:</strong> Accelsys<sup>GM</sup>, Flux<sup>GM</sup>, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.JournalEntry.yBvXrkYL2vAbRCS4]{Lamashtu}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.JournalEntry.FQYlHNdUxXmVccoI]{Oras}</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Skills:</strong> Athletics and Life Science</p>\n<p><strong>Spells:</strong> 1–6th @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.gNgdSyi4pXQmasmc]{Polymorph}<sup>AA2</sup>; replaced by 1st -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.HGg3fIQGDzUwueVa]{Disguise Self}, 2nd -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.jA6eTWFaULIpjXAx]{Spider Climb}, 3rd -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.xledsFeEKm5em0Dt]{Fluidity Of Form}<sup>GM</sup>, 4th -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.AHfzMTHx9PI4Z4zn]{Reincarnate}, 5th -@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.QyCBMgGxV5Z51rYh]{Mass Fluidity Of Form}<sup>GM</sup></p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.wjuvS6MPFT44F8gY]{Natural Weaponry (Ex) 1st Level}</h2><p>You naturally reshape your body into a variety of weapons. You gain a variant of the natural weapons universal creature rule. You can manifest or dismiss your natural weapon as easily as you would draw or sheathe a weapon. Each time you manifest your natural weapon, you choose its exact form and damage type—either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Its appearance is always overt and dangerous, such as bared claws, pronounced fangs, or the like.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you already have natural weapons that deal one of these damage types, you can instead enhance your existing natural weapon when activating this ability. This exaggerates the feature’s appearance slightly, and each time you hit a target with the unarmed strike, you can reroll one of its damage dice and use the higher result.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.hvMt48eD7j9Bh4oX]{Primal Defense (Ex) 3rd Level}</h2><p>When you cast a mystic spell, your body develops defensive features like scales, osteoderms, blubber, or fur until the beginning of your next turn. This grants you damage reduction against all kinetic damage, as well as energy resistance against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage until the beginning of your next turn. The value of the DR and energy resistance is equal to the spell’s level. You can spend 1 Resolve Point when you cast a mystic spell to increase the duration of this ability to 1 minute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.kj2D9dFvxlsW9Wya]{Healing Factor (Su) 6th Level}</h2><p>Your body responds spectacularly to healing, allowing you to recover faster. When you regain a randomly determined number of Hit Points or Stamina Points (such as from mystic cure, but not fast healing), increase either the Hit Points or Stamina Points you regain from that effect by 1 per die rolled. As a reaction, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to regain the maximum possible number of Hit Points or Stamina Points from the effect.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.jonnptuqGX76u5tK]{Master of Minor Forms (Ex) 9th Level}</h2><p>For every polymorph spell level except the highest spell level you can cast, each of your polymorph (Alien Archive 2 145) forms gains one additional special ability, chosen when you gain this ability. Each time you learn a higher-level version of polymorph, you add one extra special ability to each of the polymorph forms associated with your now second-highest spell level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.sTZNAjbkdDDoWQ1d]{Eternal Morph (Su) 12th Level}</h2><p>When you cast polymorph on yourself, you can spend a number of Resolve Points equal to half the spell’s level (rounded up) to increase the spell’s duration to 30 minutes per level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.JdsqtdWnv5ZVYcYv]{Sudden Transformation (Su) 15th Level}</h2><p>When you cast polymorph on yourself, you can decrease its casting time to 1 standard action. Once you do so, you cannot decrease its casting time again in this way until you spend 1 Resolve Point to recover Stamina Points while resting for 10 minutes.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.ZVe4NyxzCFR3ZS4J]{Titanic Transformation (Su) 18th Level}</h2><p>Once per day, you can transform yourself into a truly titanic creature by spending 2 Resolve Points when casting @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.gNgdSyi4pXQmasmc]{Polymorph} (Alien Archive 2 145) on yourself as a 6th-level spell, taking either a terrestrial or starfaring form. Once you leave either form, you cannot resume that form again until you rest to recover spell slots, even if using an ability like the Polymorph Adept (Alien Archive 2 145) feat.</p>\n<p>In your terrestrial form, you transform into a Colossal version of one of the 6th-level forms you know. This increases your space to 30 feet and increases your melee reach by 10 feet (minimum 20 feet, maximum 30 feet). Your form’s natural attacks each deal 6 additional damage; furthermore, the range of its special senses double, its enhancement bonus to Strength-based skill checks increases to +5, and you gain 30 temporary Hit Point that disappear when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>In your starfaring form, you transform into a living starship with the statistics presented below. You can choose your appearance and the weapons’ forms, but their statistics do not change. You can use your own gunnery modifier, skill check modifiers, and skill ranks in place of those provided by this form. When determining critical damage effects and conditions (Core Rulebook 321), use the critical damage effect table given as an example on page 128 of the Starship Operations Manual.</p>\n<p>You can’t carry passengers or install systems or upgrades while in your starfaring form.</p>\n<p>You retain this form for the duration of one starship encounter, and if you assume this form while aboard a friendly starship, you are immediately shunted outside of the starship to an adjacent hex of your choice. The spell ends if your starship form is disabled. When the spell ends, you gain 5 temporary negative levels, minus 1 temporary negative level for every 80 Hull Points you have &nbsp;remaining.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starships.Actor.s0OHg4GWSLspuL8r]{Living Starship}</p>"
