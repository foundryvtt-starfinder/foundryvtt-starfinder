When acting in the engineer or chief mate roles during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily boost your starship’s capabilities. Choose one of the following options. Any change lasts for 1 turn of starship combat per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous inventive engineer benefit ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Amplify Shields:</strong> You double the regeneration speed of your ship’s shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Angle Shields:</strong> Select one weapon arc of your starship. Any attack made against you from a starship in that arc takes a –1 penalty to the attack roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Countermeasures:</strong> Your starship’s TL increased by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Low Power Mode:</strong> You reduce the PCU cost of a specific system by 10 (minimum 5 PCU).</p>\n<p><strong>Speed Boost:</strong> You increase your ship’s speed by 2 hexes.</p>"
