Your imagination is powerful and perceptive, and you experience profound empathy toward others and their imaginings. You might influence dreams to aid and advise, or to manipulate and demoralize—the choice is yours.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.yBvXrkYL2vAbRCS4]{Lamashtu}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Item.ul7WYVhr1F6q32jN]{Nyarlathotep}</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Skills:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism (Wis; Trained Only)} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.nBrYkGfNBJAHe0xJ]{Sense Motive (Wis)}</p>\n<p><strong>Spells:</strong> 1st - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.33ppc6IfWm5ZwX9o]{Illusory Star Field}, 2nd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.ZsRv2Vcl2iamrcCt]{Song Of The Cosmos}, 3rd - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.Q6ca5NajAWAgZp5S]{Deep Slumber}, 4th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.NoIRRaiWVr8xxcJX]{Greater Song Of The Cosmos}, 5th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.0c25gVm7RKKg1nIy]{Contact Other Plane}, 6th - @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.Item.YnRDHb216HdROPeo]{Vision}</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.IdBt6heOyFRUGxTN]{Perceive Dreamspace (Su) - 1st Level}</h2><p>You can experience the dreams of sapient beings by entering a trance state and focusing on a particular dreamer or dream motif. You perceive this illusory dreamspace as a physical realm unique to each dreamer with whom you interact and explore with any senses you possess, though you can’t directly communicate with or affect the dreamer. Entering dreamspace is a full action. Once per day while inside dreamspace, you can spend 10 minutes concentrating on a single dreamer with whom you’re already familiar or a specific dream motif.</p>\n<p>If you observe a dreamer in dreamspace, the target must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + your class level [[10+@classes.mystic.levels]] to resist, causing you to learn nothing useful. Otherwise, you learn [[/r 1d4]] pieces of useful information about the dreamer at the GM’s discretion.</p>\n<p>If you observe a dream motif, you return to the waking world with the ability to create a physical manifestation of the motif as a standard action. This can mimic the effects of a 1st-level spell from any spell list. You must manifest the dream motif within 24 hours or until you next enter dreamspace (whichever comes first), or it’s lost.</p>\n<p>While inside dreamspace, you can’t perceive or interact with the physical world. Returning your consciousness fully to your physical body takes 1 minute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.tW2OSiS122amgWZa]{Dream Anchor (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2><p>Though you walk in imaginary realms, your bonds act as protective tethers to reality. You designate one willing ally or object with which you’re familiar as your dream anchor; once made, this choice can’t be changed for 24 hours. As long as your dream anchor is physically present and no more than 60 feet from your body while you’re inside dreamspace, you can use the anchor to return your consciousness to your body as a full action. In addition, your anchor can act as an alarm, alerting you if your physical body is in immediate danger, though it can’t communicate the nature of the threat to you.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.4Sfvo9sMJKXHItQL]{Dream Manifestation (Su) - 6th Level}</h2><p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to pull a concept or image from dreamspace and manifest it in the physical realm. This ability reproduces the effects of a spell of up to the highest level you can cast and can come from any spell list. You control the appearance of the dream manifestation.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.O7jG2sX6am0Pl1S9]{Fortified Imagination (Su) - 9th Level}</h2><p>You’ve experienced countless nightmares, preparing you to handle anything. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Will saves against mind-affecting spells and abilities. As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant this bonus to an ally who can perceive you.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.y6r1wbn3T0hAG4e0]{Dream Sending (Su) - 12th Level}</h2><p>Once per day while inside dreamspace, you can briefly communicate with creatures at great distances. This creature can be anywhere in the universe, including on another plane, as long as you’re familiar with them. You can speak freely with any ally linked by your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.ox6Am16XZqBXJNT9]{Telepathic Bond (Sp)} class feature when creating a dream sending. Creatures that aren’t linked to you by a telepathic bond can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 15 + one-half your class level [[15+floor(@classes.mystic.levels/2)]] to resist the dream sending. A creature can choose to fail this save. On a failure, the creature experiences a dream containing a brief message of 25 words or less the next time it rests. The message can be verbal or nonverbal, and you control the aesthetic, imagery, and events of this dream. The creature wakes remembering your message, though you can’t influence a creature’s actions or attitude toward you using this ability.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.FkLyMHbGPGwIsPJA]{Dream Blessing (Su) - 15th Level}</h2><p>Once per day, you can send a dream blessing to a creature with which you’re familiar. You control the aesthetic, imagery, and events of this dream. The creature experiences the dream when they next rest. For the next 24 hours, the creature benefits from a +2 bonus to a saving throw or skill check of your choice (this choice must be related to the dream’s subject matter) and can reroll a failed check of that type once per day</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.HqBLb5H1BN81uHuB]{Visitation (Su) - 18th Level}</h2><p>Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to physically travel to the location of a specific dreamer through dreamspace. The target dreamer can be anywhere in the universe, including on another plane, as long as you’re familiar with them. The visitation lasts for a number of minutes equal to one-half your character level.</p>"
