The maximum amount is equal to 1,000 credits per operative level you have (2,000 credits per level at 13th level, and 5,000 credits per level at 17th level). As a move action, you can produce any item with light or negligible bulk from your utility belt that does not have a price that exceeds the amount of credits currently deposited in the belt and that has an item level no greater than your operative level –2. This reduces the number of credits stored in the belt by a value equal to the item’s price. Once you have spent the credits deposited in the belt, you must spend 1d4 hours buying supplies in a typical settlement before you can use the utility belt again.</p>"
