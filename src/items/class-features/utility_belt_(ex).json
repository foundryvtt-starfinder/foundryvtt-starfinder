The maximum amount is equal to 1,000 credits per operative level you have (2,000 credits per level at 13th level, and 5,000 credits per level at 17th level). As a move action, you can produce any item with light or negligible bulk from your utility belt that does not have a price that exceeds the amount of credits currently deposited in the belt and that has an item level no greater than your operative level &ndash;2. This reduces the number of credits stored in the belt by a value equal to the item&rsquo;s price. Once you have spent the credits deposited in the belt, you must spend 1d4 hours buying supplies in a typical settlement before you can use the utility belt again.</p>"
