To use this ability, you must be adjacent to the body, or both you and the body must be adjacent to or within your cloud array. You end one of your current nanite arrays, channeling those nanites into the corpse, and use one nanite surge for each round (or fraction thereof) that the creature has been dead. This restores 5d8 Hit Points to the target and returns them to life, though in the process, the target gains a negative level for 24 hours. This ability canâ€™t resuscitate creatures slain by death effects, creatures turned into undead, or creatures whose bodies were destroyed, significantly mutilated, disintegrated, and so on.</p>"
