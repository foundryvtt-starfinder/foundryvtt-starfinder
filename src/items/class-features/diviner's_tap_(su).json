This takes 10 minutes and requires a successful Computers check against the device’s DC. If you fail, you can’t try again on the same device. On a success, your tap lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. You can program your tap either to give you general information about user activity on the device or to receive a mental alarm when a user accesses or transmits data about a specific topic (getting an idea of the information found). For instance, a user might hold a video call to talk about your exploits. If you chose to receive general information, you might know that a video call took place but not the call’s topic. If you chose to have the tap receive an alarm when the topic is you, you’d get the gist of the conversation (but not a complete transcript). Setting up a new diviner’s tap ends the duration of any previous one still in effect.</span></p>",
