For the duration, you canâ€™t be moved by any nonmagical effect and are immune to cold damage. In addition, during this time, any creature that touches you, hits you with a melee attack with a natural weapon, or starts their turn within 20 feet of you takes 3d6 cold damage per Entropy Point spent. Any creature that takes this damage is affected as though by <em>slow</em> (no save) until the damage is healed. You can dismiss this effect at the end of your turn without taking an action.<br><br>Activating absolute zero automatically ends any living effigy discipline you have active.</span></p>",
