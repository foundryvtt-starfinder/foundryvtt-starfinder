This lasts until you end it as a swift action, take damage that causes you to lose Hit Points, or fail a Will saving throw. While in your silent state, you gain no benefits from the aid another, covering fire, and harrying fire actions, and you take a –2 penalty to attacks and checks to perform these actions. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion, fear, mind-affecting, pain, sense-dependent, and sonic effects, increasing to +3 at 9th level and +4 at 15th level. When your silent state ends, you receive a burst of insight, and can apply the insight bonus granted by the channel skill class ability (+1 at 1st level) to the next skill check you attempt before the end of your next turn.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.KTZoGtATgR6jVBq7]{Focused Detachment (Ex) 3rd Level}</h2><p>While in your silent state, you gain two additional benefits thanks to your enhanced focus. First, if you would fail to cast or sustain a spell due to harsh conditions, damage taken, or similar effects, you have a 50% chance (or a 100% chance if you end your silent state as a reaction) to cast or concentrate on the spell normally; this does not negate any damage you take from the effect.</p>\n<p>Second, if stress or other conditions would prevent you from taking 10 on a skill check, you can attempt a special DC 10 check (1d20 + any insight bonus you apply to that skill). If you succeed, you can take 10 regardless of the distractions for 1 minute or until your silent state ends, whichever comes first. If you fail, you gain no benefit and can’t attempt to ignore distractions to your skill checks again for 1 minute. At 9th level, you automatically succeed at this check to take 10 on Mysticism and Stealth checks.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.dLR3xUASG0E4COhS]{Strength in Silence (Ex) 6th Level}</h2><p>As you detach from reality, you ignore some of its limitations and threats. When you enter your silent state, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to your mystic level. These last until your silent state ends. While in your silent state, if your Wisdom modifier is at least 2 higher than the ability score modifier you apply to an attack roll, you gain a +1 insight bonus to the attack roll. Finally, while in your silent state, creatures take a –1 penalty to initial saving throws against your mystic spells when those creatures are not within melee reach of any of their allies; this does not apply to spells of the highest spell level that you can cast.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.siqip7z3Y5hx6Pc0]{Meditative Purge (Su) 9th Level}</h2><p>You can channel a burst of the multiverse’s healing power, though doing so shatters your focus. You can end your silent state as a standard action to gain the effects of either lesser restoration or remove condition. If the condition you would remove limits the actions you can take per round, you can instead spend all the actions you do receive that turn to activate this ability at the end of your turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 13th level and 17th level. At 15th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point when activating this ability to instead gain the effects of restoration and can spend additional RP as necessary to remove a negative level.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.675UO3T3bCjQSSH5]{Moment of Silence (Ex) 12th Level}</h2><p>When you are not in your silent state but end your turn while not within the melee reach of any other creature, you can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 20 + 1/2 your character level). If you succeed, you enter your silent state at the end of your turn. Once you enter your silent state using this ability, you cannot do so again for 1 minute.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.fxGkqhzocUnprpfE]{Isolating Strike (Su) 15th Level}</h2><p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to banish a creature within 30 feet to a tiny, peaceful demiplane (Will negates) for 2d6 rounds. The demiplane is supernaturally peaceful, granting the target fast healing 5 and suppressing any compulsion, fear, or pain effects currently affecting the target. At the beginning of each of their turns, the target can attempt to escape the demiplane with a successful Will save. Once the effect ends or the target escapes, they reappear 1d4×5 feet away from their original location in a randomly determined direction (Core Rulebook page 245), appearing in the nearest space that can support them if that one is occupied.</p>\n<p>Once you target a creature with this ability, they become immune to subsequent uses for 24 hours. You cannot use this ability a second time while your first target remains trapped.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.q7y1tVpj71Cq01dh]{Beyond the Body (Su) 18th Level}</h2><p>As long as you are in your silent state at the beginning of your turn, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to become incorporeal until the beginning of your next turn. Alternatively, if you concentrate for 1 round without spending other actions, you can spend 1 Resolve Point at the beginning of your next turn to become incorporeal for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can end this incorporeal state as a swift action.</p>"
