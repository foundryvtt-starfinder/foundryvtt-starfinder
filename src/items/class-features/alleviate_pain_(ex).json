When injected, the mixture provides the target with a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against pain effects and effects that cause the sickened or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated} condition. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the target is already under one of these effects, or if it already has the sickened or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated} condition, it can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 enhancement bonus to end the effect or remove the condition. This does not grant a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one. If you are at least 7th level, the bonus to saving throws against pain effects and effects that cause the sickened or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated} condition increases to +6, or +4 for targets already afflicted and attempting a new saving throw. If you are at least 13th level, this automatically removes the sickened condition, and the bonus to new saving throws for the other conditions increases to +6.</p>"
