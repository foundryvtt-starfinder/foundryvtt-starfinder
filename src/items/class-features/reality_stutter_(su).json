You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn’t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can’t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.<br><br>Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.</p>",
