This doesn’t allow you to attack a creature with total cover.</p>\n<p>When you use your seeking strike with a weapon you formed with your gear array to make a ranged attack that targets a creature or creates a line, you can use one or more nanite surges to alter the attack’s path to avoid obstacles and allies. Up to a distance equal to the weapon’s first range increment, you can trace out any path for the attack that doesn’t turn more than 90 degrees per 5 feet traveled, potentially allowing the attack to avoid cover or total cover. Using this ability requires you to use one nanite surge for every two times your attack changes direction, rounded up.</p>"
