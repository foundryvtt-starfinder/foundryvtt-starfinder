For each Resolve Point spent, you cause one willing creature you touch while casting the spell to also gain the effects of that spell for 1 hour. Each junk armament created with the spell requires its own supply of junk to transform. The creature uses your technomancer level to calculate the spell’s effects, though the creature’s junk armament does not gain any additional abilities granted by your class abilities (such as the additional armor upgrade slot granted by junk technomancy). For junk armor, you can choose for each target whether to create light armor or temporarily turn the target’s light armor into heavy armor. For junksword, each weapon you create has identical statistics, such as which special properties it has and whether it is analog or powered.</p>"
