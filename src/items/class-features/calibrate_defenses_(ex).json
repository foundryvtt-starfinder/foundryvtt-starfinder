As a move action, you analyze the weapons and attack patterns of one enemy you can see, programming your armor prototype with this information to improve your ability to defend against that enemy. You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC against the next attack from that opponent, as long as it occurs before the end of your next turn. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and to +3 at 16th level. Calibrating your defenses against another enemy causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous enemyâ€™s attacks.</p>"
