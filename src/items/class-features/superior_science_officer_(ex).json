When acting in the science officer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily enhance your starship’s computer. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous superior science officer option ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Sensors:</strong> Your scan actions reveal an additional piece of information about the starship being scanned. For instance, if your Computers skill check to scan a starship succeeds by 5 or more, you learn two pieces of information instead of one.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Sensors:</strong> When you perform a scan action, you can choose which information category to learn information about, regardless of the normal order of information you would learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgrade Node:</strong> You divert additional power to your starship’s computer, granting the computer’s bonus to one additional starship combat check per round.</p>"
