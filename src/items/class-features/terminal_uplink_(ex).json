As a full action, you can upload your exocortex into a computer to which you have root access, directing it to monitor that computer. Once your exocortex is integrated, your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.uWZ3LvxQ3yezLB4j]{Custom Rig (Ex)} alerts you whenever a creature operates or attempts to hack the computer, similar to the alarm countermeasure. Your exocortex upload can be removed from the computer by other users as if it were a module. If you upload your exocortex into a different computer, you lose the benefits of terminal uplink with the first computer, and the exocortex upload on that computer deletes itself [[/r 1d10]]{1d10 (Terminal Uplink)} minutes later.</p>\n<p>If you upload your exocortex into a computer with a camera, microphone, or other similar monitoring device, you can perceive the computer’s surroundings with that hardware by using your custom rig, so long as you’re within 100 feet per [[@classes.mechanic.levels]]{mechanic level} you have of the computer. While observing the computer’s surroundings in this way, you can’t use your exocortex’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.yeAW67ho3SsxqJNR]{Memory Module (Ex)}, and the number of targets you can track with your exocortex is reduced by one. You must have an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cM54UpNXExgDSbq4]{Exocortex} to select this mechanic trick.</p>"
