As a full action, you can upload your exocortex into a computer to which you have root access, directing it to monitor that computer. Once your exocortex is integrated, your @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.uWZ3LvxQ3yezLB4j]{Custom Rig (Ex)} alerts you whenever a creature operates or attempts to hack the computer, similar to the alarm countermeasure. Your exocortex upload can be removed from the computer by other users as if it were a module. If you upload your exocortex into a different computer, you lose the benefits of terminal uplink with the first computer, and the exocortex upload on that computer deletes itself 1d10 minutes later.</p>\n<p>If you upload your exocortex into a computer with a camera, microphone, or other similar monitoring device, you can perceive the computer&rsquo;s surroundings with that hardware by using your custom rig, so long as you&rsquo;re within 100 feet per mechanic level you have of the computer. While observing the computer&rsquo;s surroundings in this way, you can&rsquo;t use your exocortex&rsquo;s memory module, and the number of targets you can track with your exocortex is reduced by one. You must have an @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.cM54UpNXExgDSbq4]{Exocortex} to select this mechanic trick.</p>"
