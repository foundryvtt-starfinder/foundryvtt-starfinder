It gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.dXoXgaKcx2ZfBD4M.JournalEntryPage.UajK3gQtuf1CMz2y]{Autopilot} function with a Piloting bonus equal to 4 + 1-1/2 × the mech’s tier. You can use your custom rig to control the autopilot at a range of 5 miles, allowing you to engage, disengage, or enter coordinates for the autopilot as if you were in the mech. This range increases to 50 miles if you have the expert rig ability, 500 miles if you have the advanced rig ability, and has a planetary range if you have the superior rig ability. At 10th level, this ability only allows movement of the mech. At 14th you can spend 1 Resolve Point to remotely operate all systems onboard the mech as if you were in it, and at 18th level the range at which you can remotely operate all systems of the mech doubles.</p>\n<p><em>Edit the range manually based on which rig you have.</em></p>"
