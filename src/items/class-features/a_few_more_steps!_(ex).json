The ally remains conscious, becomes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{nauseated}, and gains temporary Hit Points equal to [[@classes.envoy.levels+@abilities.cha.mod]]{your envoy level + your Charisma modifier} until the end of their next turn. Afterward, if the ally has 0 Hit Points, they become unconscious and dying as normal, including losing 1 Resolve Point at the end of their turn. Once a creature has been affected by this improvisation, they’re immune to it for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, the ally becomes @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{staggered} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{off-target} rather than nauseated.
