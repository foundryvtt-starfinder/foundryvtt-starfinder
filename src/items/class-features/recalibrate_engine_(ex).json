The vehicle gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its speed and a +50 feet (+5 mph) enhancement bonus to its full speed (to a maximum of double) and its Piloting modifier is reduced by 2. You can also penalize its speed to increase its piloting modifier.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat you use the recalibrate engine ability in place of any other engineering action. The ship gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its speed for 1 turn, and the Piloting check made in the Helm phase to determine the order of movement of starships gains a +2 enhancement bonus, but all other Piloting checks made that turn take a –5 penalty.</p>"
