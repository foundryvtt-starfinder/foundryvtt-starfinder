The target must either be adjacent to you or be adjacent to or within your nanite cloud. Alternatively, you can target yourself with this ability. For 1 minute, or until the target begins their turn no longer adjacent to you or adjacent to or within your cloud array, the target gains fast healing 1 (as per the universal creature rule), except that the ability restores Stamina Points instead of Hit Points. Whenever the target regains a Stamina Point from this ability, they also gain 1 temporary Hit Point that stacks with temporary Hit Points gained from this ability, but not with other temporary Hit Points. When the effect ends, the target loses any temporary Hit Points gained from this ability. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the fast healing increases by 1, and the temporary Hit Points increase by 2.</p>",
