While in your bonded biome, you gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative checks and a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws to resist hazards.

When you travel overland in your bonded biome, you treat trackless terrain as though it had a road for the purpose of determining overland movement speed for you, any vehicle you pilot, and up to 10 allies within 60 feet of you. Once per day while in your bonded biome, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.PecEOjojT15BJKi9]{Haste} as a spell-like ability, using your mystic level as your caster level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.1jqwc4ligwWHVdVG]{Channel Biome (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>While in your bonded biome, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to channel the biome into a violent blast in a 20-foot-radius burst with a range of 100 feet, dealing 1d6 damage per mystic level (Reflex half).</p>\n<p>The damage type or types are based on your biome: airborne: bludgeoning; aquatic: cold and piercing; arctic: cold and sonic; desert: slashing and fire; forest: slashing; marsh: acid; mountain: sonic; other: piercing, acid, or electricity; plains: electricity; space: cold or force; subterranean: acid and bludgeoning; urban: piercing and sonic; weird: force.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.9Fyg63QmS8MkdmOq]{Biome Sense (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>While in your bonded biome, you gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#blindsense]{Blindsense} (vibration) with a range of 30 feet, creatures gain no bonuses when flanking you, and you take no penalties to Perception checks for being asleep.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oSZTCqlFQTlG5NN3]{One with the Universe (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can bond with a biome automatically upon entering it, and you can maintain a connection to two bonded biomes at once (although you must still encounter them to do so).
