While in your bonded biome, you gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative checks and a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws to resist hazards. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.dIlKtUGGKcur6OaK]{Wisp Ally} as a spell-like ability while in your bonded biome, using your mystic level as your caster level.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.h7orLPlkfEnvBTL5]{Navigation Insight (Ex) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>When using Piloting to navigate or astrogate a course, you treat unfamiliar locations as seldom visited locations and seldom visited locations as frequently visited locations when calculating the DC.

When you attempt a saving throw against a hazard in your bonded biome, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to roll the saving throw twice and take the better result.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ei2pA3ymGpnQi4MK]{Swift Travels (Ex) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>For every 10 points by which you exceed the Piloting check DC to navigate or astrogate, you can reroll one of the dice used to determine travel time to your destination and use the lower of the two results. When you travel overland in your bonded biome, you treat trackless terrain as though it had a road for the purpose of determining overland movement speed for you, any vehicle you pilot, and up to 10 allies within 60 feet of you. Once per day while in your bonded biome, you can cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.PecEOjojT15BJKi9]{Haste} as a spell-like ability, using your mystic level as your caster level.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.1jqwc4ligwWHVdVG]{Channel Biome (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>While in your bonded biome, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to channel the biome into a violent blast in a 20-foot-radius burst with a range of 100 feet, dealing 1d6 damage per mystic level (Reflex half).</p>\n<p>The damage type or types are based on your biome: airborne: bludgeoning; aquatic: cold and piercing; arctic: cold and sonic; desert: slashing and fire; forest: slashing; marsh: acid; mountain: sonic; other: piercing, acid, or electricity; plains: electricity; space: cold or force; subterranean: acid and bludgeoning; urban: piercing and sonic; weird: force.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.9Fyg63QmS8MkdmOq]{Biome Sense (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>While in your bonded biome, you gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#blindsense]{Blindsense} (vibration) with a range of 30 feet, creatures gain no bonuses when flanking you, and you take no penalties to Perception checks for being asleep.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.oSZTCqlFQTlG5NN3]{One with the Universe (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can bond with a biome automatically upon entering it, and you can maintain a connection to two bonded biomes at once (although you must still encounter them to do so). You don&rsquo;t require food or water for sustenance, and you automatically succeed at Survival checks to avoid getting lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
