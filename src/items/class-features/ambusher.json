You must have Stealth as a class skill to select this fighting style.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ofex4GEQYNeuyLFu]{Vigilance (Ex) (1st)}</h2>\n<p>You watch for danger and respond swiftly. You gain Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Whenever you act before an enemy during the first round of combat, you gain a +1 insight bonus to weapon attack rolls against that enemy until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.9bSlBo3by4b0uggU]{Cheap Shot (Ex) (2nd)}</h2>\n<p>When you succeed at a Stealth check to hide opposed by a target’s Perception check or when you have improved or total cover against a target, as a full action you can make one ranged attack against that target that deals additional damage equal to half your Dexterity bonus.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Z2gmZVegIj3rrQU6]{Deadly Reflexes (Ex) (3rd)}</h2>\n<p>When an enemy attacks you before you have taken any actions in combat, you can use your quick reflexes to retaliate. As a reaction, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make one attack with a ranged weapon you are wielding immediately after the enemy’s attack.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.AXtKH0hF7pgeRmDX]{Exploit Cover (Ex) (4th)}</h2>\n<p>When you attempt a Stealth check to hide from an enemy that can see you, you gain a +4 insight bonus to the check if you can move into improved or total cover. In addition, whenever you attempt a Stealth check to hide while sniping, the penalty to your Stealth check is only –10.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.A8J3W76IufDmKbqk]{Ambusher’s Edge (Ex) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>As a full action, you can make one attack that, in addition to dealing its normal damage and effects, causes the target to gain the off-target condition until the end of its next turn. You can also use this ability as a standard action against any creature that is flat-footed.</p>"
