While your sheath array is active, you can use the Disguise skill to change your appearance with 1d3 minutes of work; you can use one nanite surge to reduce this required time to a full action. You reduce one of the check’s DC modifiers by an amount equal to half your nanocyte level (to a minimum of +0), though this reduction applies only to disguises that change your appearance in the following ways: add major features, disguise yourself as a different race of the same creature type, or disguise yourself as a different creature type.</p>\n<p>You must have the versatile nanites knack and have selected Disguise as one of the affected skills to select this knack.</p>"
