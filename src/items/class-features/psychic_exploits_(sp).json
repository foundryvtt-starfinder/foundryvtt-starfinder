You can use your psychic exploits twice per day, though you regain one daily use each time you regain Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest. Your psychic exploits can detect or affect only creatures you can sense with your mental awareness. Any spell-like abilities use your envoy level as their caster level and your Charisma score to calculate saving throw DCs.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you can expend a psychic exploit to cast detect thoughts, mental silence, or mindlink as a spell-like ability. At 9th level, you can expend a psychic exploit when activating your psychic resilience ability to apply the latter’s bonus to a Will saving throw to a number of allies equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). At 13th level, you can expend a psychic exploit and 2 Resolve Points to cast discern lies, mind probe, or modify memory as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, you can expend a psychic exploit to gain blindsight (thought) with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes.</p>"
