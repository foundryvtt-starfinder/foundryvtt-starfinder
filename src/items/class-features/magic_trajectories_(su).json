You can do this to a weapon in your possession or one held by an ally that is within reach at the time you use this ability. Each time an attack is made with the weapon, the attacker can exclude targets they are aware of. This exclusion applies only to instant effects and critical hit effects, such as damage or bleed, not lingering secondary effects such as creating a cloud of smoke.<br>After you use this ability, you cannot do so again until after you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</span></p>",
