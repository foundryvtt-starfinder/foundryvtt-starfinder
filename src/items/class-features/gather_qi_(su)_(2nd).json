Each time you use gather qi, you spend 1 Resolve Point and choose one of the following qi powers. You gain that qi power until you rest for 8 hours or you use gather qi again to swap benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Extreme Speed:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Plasma Blast:</strong>&nbsp;You condense your body’s qi into a beam of superheated plasma, allowing you to make a special ranged unarmed strike that targets KAC, requires one hand, is not archaic, has a range increment of 30 feet, deals lethal electricity and fire damage, and has the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} critical hit effect. For the duration of this ability, you gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat that adds 1-1/2 times your level to the damage of this unarmed strike (rather than adding your level).</p>\n<p><strong>Qi Flight:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a fly speed equal to your base speed with average maneuverability. At the end of each turn, if you are not on ground able to support you, you fall. If you already have a fly speed, it increases by 10 feet instead.</p>"
