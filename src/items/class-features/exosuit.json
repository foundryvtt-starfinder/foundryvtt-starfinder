      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oKlwvc1HcIsg7Q7a]{Fighting Style}</p>\n<p>You thrive not when wearing armor, but when piloting it. For you, a mech<sup>TR</sup> is like a second skin, and you’re able to push your favorite mech to its limits.</p>\n<p>Mechs do not feature in every Starfinder campaign, so it’s important to check with your GM before selecting this fighting style to understand how regularly you might apply its benefits.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.n6f15dHdn5P6DDjX]{The Only Mech for Me (Ex) 1st Level}</h2><p>Once per day, you’re able to develop a special bond with a mech by performing maintenance, testing maneuvers, running diagnostics, and appreciating its grandeur for 8 hours over a 24-hour period; you can spend 1 or more Resolve Points to reduce the time needed to form this bond by 1d4 hours per RP spent, to a minimum of a full action to form the bond. If you bond with a different mech, your previous bond ends.</p>\n<p>You gain a +1 insight bonus to Piloting checks, which increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter (maximum +6 at 19th level). This insight bonus applies to all your skills for the purpose of performing the maneuver Power Point ability. Finally, you can enter an allied or unattended mech as a standard action, or exit a mech as a standard action (rather than as a full action).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.KrYhbXlOgWOtdozG]{Intuitive Commands (Ex) 5th Level}</h2><p>When you operate your bonded mech to grant it an additional move action or standard action, you can grant the mech a special benefit depending on the type of action you performed with the mech. If you used the action to move, you grant the mech a +1 enhancement bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. If you used the action to make one or more attacks, you can reduce the Power Point cost of the devastating hit ability or the called shot ability by 1 (minimum 2 PP). Once you use intuitive commands, you cannot do so again for 1d4 rounds. At 15th level, this is reduced to 1d4–1 rounds.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.ArJran2V5ig1qqKJ]{Unstoppable Together 9th Level}</h2><p>Your bonded mech won’t quit until you do, granting you three benefits. When you operate your bonded mech to grant it an additional move action or standard action, you halve any penalties caused by malfunctioning systems you use to complete that mech action; if you use the action to move, you also ignore any speed penalty caused by malfunctioning lower limbs for that action.</p>\n<p>Once per minute as a reaction, while you are operating your bonded mech and it would take enough damage to experience system failure, you can split the damage taken (after applying the mech’s hardness) between you and the mech.</p>\n<p>Once per day, you can either reduce the PP your bonded mech spends to ignore a system’s malfunctioning condition to 0 PP, or you can reduce the PP cost of it treating a system’s inoperable condition as malfunctioning to 2 PP.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.ofnFoku234lKsrFj]{Titan’s Onslaught (Ex) 13th Level}</h2><p>When you operate your bonded mech, use its additional granted action to perform a full attack, and use the aim Power Point ability, you apply part of the enhanced aim to all the attacks. Apply the full insight bonus to the first attack roll; reduce the bonus by 1 (minimum 0) and apply it to the second attack; and reduce the bonus by 2 (minimum 0) and apply it to any additional attacks made as part of the full attack. Additionally, when you use the additional action you grant to the mech to make a full attack, you can apply your soldier’s onslaught class ability to the full attack, making three attacks with a –6 penalty to each attack.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your kill shot class ability with mech weapon attacks you make.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.q30y2FG5lOrDGeMY]{Alpha Strike (Ex) 17th Level}</h2><p>Once per day when you operate your bonded mech, you can grant the mech both a move action and a standard action. If you use these to perform a full attack, you can make one attack with each of the mech’s weapons, to a maximum of four attacks. If you make three or four attacks in this way, make each attack with a –6 penalty instead of a –4 penalty. These attacks ignore and are not counted against the mech’s limit of activating its weapons more than once per round. Finally, if any of these attacks damage the same target, you can combine those attacks’ damage for the purpose of overcoming energy resistance and damage reduction.</p>"
