When you use your combat tracking exocortex ability to track a creature, as a swift action, you can grant an ally the ability to make attacks against that target as if their base attack bonus were equal to your mechanic level. If you do, attacks you make against that target use your normal attack bonus. To benefit from this ability, the ally must be within 30 feet and have an active comm unit (such as those installed in most armor) or have a cybernetic or magitech eye(s) augmentation; if the ally has both a comm unit and applicable augmentation, you can broadcast to that ally at a range of 60 feet. When you use this trick, exocortex abilities that increase the number of targets you can track with combat tracking instead increase the number of targets that your ally can track.</p>\n<p>This ability lasts until you end it with a swift action, you become unconscious, you can no longer perceive the target, or the ally moves beyond this trickâ€™s range. You must have an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cM54UpNXExgDSbq4]{Exocortex} to select this mechanic trick.</p>"
