The target creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or it instead loses its action immediately as it is shocked into stillness, and it cannot voluntarily take any additional movement until the beginning of its next turn. Once an attacker has been affected by this paradigm shift, it canâ€™t be targeted by it again for 24 hours. This is a fear effect.</span></p>",
