You might be a brilliant astronomer, a daredevil starpilot, a Drift explorer, a prophetic astrologer, or a would-be transhuman godling.<br><br><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Desna, Ibra, Nyarlathotep, Sarenrae, The Devourer, Triune<br><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Perception and Piloting<br><strong>Spells</strong>: 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.jUTs9R52bL7SuHwY]{Magic Missile*}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.XZ1X1IzN0tckzOPn]{Darkvision}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.vOQ1NkfDHafdqTfE]{Irradiate*}, 4th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.ANDdDHLnY7Dfnhtq]{Remove Radioactivity*}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.lrMTBRwONgY1cdWy]{Telekinesis*}, 6th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.GXYWlBuSrRRoLogX]{Control Gravity}<br><br></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.esO8OIyMUvm1hleR]{Walk the Void (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>You are immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and vacuum. You also gain a fly speed of 20 feet while in space. In addition, whenever you can see the stars, you can determine your precise location. Finally, add Piloting to your list of class skills.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.MWtwqHTVoDiINijS]{Starlight Form (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>You can transform yourself into blazing starlight as a standard action. Your body sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius, and you gain the benefits of concealment (20% miss chance). At 7th level, a creature that ends its turn adjacent to your starlight form must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. You can maintain your starlight form for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level; this duration does not need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can forgo the ability's concealment and blinding aspects to instead simply shed light, though this still counts against the ability’s duration for the day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.zPIwjVyye1NQjNfS]{Stargazer (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can study the stars to gain a bit of good luck. Twice per day, if you are outdoors and can see the stars, you can reroll a failed ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check (see page 243).</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.wukzJFpiLX52C5Kv]{Starflight (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>While in starlight form, you gain the ability to fly as per the <em>flight</em> spell (spell level 3rd or lower).</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.si5PQwymkJvETDOA]{Starry Bond (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can share the good fortune of your stargazer class feature with your allies. Whenever an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature fails an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to enable your ally to reroll the failed check (see page 243). This ability otherwise functions as the stargazer class feature.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2UygdDVj7fppzMGm]{Meteor Shower (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to call down a rain of meteorites in a 10-foot-radius vertical cylinder, 40 feet high, at a range of up to 250 feet. The meteorites deal 12d6 damage to every creature in the area (Reflex half). Half the damage is bludgeoning damage; the other half is fire damage. If you are outdoors and can see stars, the meteorites instead deal 12d10 damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.6xnrycJGJ6gYcl4p]{Interplanetary Teleport (Sp) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to use <em>interplanetary teleport</em> as a spell-like ability. If you have been to a location in another star system before, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to use <em>interplanetary teleport</em> to travel there, even though it exceeds the spell’s normal range.</p>",
