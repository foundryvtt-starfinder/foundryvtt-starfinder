You perceive this illusory dreamspace as a physical realm unique to each dreamer with whom you interact and explore with any senses you possess, though you can’t directly communicate with or affect the dreamer. Entering dreamspace is a full action. Once per day while inside dreamspace, you can spend 10 minutes concentrating on a single dreamer with whom you’re already familiar or a specific dream motif.</p>\n<p>If you observe a dreamer in dreamspace, the target must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + your class level [[10+@classes.mystic.levels]] to resist, causing you to learn nothing useful. Otherwise, you learn [[/r 1d4]] pieces of useful information about the dreamer at the GM’s discretion.</p>\n<p>If you observe a dream motif, you return to the waking world with the ability to create a physical manifestation of the motif as a standard action. This can mimic the effects of a 1st-level spell from any spell list. You must manifest the dream motif within 24 hours or until you next enter dreamspace (whichever comes first), or it’s lost.</p>\n<p>While inside dreamspace, you can’t perceive or interact with the physical world. Returning your consciousness fully to your physical body takes 1 minute.</p>"
