As a standard action before the end of your next turn, you can make one attack against the condemned creature, gaining benefits based on the number of linked allies who have damaged the condemned creature since you activated this ability.</span></p>\n<p><span>You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to hit if at least one linked ally damaged the target, and this increases to +3 if all linked allies damaged them. Your attack deals an additional 1d12 untyped damage for each ally who damaged the target (maximum 5d12 damage). For each ally who damaged the target, you reduce any miss chance affecting the target by 10% (minimum 0% miss chance). Finally, you can choose for your attack to gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Nrf6oy9pJwcEmryP.JournalEntryPage.nXkFsyxk7Vybdn7G#nonlethal]{Nonlethal} weapon special property. After you affect a creature with this ability, they become immune to further uses for 24 hours.</span></p>"
