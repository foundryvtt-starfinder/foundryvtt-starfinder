Choose two 0-level technomancer spells, two 1st-level technomancer spells, and one 2nd-level technomancer spell. You incorporate spell gems for these spells into your apparatus at no cost. You gain a limited version of the technomancer’s spells class feature, though you can use these spells only while wielding the apparatus, and your selection of spells is limited to those spells embedded in the apparatus. You have one 1st-level spell slot and one 2nd-level spell slot, and you can cast the 0-level spells at will. You gain one 3rd-level spell slot at 13th level, and you gain one 4th-level spell slot at 16th level. Casting these spells does not expend the incorporated spell gems. Your experimental apparatus can store a maximum number of spell gems equal to half your mechanic level, and these spell gems can be of any level. You can incorporate and replace spell gems in the apparatus as you would new magic items, and incorporated spell gems are effectively destroyed once installed.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you would gain a new mechanic trick, you can instead increase the number of spell gems the apparatus can hold by one, as well as gain one additional spell slot of your maximum spellcasting level, to a maximum of four spells per level.</p>"
