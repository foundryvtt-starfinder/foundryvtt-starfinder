These penalties do not stack, but you can apply different penalties to a single target with multiple hits. The effect lasts until you apply one of these effects to a new target or until the end of your next turn. If you successfully damage a target that has one of these penalties, the penalty’s duration is extended until the end of your next turn.</p>"
