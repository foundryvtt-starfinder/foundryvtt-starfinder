You gain Antagonize as a bonus feat. You do not need to meet its prerequisites. This is not a language-dependent ability for you, but it does not work on mindless targets. If you are at least 6th level, when you successfully use Antagonize on a foe, the duration of the penalty the foe takes is 3 rounds longer than usual (though it still ends after the foe attacks you, forces you to attempt a saving throw, or damages you), and the target takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls (in addition to the normal –2 for being off-target).</span></p>",
