You temporarily boost a creature with a sudden surge of vitality, granting it temporary Hit Points equal to your level. At the end of the duration of this booster, the creature recovers Hit Points equal to any remaining temporary Hit Points from this booster. At 10th level, the amount of temporary Hit Points granted is equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor:</strong> You deliver a rapidly spreading fungal infection to a creature, reducing any healing it receives by half and reducing its speed by 5 feet. The targeted creature must also succeed at a Fortitude save or also take a –1 penalty to melee attacks. Once a creature has resisted the effects of a hypermycologist’s inhibitor, they are immune to its effects for 24 hours.</p><h3>Breakthrough</h3><p>You can use the following ability when you achieve the breakthrough for this field of study.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.Hnt13bHfBsqWgh3B]{Sudden Growth (Ex)}:</strong> As a standard action, you can create and deliver a potent fungal infection to a creature. When injected, the formula develops in one of three patterns: visual, mental, or physical, chosen as part of your standard action. Targets can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effects.</p><ul><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.effects.Item.bOjsZFLklGr5hRb4]{Visual}:</strong> The targeted creature is silhouetted by a sudden growth of mushrooms. These mushrooms hinder the subject’s perception, causing a –2 penalty to Perception checks and negating invisibility for 1 minute.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental:</strong> The targeted creature is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{confused} until the end of your next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical:</strong> The targeted creature is surrounded in a surfeit of gigantic mushrooms that spring up around them, creating an impassible wall in any empty squares adjacent to the creature. The wall has hardness 0 and 5 Hit Points per Biohacker level. The mushrooms wilt and dissipate at the end of your next turn.</p></li></ul>"
