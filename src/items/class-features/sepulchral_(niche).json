While unliving energies strengthen your body and grant you supernatural power over life and death, you develop unnatural hungers that drive you to violence. If not controlled, your transformation might tear your body apart at the seams.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmentation Type:</strong> Necrografts</p>\n<p><strong>Class Skill:</strong> Mysticism</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.cdTSC4YQaiL6K0ai]{Instinct}:</strong> Once per round while you have 1 or more MP, when you deal damage with your adaptive strike to a living creature, you can increase the damage dealt to that creature by an amount equal to half your MP total, rounded up. This additional damage you deal increases to your MP total at 7th level, 1-1/2 × your MP total at 13th level, and 2 × your MP total at 19th level.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.kWlspPC0KODKILDD]{Drawback}:</strong> Once per round while you have at least 1 MP and reduce a living creature to 0 HP with your adaptive strike, you must attempt a Will save with a DC = 10 + half your character level + your MP total. If you fail, you must take your first action of your next turn to either make another attack with your adaptive strike that includes the defeated creature as a target or take a move action to spend at least 1 MP with no effect.</p>\n<p>While you have 3 or more MP, the first time you regain Hit Points or Stamina Points from an effect—other than from your grim harvest ability (see below)—you decrease the number of HP or SP you regain by an amount equal to half your MP total, rounded up (minimum 1 HP or SP recovered). The amount by which you reduce the HP or SP you regain increases to your MP total at 7th level, 1-1/2 × your MP total at 10th level, 2 × your MP total at 13th level, and 3 × your MP total at 17th level.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.pcDxiVBii2z40qB3]{Grim Harvest (1st Level)}:</strong> As a reaction when either you reduce a significant enemy to 0 HP with your adaptive strike or a significant enemy within 15 feet of you is reduced to 0 HP, you can spend 1 MP to regain 1d4 Hit Points for every 2 evolutionist levels you have; you can spend 1 additional MP when using this ability to roll d6s instead of d4s, or you can spend 2 additional MP when using this ability to roll d8s instead of d4s.</p>\n<p>Once you use this adaptation, you can’t use it again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.z7AhNjqYUlYO4Pes]{Spectral Step (10th Level)}:</strong> You can spend 2 MP as a move action to become incorporeal and gain a fly speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability until the beginning of your next turn. As part of this action, you can also fly up to 15 feet. When this effect would end, you can extend the duration by 1 round by spending 2 MP, plus an additional MP for each previous round you have extended this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.ao50O73hKw2wWGAv]{Niche Metamorphosis (20th Level)}:</strong> Your creature type becomes undead. You gain immunity to death effects and negative levels.</p>"
