Roll 1d20 + your operative level; the DC is equal to 10 + the item level. If you succeed, you deactivate the device (or suppress the item&rsquo;s magical properties) until the beginning of your next turn. The device&rsquo;s owner can spend a move action and attempt an Engineering check (for technological devices) or a Mysticism check (for magic items) against your operative exploit DC to try to reactivate the device.<br /><br />You can instead use this debilitating trick to temporarily deactivate a construct that has either the magical subtype (such as a golem) or the technological subtype (such as a robot). You don&rsquo;t need to attempt a check, but the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the debilitating effect. If it fails, it&rsquo;s @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} until the beginning of your next turn. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability to attempt to deactivate a construct, that creature is immune to your deactivating shot for 24 hours.</span></p>"
