After resolving your covering fire or harrying fire, attempt the trick attack’s skill check as normal. If you succeed at the check, you provide an additional benefit. For covering fire, if the selected ally is hit by the target’s next attack before the end of your next turn, roll your trick attack damage and reduce the enemy’s damage dealt to your ally by that amount (minimum 0 damage). For harrying fire, if the next ally to attack the target hits, roll your trick attack damage and add it to the attack’s damage. Once an ally takes less damage from your covering fire benefit or a creature takes additional damage from your harrying fire benefit, they are immune to your setup strike’s additional benefit for 24 hours.</p>"
