You gain Piloting as a class skill. Whenever a mech or vehicle you are piloting takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any reductions to that damage, such as from damage reduction, energy resistance, or hardness), you gain 1 EP. You cannot gain this EP as a result of any damaging effect that would cause you to gain EP from your entropic pool class feature (such as if an effect damages both you and your vehicle).</p>"
