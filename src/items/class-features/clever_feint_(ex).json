Attempt a Bluff check with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn’t a standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don’t apply). Even if you fail, that enemy is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} against your attacks (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} against your allies’ attacks until the end of your next turn. You can’t use clever feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever feint as if it were a success.</p>"
