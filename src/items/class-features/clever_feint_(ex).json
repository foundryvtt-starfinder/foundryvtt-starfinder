Attempt a Bluff check with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn&rsquo;t a standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don&rsquo;t apply). Even if you fail, that enemy is flat-footed against your attacks (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also flat-footed against your allies&rsquo; attacks until the end of your next turn. You can&rsquo;t use clever feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score.<br /><br />At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever feint as if it were a success.</span></p>",
