Alternatively you can attempt this skill check against a creature that you can’t see or aren’t aware of if you’ve discovered and identified a set of tracks belonging to the chosen creature that are within 30 feet of you. If you succeed, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls against the target, and to Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against them, as well as all skill checks to recall knowledge about them. The save DCs of your weapon attacks and soldier class abilities also increase by 1 against the target. You can maintain these bonuses against only one opponent at a time, and the bonuses remain in effect until your target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, you hunt a new target, or you end the effect without spending an action. If you fail the check to hunt your foe, you can’t attempt to hunt any creature again for 24 hours.</p>"
