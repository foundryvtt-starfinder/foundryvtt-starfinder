If the attack is a ranged attack, the target must be within the first range increment. Even if the attack normally affects an area or multiple targets, it affects only your selected target. If your attack hits, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your soldier level + your key ability score modifier). If the target fails its save, it can&rsquo;t voluntarily move from its current space for 1d4 rounds. This has no effect on involuntary movement, but it does prevent the creature from teleporting or moving to another plane. Once you&rsquo;ve struck a foe with this attack, whether it succeeds at or fails its saving throw, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</span></p>",
