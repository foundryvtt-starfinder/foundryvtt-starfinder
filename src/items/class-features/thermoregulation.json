The target gains cold resistance 1 and fire resistance 1, and these resistances increase by 1 for every 4 biohacker levels you have. If the creature is burning, it can immediately attempt a Reflex save with a +2 bonus to end the burning effect. If the creature has the staggered condition from failing a saving throw against a cold effect, it can immediately attempt a new saving throw against the effect, ending it on a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhibitor:</strong> You impair a creature’s ability to regulate body temperature. If the target takes fire damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain the burning condition, taking 1d6 fire damage per turn. If the target takes cold damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain a special version of the burning condition that deals 1d6 cold damage per turn, which can be ended automatically by taking fire damage; the target can’t roll on the ground to gain a new saving throw, but instead it can wrap itself in insulating material and shiver as a full action to attempt a new saving throw with a +4 bonus.

For 1 minute, whenever the creature takes cold or fire damage, it becomes shaken for 1 round. The first time during that minute the creature begins its turn with the burning condition, it becomes confused for the duration of the burning effect (Will negates). However, on a d% result of 51–75 to determine the confused creature’s actions (Core Rulebook274), the creature attempts to end the burning condition rather than dealing damage to itself. At the start of each subsequent turn, the creature can attempt a new Will save, ending the confused condition immediately on a success. This is a fear and pain effect.</p>"
