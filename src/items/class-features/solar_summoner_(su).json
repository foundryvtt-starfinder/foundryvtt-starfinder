The star appears next to a foe you choose within 60 feet and makes an attack with a reach of 5 feet. The star’s attack bonus equals your solarian level + your Charisma modifier and targets EAC, and it deals fire damage equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 solarian levels you have beyond 12th level (maximum 6d6 at 20th level), and it deals additional damage equal to half your solarian level if you are fully attuned. The star threatens adjacent foes, and you can use a reaction to have the star make an attack of opportunity. When you spend a move action to move, you can also direct the star to fly up to 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, though it cannot travel more than 60 feet away from you. Once per round as part of your action to make an attack, you can command the star to also make an attack against your target immediately after your attack.</p>\n<p>The star disappears after 1 minute, once you are no longer in photon mode, or once the star has made one attack for every 4 solarian levels you have, whichever occurs first. Once you use this revelation, you cannot do so again until you have spent 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest.</p>\n<p><em>Set the Actor Resources of the summoned Star to the summoner's relevant stats to set the damage correctly.</em></p>"
