      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.classes.WDvGdJ5mMpAD9cWQ]{Vanguard}</p>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.</p>\n<p>You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can’t be changed.Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53–55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Insight - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>Your understanding of a specific aspect of entropy gives you insight into combat and one specific skill that others rarely understand. You gain the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for the listed combat maneuver. Additionally, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks with one skill determined by your aspect.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Embodiment - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain an additional means of generating Entropy Points. If your aspect embodiment requires any interaction with another creature, that creature qualifies only if it is a significant enemy.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Catalyst - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>You have learned to create significant effects under certain conditions, guiding powerful forces with your subconscious mind. You gain an ability that you can use as a reaction the first time you take a critical hit in combat, or as a standard action by expending 4 Entropy Points. You can’t use the ability again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>You also gain an improved version of the ability that you can use without taking an action the first time you reach 0 Stamina Points or 0 Hit Points in a combat encounter, expending all Entropy Points you have, if any. Once you use the improved version of the ability, you can’t do so again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Finale - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;You gain a powerful ability unique to your aspect.</p>\n<h2>Vanguard Aspects</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.rHskhEIkqT1NhkXs]{Apocalypse}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.CEaG6Wu5zTM04S6d]{Boundary}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.mLxGWbcKBzW5xNNd]{Cascade}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.NsxuKKOs4oqxwngX]{Exergy}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.vDMqlFPkkH7ApGdl]{Inversion}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.hxGhCeOFrN0keV9A]{Momentum}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.sFhSadQYdEbvuyYx]{Obsolescence}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.s2666UOaMcZCw251]{Reaction}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.TIwFJCueTgMJBeNz]{Rebound}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.oTrD06MdEikmixg6]{Regression}</p>"
