Double your operative&rsquo;s edge bonus to Bluff and Diplomacy checks when interacting with a creature or creatures who are unfamiliar with your species or home world (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). When you encounter such creatures, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a special Bluff or Diplomacy check whose DC equals 10 + 1-1/2 &times; the highest CR of these creatures, plus 1 for each additional creature in the group (maximum +10 for a group of 11 or more creatures). If you succeed, the creatures&rsquo; starting attitude improves by one step for 1 hour. This improvement doesn&rsquo;t stack with any caused by other effects; however, this exploit&rsquo;s short duration might allow you to attempt longer-lasting adjustments, such as with Diplomacy checks to change attitude.</p>\n<p><em>(Note: this bonus is untyped so it stacks correctly with Operative's Edge, so double check your modifier correct before rolling.)&nbsp;</em></p>"
