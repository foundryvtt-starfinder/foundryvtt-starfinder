You gain one fewer spell slot per day of each level.</p>\n<p>When you learn new magic hacks, you can choose to select any of the following mechanic tricks as though they were magic hacks, using your technomancer level as your mechanic level to qualify for these tricks: drone meld, extra drone mod, hyperclocking, mod tinkerer, overclocking, repair drone, and ultraclocking.</p>\n<p><strong>This alters spells and replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</strong></p>"
