You can apply only special properties that are applicable to the weapon you’re using, so you couldn’t (for example) add quick reload to a weapon that doesn’t use charges or ammunition. The GM is the final arbiter of what can be applied to any weapon. Choose from: aurora, block, breach, breakdown, bright, disarm, echo, extinguish, feint, injection, harrying, penetrating, quick reload, recall, stun, trip.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can add a second weapon special property from that list, or you can add force as a second weapon special property. Alternatively, instead of adding a second property, you can add a critical hit effect from the following list, which applies in addition to any other critical hit effect that applies to the attack: arc (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), bind, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), corrode (1d6, +1d6 per 5 item levels), deafen, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown}. You may add this even if the weapon already has a critical hit effect, and on a critical hit both effects apply. A weapon cannot have two versions of the same critical hit effect.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, you can instead add the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blind}, demoralize, wound, sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon property or a critical hit effect.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can switch any of these customizations for a different customization, but you must always choose at least one customization from the 7th-level list.</p>"
