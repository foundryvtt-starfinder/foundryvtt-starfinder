You gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.seWKgVZbtyOPhl6e]{Nimble Moves (Combat)} feat. If you already have the Nimble Moves feat, you gain an additional combat feat of your choice for which you qualify. Further, you can use Survival in place of Life Science to identify creatures of the plant, animal, and vermin types, and you gain a +1 insight bonus to Survival checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every four levels afterward to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.2PW1GeF1SeJG1K8r]{All-Terrain Movement (Ex) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>You gain a climb speed and a swim speed equal to your land speed. Further, when you gain a fly speed from any source, your fly speed increases by 10 feet. This effect stacks with abilities such as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.DZ1Z6gobHyE9flAA]{Sky Jockey} feat. As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to inspire allies within 30 feet who can see you to match your athletic prowess; affected allies gain a +2 insight bonus to Athletics checks for a number of rounds equal to your key ability modifier.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.j0Z6D5P2W6aVgTef]{Astounding Fortitude (Ex) (9th)}</h2>\n<p>You gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.gHFaGEQj42de9zmT]{Improved Great Fortitude} as a bonus feat. As a reaction, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to have an ally you can see within 10 feet reroll a failed Fortitude save. You can’t affect another ally in this way until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.QZjc7NyALFDDoEEo]{Deft Movement (Ex) (13th)}</h2>\n<p>You easily move around both treacherous terrain and dangerous creatures without either slowing you down. You ignore all non-magical difficult terrain. Further, you don’t provoke attacks of opportunity from moving through an enemy’s threatened space, though you still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal when casting a spell or making a ranged attack.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.SEZJQHjFNe0qNa4y]{Environmental Tolerance (Ex) (17th)}</h2>\n<p>You gain cold and fire resistance equal to your level. If you have cold or fire resistance from another source, then this resistance stacks with one other source to a maximum value of 1-1/2 × your soldier level.</p>"
