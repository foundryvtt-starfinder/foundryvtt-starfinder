The creature attempts a Will save against this mind‑affecting compulsion effect. If they succeed, they are shaken for 1 round by the unsettling experience. If they fail, the creature flinches and misses with the triggering attack, and additional attacks they make against you until the beginning of their next turn take a –2 penalty. Once you’ve used this ability, you cannot do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.</p>"
