Rampant life energy heals your wounds, yet your thoughts become equally impulsive and direct.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmentation Type:</strong> Biotech</p>\n<p><strong>Class Skill:</strong> Life Science</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PYre1EFkHDxVLMrk]{Instinct}:</strong> Once per round while you have 1 or more MP, the first time you regain Hit Points or Stamina Points from an effect, you increase the number of HP or SP you regain by an amount equal to half your MP total, rounded up. The additional HP or SP you regain increases to your MP total at 7th level, 1-1/2 × your MP total at 10th level, 2 × your MP total at 13th level, and 3 × your MP total at 17th level.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.pDqFedYpqzryKzBR]{Drawback}:</strong> Your mind and body react with greater impulsiveness and less control. While you have at least 1 MP you take a penalty to Will saves equal to half your MP total, rounded up. While you have at least 3 MP, you can’t use any ability that requires patience or concentration, such as spellcasting or any Charisma- or Intelligence-based skills except Intimidate.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.LJ3ue12jvAlvP7uT]{Biotic Invigoration (1st Level)}:</strong> As a swift action, you can spend 1 MP to regain a number of Stamina Points equal to your evolutionist level. At the start of each of your next three turns, you and one adjacent ally regain a number of Stamina Points equal to your evolutionist level. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.DZiUe3hm8z4OKTxn]{Adrenaline Rush (10th Level)}:</strong> You move with an exceptional burst of speed. As a swift action, you take a guarded step and gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC and Reflex saves until the beginning of your next turn. If you spend 2 MP when activating this evolution, you can instead move up to half your speed with the guarded step and the enhancement bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.PRbkHvmr7md75tBe]{Niche Metamorphosis (20th Level)}:</strong> Your creature type becomes your choice of aberration, monstrous humanoid, ooze, or plant. You gain immunity to critical hit effects and reduce any damage you take from critical hits by an amount equal to 20 + your key ability score modifier.</p>"
