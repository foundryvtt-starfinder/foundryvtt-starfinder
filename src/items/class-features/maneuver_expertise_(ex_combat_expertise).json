Choose one combat maneuver. When resisting this combat maneuver, you gain a bonus to KAC equal to the minimum result of your expertise die. Additionally, if you attempt an attack roll to resolve the chosen combat maneuver, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to add your expertise die to the attack roll’s result as an insight bonus. Once you have added this bonus to a combat maneuver attack roll, you can’t do so again until you have regained Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.<br>You must have the combat expertise alternate class feature to select this expertise talent.
