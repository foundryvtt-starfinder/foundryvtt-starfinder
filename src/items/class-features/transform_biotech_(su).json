You can permanently transfer your personal modification to a different biological system, changing its granted benefit, as long as the new system isn&rsquo;t already occupied by a modification. Alternatively, you can cause a biotech augmentation you have had installed to function as your personal modification would if it were installed in that system, suppressing the normal functions of that augmentation but allowing you to gain the benefits of your personal modification for that system (in addition to the system your personal modification currently occupies).</p><p>As a third option, you can temporarily alter one of your biotech augmentations. When you activate the transform biotech ability in this way, select one of your existing biotech augmentations that required you to make a choice when it was installed, such as the type of damage dealt by a dragon gland. You can select a new option for this augmentation as if it were newly installed.</p>"
