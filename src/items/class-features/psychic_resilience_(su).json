At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d6 as your expertise die instead of 1d4. As a reaction before you attempt a Will save against a mind-affecting effect, you can roll your expertise die and add the result of the roll to your saving throw as an enhancement bonus. You must have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining to increase your saving throw in this way, and once you have done so, you cannot do so again until you have regained Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, or Medicine. You are treated as having expertise with that skill for the purposes of expertise talents and other prerequisites, though you do not actually add your expertise die to any skill checks except Sense Motive.</p>\n<p><em>As added skills are chosen, create modifiers in the Modifiers tab, using the formula in the Sense Motive modifier.</em></p>"
