If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your drone can attempt to administer emergency medical treatment to you, even despite you being @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}. On subsequent rounds on your turn, your drone takes as many move actions as necessary to return to your side, followed by a standard action to administer first aid. Once it has done so, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to recover a number of Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. Your drone cannot use this mod on anyone but you nor use it if you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} or have fewer than 2 RP remaining. You can’t benefit from this treatment more than once every 24 hours. Your drone must have the manipulator arms and skill subroutines (with the Medicine skill) mods to select this mod.</p>"
