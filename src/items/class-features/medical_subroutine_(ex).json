If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your drone can attempt to administer emergency medical treatment to you, even despite you being @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}. On subsequent rounds on your turn, your drone takes as many move actions as necessary to return to your side, followed by a standard action to administer first aid. Once it has done so, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to recover a number of Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. Your drone cannot use this mod on anyone but you nor use it if you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} or have fewer than 2 RP remaining. You canâ€™t benefit from this treatment more than once every 24 hours. Your drone must have the manipulator arms and skill subroutines (with the Medicine skill) mods to select this mod.</p>"
