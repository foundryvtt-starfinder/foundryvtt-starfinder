When you succeed at a Diplomacy check to improve a creature’s attitude by 4 or less, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat your Diplomacy check as though you had exceeded the check’s DC by 5 for the purpose of modifying the creature’s attitude further.</p>\n<p>If your check result already exceeds the DC by 5 or more, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reduce the number of additional minutes you need to spend interacting with the creature to improve their attitude further by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 minute). If their attitude is already helpful when you do so, rather than improve their attitude through further interaction, you inspire their efforts to help you; this grants the creature a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws to assist you with a task. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes or until the creature helps you overcome a significant obstacle. Such a creature’s attitude remains helpful, and they still provide help only within reasonable means.</p>"
