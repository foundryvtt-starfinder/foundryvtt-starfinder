You can remain in this form for 1 minute per nanocyte level or until you revert to your natural form as a move action, though you can extend the duration by an additional 1 minute per nanocyte level by spending an additional nanite surge. While transformed, your speed is 20 feet, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet, you can move through an area as small as one-quarter of your own space without squeezing, and you can squeeze through openings as small as 1 inch wide. You gain a circumstance bonus equal to your Constitution modifier to Acrobatics checks to escape and to your KAC to resist being grappled or pinned. You also gain DR 5/ magic; this doesn’t stack with other forms of damage reduction. You’re unable to speak, attack, cast spells, use items, or perform tasks that require fine manual dexterity while transformed. This is a polymorph effect.</p>"
