      "value": "<p>&gt;@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.0JZU0FVnvAJ08fVR]{Paradigm Shift}</p>\n<p>Like a ship’s wake, your allies’ determination sends ripples through reality, making it easier for you to reach into other worlds. When an ally within 30 feet of you expends one or more Resolve Points, you can attempt to draw power from their determination as a reaction. You have a percent chance to succeed equal to 20% times the number of Resolve Points the ally expended. If you succeed, you gain a temporary 1st-level spell slot that you can only expend to activate your @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.Item.fqh91mM5CY6tJp4J]{Infinite Worlds (Su)} class ability (or alternate class ability that replaces infinite worlds). The spell slot increases to 2nd level if both you and the ally are at least 9th level, to 3rd level if both you and the ally are at least 14th level, and to 4th level if both you and the ally are at least 19th level. You retain this spell slot for 1d4+1 rounds or until you expend it, whichever comes first. Once you gain a spell slot in this way, you cannot do so again until you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points during a 10-minute rest.</p>"
