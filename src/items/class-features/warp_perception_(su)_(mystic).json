Select up to one creature that you can see for every 2 mystic levels you have. Each creature selected this way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to perceive you, as greater invisibility. If you spend 1 Resolve Point when you use this ability, it also baffles senses such as blindsense or blindsight. At the end of an affected creature’s turn, it can attempt another save against this effect. You can end your invisibility as a move action. You can use this ability for a number of rounds each day equal to your mystic level; these rounds don’t need to be consecutive.</p>\n</div>"
