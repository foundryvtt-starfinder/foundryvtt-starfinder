The spell’s level cannot exceed the maximum spell level you can empower with your spell speaker ability, and the ally must expend the appropriate available spell slot. You use your envoy level as the caster level, and you use your Charisma modifier to calculate the spell’s saving throw DCs. Activating this improvisation and casting the spell takes a standard action or an amount of time equal to the spell’s casting time, whichever is longer. Each time you use this improvisation per day, its Resolve Point cost increases by 1.</p>\n<p>You must be 4th level and have the spell speaker alternate class ability to choose this improvisation.</p>"
