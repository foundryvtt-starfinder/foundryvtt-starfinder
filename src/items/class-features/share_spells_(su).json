If you and your chosen linked creature are within 60 feet of each other at the time you cast such a spell, you can designate that creature as either the conduit or the target. A conduit can deliver a touch spell as if it were you. Because you power the spell, if you cast another spell before the touch is delivered, the spell imbued in your linked creature ends. If you designate a linked creature as the target of a spell that normally has a range of personal, the linked creature is affected as if it were you, and you are unaffected.</p>"
