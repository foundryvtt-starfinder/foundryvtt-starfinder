If you took damage from multiple types of energy damage as part of the same attack or effect, you choose one to gain energy resistance against. You can have resistance against only one energy type from reactive resistance at a time. If you use this ability to gain resistance against a new damage type, any previous resistance gained from this ability is lost.</p>"
