That ally ignores one condition (see page 273) of your choice until the start of your next turn, chosen from the following list: confused, fascinated, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.JGFn4MrDZ6X5vrzU]{Fatigued}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken}, sickened, and staggered.</p>\n<p>While your ally doesn’t suffer the effects of the condition during that period, the condition is merely suppressed, not removed, and its effects resume at the start of your next turn. The condition can still be removed with spells, technology, and other effects as normal.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, add the following conditions to the list: cowering, dazed, exhausted, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.DtwiUWi8dpzkq4tM]{Frightened}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.BVdjvpucmvQU4cc1]{Panicked}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.NV4qXRDgb7zTNkW2]{Paralyzed}, and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned}.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to remove the condition with this ability instead of suppressing it. You can’t remove a condition with a permanent duration (see page 271) in this way; if you attempt to do so, your attempt fails but you don’t lose the Resolve Point.</p>"
