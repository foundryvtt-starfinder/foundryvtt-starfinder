If you succeed by 10 or more at the skill check to deal additional damage on a trick attack but miss your subsequent attack roll, you can choose to sabotage your target’s move action or standard action. If the target then performs the chosen action, they take damage equal to the additional damage you would have dealt with your trick attack. Normally, all damage taken is the same as your attack; however, a GM might change the damage based on their description of the action. If you spend 2 Resolve Points when you use this exploit, you can trigger your own plan as a reaction and add the effects of a debilitating trick. Once you’ve used this ability, you can’t use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</p>"
