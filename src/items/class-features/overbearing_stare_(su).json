You can focus your gaze on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, bringing down upon it the full might of unseen spirits associated with your connection. The target must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 penalty to the chosen statistic. You can maintain this effect against only one opponent at a time, and it remains in effect until you stare at a new target, the opponent moves more than 30 feet away from you, or either you or the opponent fall unconscious or dies. The penalties of multiple overbearing stares don’t stack. Once you have used this ability against a target, you can’t do so again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent curse effect.</p>",
