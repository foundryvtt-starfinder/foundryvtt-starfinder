When moving in this way, any liquid or solid surface will support you, regardless of your weight. You can move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches, and environmental circumstances such as the slipperiness of the area you’re moving through or the current wind speed do not adjust the DCs of any Acrobatics or Athletics checks you attempt during this movement. While moving this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched while moving in this way, such as from lava, and you don’t trigger any traps that use a location-based trigger. This ability doesn’t allow you to move across gases or vacuums, nor does it allow you to move across walls or vertical surfaces (though you can do so if you have an ability that allows you to, such as spider climb). At the end of your turn, this ability ends, and you are subject to any consequence of your location.</span></p>",
