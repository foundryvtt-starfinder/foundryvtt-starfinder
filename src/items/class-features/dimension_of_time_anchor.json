You might have encountered a hound of Tindalos or a time dimensional at some point in your life that created this unerring bond. You could explore the cosmos as an unwitting agent for the mysterious powers within the Dimension of Time, or you could simply use your powers for personal gain.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Focal Paradox:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Reflex saving throws.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.ZWhh2QbaiNNTquEs]{Improved Anchor}:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once per day, you can touch an object in your possession of 1 bulk or less. The object is protected from mundane effects of the passage of time (for example, metal does not rust, and fruit does not ripen or spoil) as long as you maintain this effect on it. You can maintain this effect on a number of objects equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1) at any one time. If you exceed this limit, the oldest existing effect immediately ends. This ability has no effect on the functionality of technological objects.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle3\">@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.A4b9Zc69rRMYBjC1]{Greater Anchor}: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can unfetter your ability to travel as you traverse through perfect moments in time. Once per day as a swift action, you can move through difficult terrain without penalty, you increase all of your speeds by 20 feet, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against any effects that would impart the entangled, exhausted, fatigued, flat-footed, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned conditions. These benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your precog level.</span></p>"
