Choose another object or creature with the technological subtype within 30 feet of the first target, and make a second attack with your entropic strike at a –4 penalty. If you hit and can perform additional reactions that turn, you can use another reaction to perform a third attack against a different object or creature with the technological subtype.</p>\n<p>You determine line of sight and the range of this attack starting from one corner of the first target’s space. The second attack is treated as an attack in a full attack for the purposes of abilities that reduce the penalties for full attacks.</p>"
