The black hole appears next to a foe you choose within 60 feet and makes an attack with a reach of 5 feet. The black hole’s attack bonus equals your solarian level + your Charisma modifier and targets KAC. A successful attack deals bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 solarian levels you have beyond 12th level (maximum 6d8 at 20th level), and it deals additional damage equal to half your solarian level if you are fully attuned. The black hole threatens adjacent foes and, although it cannot make attacks of opportunity, you can spend a reaction to halt an adjacent creature’s movement as though the black hole had the Stand Still feat. When you spend a move action to move, you can also direct the black hole to fly up to 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, though it cannot travel more than 60 feet away from you. Once per round as part of your action to make an attack, you can command the black hole to also make an attack against your target immediately after your attack.</p>\n<p>The black hole disappears after 1 minute, once you are no longer in graviton mode, or once the black hole has made one attack for every 4 solarian levels you have, whichever occurs first. Once you use this revelation, you cannot do so again until you have spent 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest.</p>"
