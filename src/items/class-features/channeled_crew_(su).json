You can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Wisdom modifier when calculating your Mysticism modifier when performing magic officer<sup>COM</sup> crew actions. You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a minor crew action during the engineering phase of starship combat to absorb the technical expertise of a crew member from an alternate reality. When you do so, choose one skill used to resolve starship combat crew actions. For 1d4+1 rounds, you can perform crew actions as though you had a number of ranks in that skill equal to half your witchwarper level, and your modifier for that skill when performing starship crew actions equals your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
