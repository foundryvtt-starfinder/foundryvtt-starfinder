When you succeed at a Mysticism check to perform the scrying magic officer<sup>COM</sup> crew action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to learn one less piece of information and instead temporarily alter one of that starship’s properties. Choose one of the effects below for which you have successfully learned the associated piece of information. Each effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and an engineer can end the effect before then as if it were a glitching critical damage condition. Once you apply one of these effects to a starship, that starship becomes immune to further uses of that effect for 24 hours, though you can use this paradigm shift to apply other effects to that starship.</p>\n<p><strong>Awkward (basic information):</strong> The first time each round that the starship turns, the pilot must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 your witchwarper level) or move at least one additional hex before turning, as if the starship’s maneuverability were one category worse. This has no effect on starships with clumsy maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotically Calibrated (weapon):</strong> Choose up to three of the starship’s weapons. Whenever a gunner operating one of those weapons rolls a natural 1 on their gunnery check, the weapon misfires catastrophically, dealing half the weapon’s damage to the starship; this damage bypasses the starship’s shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Explosively Unstable (load):</strong> You increase the volatility of some of the starship’s cargo, triggering an imminent explosion. The starship’s sensors immediately detect the threat, alerting its crew (and allowing the engineer to end this effect and avert damage). At the beginning of the next helm phase, that cargo explodes, dealing 1d6 damage to the starship for every 3 witchwarper levels you have; this damage bypasses the starship’s shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Fragile (defenses):</strong> Reduce the starship’s critical threshold by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. The cannot reduce the critical threshold below half its starting value.</p>"
