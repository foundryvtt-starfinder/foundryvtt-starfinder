The target must be adjacent to you or within the first range increment of a ranged injection weapon you&rsquo;re wielding. The target treats the fall as if it were 20 feet shorter, plus an additional 10 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point when you use this theorem to instead target an ally who is about to take bludgeoning damage from an attack or spell. The ally reduces the damage taken by an amount equal to twice your key ability score modifier. At 10th level, this amount increases to three times your key ability score modifier, and at 15th level, this amount increases to four times your key ability score modifier. Once a creature has benefited from this use of cushion the blow, they cannot benefit from it again until they take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.</p>"
