When you gain the soldier’s onslaught class feature, you can make two attacks instead of one at the end of your charge, both with a –4 penalty.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"m8OEzHyK2fs79LAP\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Keep Fighting (Ex) (3rd)</a></h2>\n        <p>As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points equal to 2d6 + your soldier level. You can’t use this ability again until after you regain Stamina Points from a 10-minute rest. The number of Stamina Points you regain increases by 1d6 at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"IlyzRIm03pslJJh6\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Perfect Opportunity (Ex) (4th)</a></h2>\n        <p>When you hit a creature with an attack of opportunity, that creature can’t move out of the squares you threaten until the start of its next turn. In addition, when an enemy takes a guarded step (see page 247) out of a square you threaten, you can make an attack of opportunity against it with a –2 penalty to the attack roll. If the target provoked an attack of opportunity by moving, hitting with your attack of opportunity ends the target’s movement immediately, preventing it from carrying out the rest of its movement.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"0uRrPeGV84fu4cQ7\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Against the Odds (Ex) (5th)</a></h2>\n        <p>You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to double the number of enemies within 10 feet of you. Enemies who don’t constitute a significant threat (those with a CR equal to your level – 4 or less, or as determined by the GM) don’t count when calculating this bonus.</p>",
