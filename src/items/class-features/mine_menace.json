To compensate for their smaller stature, kobolds often employ traps to hinder their foes and level the playing field. Most notably, this fighting style relies on deploying inexpensive proximity mines and making cunning strikes while an opponent is rattled by the explosions.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.iOZyHDMOYnr7dQBh]{Set Charge (Ex) (1st)}</h2>\n<p>You gain Stealth as a class skill. You can create an explosive mine with light bulk without paying for it; this process takes 10 minutes and can be performed when you spend a Resolve Point to rest and regain Stamina Points. You can have only one mine created by this ability at a time. As a full action that requires a free hand, you can draw, arm, and deploy the mine in a 5-foot square within 30 feet, after which the mine conceals itself with an active camouflage field. Only you can use your mines effectively.</p>\n<p>Any creatures observing you when you deploy the mine automatically notices the mine’s location; other creatures must attempt a Perception check (DC 10 + your soldier level + your key ability score modifier) the first time they’re within 30 feet of the mine to spot it; this doesn’t require an action. A creature can disable a mine it spotted with a successful Engineering check (DC 10 + your soldier level + your key ability score modifier) as though it were a trap, and the mine deactivates harmlessly if destroyed (hardness 10, with Hit Points equal to 3 × your soldier level). A mine remains armed for 1 hour or until you create a new mine.</p>\n<p>The next time a creature enters the square, the mine explodes, dealing 1d4 fire and piercing damage to any creaturein that square and imposing a –5-foot penalty to its speed for 1d4 rounds. A mine doesn’t explode if a creature begins its turn in the same square, but it does explode if the creature leaves and reenters the square. The damage increases to 1d8 at your 3rd soldier level, 2d8 at 7th level, 3d8 at 11th level, 5d8 at 15th level, and 8d8 at 19th level. The speed penalty increases to –10 feet at 11th level, but it can’t reduce a creature’s speeds below half their normal values.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.9qHzpvBvXzoA2C58]{Explosive Maneuver (Ex) (2nd)}</h2>\n<p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls made to perform bull rush or reposition combat maneuvers to move a creature into a square that contains your deployed mine. This bonus increases to +3 at 9th level, +4 at 13th level, and +5 at 17th level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.MVFUrGXCOEecw36m]{Cunning Strike (Ex) (3rd)}</h2>\n<p>Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you gain this ability. You gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to the chosen ability score’s modifier against creatures that are entangled, helpless, stunned, or have a penalty to their movement speed. This damage bonus increases by 1 at 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.H2fHq89PKfJ6TAR0]{Minefield (Ex) (4th)}</h2>\n<p>You can now create 1d3 mines with 10 minutes of work, and have and deploy up to three armed mines at a time. You can’t deploy a mine within 10 feet of another mine.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.NW0VFRMwHmARD5ia]{Masterful Mayhem (Ex) (5th)}</h2>\n<p>Once per round when a mine you deployed is triggered you can increase its area of effect to also affect all squares within 10 feet of the mine. All creatures in that area take damage (Reflex half), but only the triggering creature gains the speed penalty. As a reaction when one of your mines explodes, you can choose a number of squares equal to your key ability score that aren’t affected.</p>"
