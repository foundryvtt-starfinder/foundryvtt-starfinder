When you do so, you are not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, you lose the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.dkDzFtHOTXLnJivf]{Skill Focus} feat granted by your exocortex’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.yeAW67ho3SsxqJNR]{Memory Module (Ex)} and cannot use any of the exocortex’s abilities in any way (including any proficiencies and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.z8iOan4RJXYvVhit]{Mods} it grants you). When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the exocortex, spells such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.KQ4vSfG9tq8EJxir]{Dispel Magic}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.ECQacpm9nCOg31Hy]{Break Enchantment}</em> can be cast on you to end the effect as if you were affected by it. Once the duration of the mind-affecting effect has ended, your exocortex resumes its normal functions. You must have an exocortex to learn this trick.</p>"
