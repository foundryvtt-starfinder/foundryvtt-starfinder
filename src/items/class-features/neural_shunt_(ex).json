When you do so, you are not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, you lose the Skill Focus feat granted by your exocortex’s memory module and cannot use any of the exocortex’s abilities in any way (including any proficiencies and mods it grants you). When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the exocortex, spells such as <em>dispel magic</em> or <em>break enchantment</em> can be cast on you to end the effect as if you were affected by it. Once the duration of the mind-affecting effect has ended, your exocortex resumes its normal functions. You must have an exocortex to learn this trick.</p>"
