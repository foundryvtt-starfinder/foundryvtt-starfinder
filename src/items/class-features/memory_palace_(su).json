This memory palace has a single shimmering entrance. You can access your memory palace once per day; when you do, the entrance appears within close range. If any creatures or objects that were not part of the memory palace when it was created remain inside it, the entrance remains where it first appeared. Only those you designate can enter the memory palace, and the entrance closes and becomes invisible behind you when you enter. Anyone inside can open the entrance and exit the memory palace at will. The only way to enter and exit the memory palace is via the entrance; even <em>plane shift</em> and similar magic do not access it.<br><br>You can create any floor plan you desire for your memory palace, up to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your mystic level. Inside, the atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm; outside conditions don’t affect the memory palace, nor do conditions inside it pass beyond. There is no furniture other than bookcases, computers, and a few desks and sofas. A number of unseen servants (as per the spell of the same name) equal to half your mystic level serve as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you access it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating—you don’t need to be inside it to alter it.<br><br>When you gain this ability, choose one skill that can be used with the recall knowledge task. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within—including you—a +4 enhancement bonus to skill checks to recall knowledge of that type, and creatures inside the memory palace can attempt checks of that type untrained. At 16th level, and at each level thereafter, choose another skill that can be used with the recall knowledge task to which your memory palace’s skill bonus applies.</span></p>"
