Choose two 0-level spells, two 1st-level spells, two 2nd-level spells, and two 3rd-level spells from the technomancer spell list. You can craft spell chips of these spells, provided you have a number of ranks in Computers equal to the number of ranks in Mysticism that would normally be required. Rather than access to a workshop, you need access to a computer of a tier greater than or equal to the level of the spell you are programming into the spell chip. At 9th level and each subsequent mechanic level, you can choose one additional technomancer spell for which you can create spell chips. Beginning at 11th level, you can choose 4th-level technomancer spells. At 14th level, you can choose 5th-level technomancer spells, and at 17th level, you can choose 6th-level technomancer spells.</p>"
