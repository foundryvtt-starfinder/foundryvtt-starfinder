While wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you can move up to your speed when you make a full attack. You can move before or after all your attacks, but not both. If you have the Shot on the Run feat, you can divide your movement to move both before and after making a full attack as long as all the attacks are ranged attacks. If you have the Spring Attack feat, you can divide your movement to move both before and after making a full attack as long as all the attacks are melee attacks. If you have both feats, your attacks can be any combination of melee and ranged attacks.</p>"
