The ally must spend the Resolve Point before the start of your next turn; if he does not do so, he loses the Resolve Point and you still lose the Resolve Points you spent. You canâ€™t grant the same ally the benefits of this ability again until both you and your ally have recovered your Resolve Points after an 8-hour rest or its equivalent.</span></p>"
