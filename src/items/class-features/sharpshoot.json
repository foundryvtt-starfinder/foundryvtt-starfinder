If your first attack kills or knocks out the target, you can instead make the second attack against a different creature at a –4 penalty. Once you have the soldier’s onslaught class feature (see page 112), you can use this ability with it, making three attacks against the same creature at a –5 penalty; if your first or second attack kills or knocks out your target, you can make your remaining attacks against a different creature at a –6 penalty.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"pDHan7m22IJqR0NR\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Intense Focus (Ex) (3rd)</a></h2>\n        <p>When you make a ranged attack against a target with cover or concealment, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate its AC bonus from cover and reduce its concealment by one category (from total concealment to concealment or from concealment to no concealment). This benefit applies to all ranged attacks you make against that target this round. You can’t use intense focus more than once per round, nor can you use it against an enemy with total cover.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"N8Qqdeeerofp1eTg\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Focused Damage (Ex) (4th)</a></h2>\n        <p>When you use focus fire, each attack against the first target deals 2d6 additional damage. Additional creatures you attack after killing or knocking out your first target don’t take this extra damage.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"title\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.class-features\" data-id=\"F50g3pNpPhT5n9f3\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Prepared Shot (Ex) (5th)</a></h2>\n        <p>As a standard action, you can study a target before you attack. The target must be within line of sight of you and either @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} or unaware of your presence. On the first attack you make against that target on your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll. If your attack hits, the target is staggered for 1 round; if you score a critical hit, the target is instead @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} for 1 round. Once you make a prepared shot, you can’t use this ability again against the same target for 24 hours. You can’t make an attack on the same round you study the target, even if an ability would let you attack without spending a standard or full action.</p>",
