When you take this temporal anomaly, you can select the means in which you communicate with your confidant. They could appear to you as a holographic avatar only you can see and hear, or as visions that permeate your dreams. Regardless of what form your confidant takes, they can occasionally provide you with some insight that helps you navigate the present.</p>\n<p>As a full action, you can use a paradox to consult with your confidant; you count as trained with a skill for up to a number of rounds equal to the paradox.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, when you attempt a skill check for a skill in which you are normally untrained, you can substitute the paradox used for this ability in place of the d20 roll for that skill check. At 9th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on the skill check, increasing to +8 at 12th level and +12 at 15th level.</p>\n<p><em>Only have this feature active while using an untrained skill.</em></p>"
