Your magic can ease Drift travel, fold space, and impose Drift-like conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Jr4DAaJPRZYMAV1n]{Desna}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.FYV6RgTjPdg72RF0]{Triune}, @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KZvxBU9KGbqRCKkv]{Weydan}<br /><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.IqOCYDKd9NgBwowp]{Computers}&nbsp;and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.2xZnjhTSiLu0uoXB]{Piloting}<br /><strong>Spells:</strong> 1st - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.2l5Xk1YMzp0hlUok]{Life Bubble}, 2nd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.UVzRPQeiV2yl6QAn]{Fog Cloud}, 3rd - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.e6iK8NCKZTNkDffh]{Pinpoint Navigation}, 4th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.l9qGjdH8Fs4GNZAf]{Elemental Convergence}, 5th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.CL7z3gbZwpJtAt0p]{Call Cosmos}, 6th - @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.rJqk12KW4phqFpI5]{Summon Drift Beacons}<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.c1KOLgDdzEPmtcLp]{Drift Step (Su) - 1st Level}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can tap into the transitory nature of the Drift, enabling you to move further with each step than normally possible. For a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round), you gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to all of your speeds, and you can move up to 10 feet each time you take a guarded step. The enhancement bonus to speeds increases to +20 feet at 7th level and +30 feet at 15th level. You can use Drift step up to three times per day.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.skOr55ucPoPYotcf]{Prismatic Nimbus (Su) - 3rd Level}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can emit a vibrant purple and pink aura of light reminiscent of the Drift. Your body sheds normal light in a 15-foot radius. A creature that enters or ends its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round. At 11th level, you instead shed normal light in a 30-foot radius. You can maintain your nimbus for a number of minutes per day equal to your mystic level; this duration doesn&rsquo;t need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.LHRJXaYVzZApuMfv]{Unfold Space (Su) - 6th Level}</h2>\n<p>As a reaction when you&rsquo;re targeted with an attack of which you&rsquo;re aware, you can expend an unused mystic spell slot to unfold the space between you and the attacker, distorting the distance the attack must traverse to reach you. You gain an enhancement bonus to your AC against the attack equal to the level of the spell slot expended. If the triggering attack hits, you can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + the attacker&rsquo;s CR); if you succeed, you regain the expended spell slot. Once you&rsquo;ve targeted an attacker, you can&rsquo;t target the same attacker with this ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.Ep2lhHFFr5Swt4XM]{Consume Matter (Su) - 9th Level}</h2>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to shatter molecular bonds in a 30-foot cone, absorbing some of the fragmented matter much like the Drift consumes planar material. Creatures in the area take 1d6 acid damage for every two mystic levels you have (maximum 10d6). Each creature in the area can attempt a Reflex save to halve this damage. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt to one of the affected creatures. You gain any Hit Points recovered in excess of your maximum Hit Point total as temporary Hit Points that last 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.2SglbYPBibo86Yjn]{Quantum Entanglement (Su) - 12th Level}</h2>\n<p>Creatures linked by your telepathic bond class feature become entangled on a quantum level. You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to select any two willing or unconscious creatures linked by your telepathic bond. The two creatures teleport into the other&rsquo;s space, swapping places. Both creatures must be at most 120 feet away from you. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve regained Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest. This is a teleportation effect.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.NyI15GW3o0hoANLx]{Integrate Matter (Su) - 15th Level}</h2>\n<p>When one or more creatures fail their saving throw against your consume matter connection power, you gain one of the following from one of those creatures for 1d4 rounds: the creature&rsquo;s damage reduction; the creature&rsquo;s resistance or immunity to one energy type; or the creature&rsquo;s immunity to one type of effect (such as poison). You choose the ability gained, and if you choose an ability the creature doesn&rsquo;t have, you gain one of these abilities the creature does have, chosen at random.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.8TTmJHBWU6Evb37B]{Embrace the Drift (Su) - 18th Level}</h2>\n<p>You transform into a spectra-like being, intrinsically linked to the Drift. You no longer need to breathe and are immune to the harmful environmental effects of outer space and a vacuum. You can automatically sense the direction and relative distance of the nearest five Drift beacons, and you can navigate to Alluvion as though you had a beacon code. While you&rsquo;re on a starship with a Drift engine, you treat the rating of that Drift engine as 1 higher (maximum 6). While you&rsquo;re in the Drift, you have a supernatural fly speed of 90 feet (perfect maneuverability).<br />Your body functions as a personal Drift engine. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you can spend 1, 4, 9, or 16 Resolve Points to enter the Drift, navigate the plane using the rules for Drift navigation, and (optionally) exit to the Material Plane as though you had a Drift engine rating of 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. While doing so, you can use either Mysticism or Piloting to navigate.</p>"
