Choose one of the following categories that best fits your immortal tutor: aeon, celestial, elemental, fiend, inevitable, or protean. You gain the benefits associated with that tutor.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to cast a specific variable‑level spell once per day without expending a spell slot as though it were one of your known technomancer spells, and you do so using the spell level equal to the highest-level technomancer spell you can cast.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, when you cast a 1st-level or higher technomancer spell, you can gain the tutor’s first lesson for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. After you do so, you can’t use the first lesson again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to gain the benefits of your patron’s second lesson. At 18th level, you learn your patron’s third lesson, which grants an additional benefit whenever the first lesson ability is active.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.</strong></p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.eOrFkkHvGjHFLqFC]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Aeon}</h3>\n<p>You have learned reality-warping mathematics from the cosmos’s faceless custodians.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.wdIF3tBRy4XAEyZq]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Celestial}</h3>\n<p>Benevolent outsiders showed you the miracle’s sacred tech.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.nT7Vm4iuPmWBqRvQ]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Elemental}</h3>\n<p>A powerful elemental patron honed your fundamentals. Choose an elemental type for your patron: air, earth, fire, or water.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.izwXGb47fdrQ8qQw]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Fiend}</h3>\n<p>You’ve learned technological exploits from evil outsiders.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.66ibBJ8uiKSuMvhu]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Inevitable}</h3>\n<p>The precision of Axis formed the foundation of your studies.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.R9jL6JIFvO0e6Q5L]{Immortal Tutor (Su) - Protean}</h3>\n<p>You learned to innovate your technomancy to keep pace with the Maelstrom’s everchanging criteria and physics.</p>"
