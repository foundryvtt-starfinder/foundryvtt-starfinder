Your fulcrum has an item level equal to your evolutionist level and you can install weapon fusions and fusion seals onto your fulcrum as if it were a weapon of that level. While openly wearing or carrying your fulcrum, your adaptive strike gains the effects of any fusions installed on your fulcrum so long as those fusions could be applied to a weapon of that type (for example, a disruptive weapon fusion functions only if your adaptive strike deals bludgeoning damage). So long as your fulcrum has at least one fusion installed, your adaptive strike also counts as a magic weapon.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br><em>Attach your fusions and fusion seals to your Adaptive Strike weapon item. Adjust your Adaptive Strike weapon item's container settings as you level.</em></span></span></p>"
