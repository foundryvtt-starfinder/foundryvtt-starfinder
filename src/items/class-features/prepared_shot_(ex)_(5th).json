The target must be within line of sight of you and either @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} or unaware of your presence. On the first attack you make against that target on your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll. If your attack hits, the target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered} for 1 round; if you score a critical hit, the target is instead @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} for 1 round. Once you make a prepared shot, you can’t use this ability again against the same target for 24 hours. You can’t make an attack on the same round you study the target, even if an ability would let you attack without spending a standard or full action.</p>"
