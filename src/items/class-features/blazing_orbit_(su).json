The flames last for 1 round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into them. You can’t move through another creature’s space during this movement. If you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out. The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.<br><br>When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage; see page 273).</span></p>"
