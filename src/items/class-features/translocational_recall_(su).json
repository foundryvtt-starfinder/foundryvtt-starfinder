As a swift action, you can instantly teleport from your current location to the location where you placed your translocational beacon, provided the beacon has at least 1 Hit Point and is no further than 10 feet × your technomancer level from your current location. This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, although it does create a dazzling flash of neon light (Perception DC 0 to notice).<br>A transdimensional beacon is a Fine object with negligible bulk, hardness equal to your technomancer level, and Hit Points equal to 3 × your technomancer level. Your spell cache monitors your beacon, and you are automatically alerted if it is destroyed or you move out of its range. You can have only one beacon active at a time, and creating a new beacon causes the old beacon to immediately collapse and become inert.</span></p>",
