This gremlin is a special creature companion that you immediately obtain and bond with, granting you the Creature Companion Adept feat. You can use Mysticism ranks in place of Survival ranks to qualify for the Creature Companion Expert, Creature Companion Master, and creature Companion Virtuoso feats. If your gremlin companion dies, you can conjure and bond with a new gremlin companion 24 hours later as part of a ritual that takes 8 hours to complete. Your companion has the following statistics.</p>\n<h2>GLITCH GREMLIN</h2>\n<table class=\"NormalTable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"92\">Level 1-20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Tiny fey</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> low-light vision</p>\n<p><strong>Good Save</strong> Will;<strong></strong><strong>Poor Saves</strong> Fort, Ref</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft., climb 20 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee Attack</strong> bite (P)</p>\n<p><strong>Melee Attack</strong> jolt (E)</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> 2-1/2 ft.<strong>Reach</strong> 0 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> Dex, Int</p>\n<h4><strong>SPECIAL ABILITIES</strong></h4>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jolt (Su)</strong> Every 1d4 rounds, a glitch gremlin can channel an electrical blast as a ranged attack that targets EAC. This ray has a range increment of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Short Circuit (Su, 7th level)</strong> A glitch gremlin that critically hits a creature with its bite or jolt attack can cause one computer, technological item, or weapon without the analog special property in the target’s possession to become broken for 1d4 rounds unless the target succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the gremlin’s level). If the broken condition would have no effect on the item, the condition instead causes the weapon to have a 20% chance of malfunctioning each round it’s turned on and each time it’s activated. When an item malfunctions, it is deactivated, cannot be used until the beginning of the user’s next turn, and produces no effect (wasting the action used to operate it).</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Support (Ex)</strong> While your glitch gremlin is adjacent to you or in your space, you gain a +2 morale bonus to Engineering checks to arm explosives and disable devices. You also gain this bonus to Computers checks to hack computers; disable modules and systems; and destroy modules and systems.</p>"
