Operatives with the disciple specialization spend as much time training their minds as they do their bodies, meditating to steel themselves against harmful magical effects. Their familiarity with magical traditions and techniques makes them especially adept at fighting spellcasters. Magical organizations, especially those with precious artifacts in need of protection, often seek out non-spellcasters with mental fortitude to train as disciples, tasking them with guarding their treasures upon the completion of their training.<br /><br /><strong>Associated Skills:</strong> @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.vCOalw5g9B79Subr]{Mysticism} and @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.CzEAY60hUMyfOC4G]{Perception}. By peering into the realms of reality that normally remain hidden, you can attempt a Mysticism check with a +4 bonus to make a trick attack; also, Mysticism is a class skill for you.<br /><strong>Specialization Exploit:</strong> @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.rh7MRpEqpfYuS7Xz]{Experiential Learning (Ex)}.<br /><strong>@Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.DMw2tuSw6BiuayMU]{Spell Resistance (Ex)}:</strong> At 11th level, you learn methods to defend yourself against a specific individual&rsquo;s magic. You can select a target you have observed for at least 1 round of combat or 5 minutes outside of combat. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level against that target for 1 minute. Once you&rsquo;ve used this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again that day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.</p>\n<p><em>Free Skill Ranks from Specialization's associated skills are auto applied in the modifiers tab</em></p>"
