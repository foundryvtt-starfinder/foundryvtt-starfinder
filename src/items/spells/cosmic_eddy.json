      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">You pull dormant mystical energy from the land and objects around you and use it to create a swirling eddy that batters your foes and can hinder their movement. The eddy deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area. Additionally, creatures in the area are knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} and are reduced to half speed while the spell is in effect. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes only half damage and is not knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}, but it is still reduced to half speed. Flying creatures within the eddy’s area must attempt an Acrobatics check to fly (DC equals the spell’s save DC) each round. Failure means the creature cannot move for that round.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The spell deals damage and knocks creatures @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} only once. However, if a creature leaves the spell’s area and then returns, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above again (and can attempt another Reflex saving throw). Similarly, if a creature is not in this spell’s area when it is first cast but later moves into it, it is subject to the damage and other effects described above.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Small, unattended items (no more than light bulk) are also thrown around in the eddy’s area. At the end of the spell’s duration, such items land in a randomly determined space within the spell’s area.</span></p>",
