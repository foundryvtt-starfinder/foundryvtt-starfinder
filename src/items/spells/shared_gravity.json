You and creatures and objects in the area treat gravity as if it were your choice of one step higher or lower, although a creature that succeeds at the saving throw is unaffected until it leaves the area and reenters. Then, the creature must repeat the saving throw. If you fail to overcome a creature&rsquo;s spell resistance, that creature is unaffected by the same casting of this spell. You can suppress or resume this affect as a reaction or swift action. While under the effects of this spell, a creature affected by forced movement can reduce the distance it moves by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet). Affected creatures ignore penalties from the off-kilter condition.</p>"
