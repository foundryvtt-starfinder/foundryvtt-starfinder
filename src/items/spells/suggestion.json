If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell’s duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p>\n<p>A very reasonable suggestion imparts a penalty (such as –1 or –2) to the target’s saving throw.</p>"
