The targets must all be within 20 feet of each other. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures, and so on. The affected targets gain a +8 bonus to their Athletics checks to swim. For each target, this casting of the spell lasts 1 round per caster level or until that target leaves the water (whichever happens first).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The 1st-level version of this spell can be cast as a reaction, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next turn.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>2nd</strong>: When you cast swim as a 2nd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and give it a swim speed of 40 feet, and the spell lasts until the creature leaves the water or for 1 minute per caster level (whichever happens first).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>3rd</strong>: When you cast swim as a 3rd-level spell, you can target one willing or unconscious touched creature and affect it as per the 2nd-level version of the spell, except the target gains a swim speed of 60 feet and the spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>4th</strong>: When you cast swim as a 4th-level spell, you can target multiple willing or unconscious creatures at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) and affect them as per the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can target one creature per caster level, all of which must be within 30 feet of each other.</span></p>"
