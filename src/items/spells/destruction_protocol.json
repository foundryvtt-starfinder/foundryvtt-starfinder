This spell must target a construct that is not already programmed or tasked with harming you. The target construct must have a CR lower than or equal to your level. If the target construct is under the control of another creature, the controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the spell’s DC) to negate this spell’s effect.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While this spell is in effect, the construct is under your control. On your turn starting when you cast this spell, you must direct it to attack a target; the construct then pursues and attacks this target as best it can. You can change which target the construct attacks as part of your concentration to continue this spell’s duration (a standard action). When you stop concentrating or when the spell’s duration otherwise ends, the construct immediately stops following your commands to attack.</span></p>"
