{"name": "Dominate Person", "type": "spell", "img": "systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/dominate_person.png", "data": {"description": {"chat": "", "gmnotes": "", "short": "", "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">You fire a bright purple ray at your target, making a ranged attack against your target&rsquo;s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If you hit and your target fails its Will saving throw, you establish a telepathic link with the target&rsquo;s mind and can control its actions. If you and the target have a common language, you can generally force the target to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stand still.&rdquo; You know what the target is experiencing, but you don&rsquo;t receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target, though it still can&rsquo;t communicate with you. You don&rsquo;t actually see through the target&rsquo;s eyes, but you still get a good idea of what&rsquo;s going on.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The target resists this control, and any target forced to take actions against its nature can attempt a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited as long as you and the target are on the same plane. You don&rsquo;t need to see the target to control it.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If you don&rsquo;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each following day, the target can attempt a new saving throw to throw off the domination. You can be prevented from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the target is under the effects of some spells, but such effects don&rsquo;t automatically dispel the domination.</span></p>", "unidentified": ""}, "source": "CRB pg. 352", "type": "", "activation": {"type": "full", "cost": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "1 day/level; see text", "units": ""}, "target": {"value": "one humanoid", "type": ""}, "area": {"value": null, "units": "none", "shape": "", "effect": ""}, "range": {"value": 25, "units": "ft", "additional": "5 ft.", "per": "2 levels"}, "uses": {"value": null, "max": null, "per": ""}, "isActive": null, "ability": "", "actionType": "rsak", "attackBonus": 0, "chatFlavor": "", "rollNotes": "", "damageNotes": "", "critical": {"parts": [], "effect": ""}, "damage": {"parts": []}, "formula": "", "save": {"type": "will", "dc": "", "descriptor": "negate"}, "descriptors": [], "modifiers": [], "level": 5, "school": "enc", "sr": true, "dismissible": false, "concentration": false, "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "preparation": {"mode": "", "prepared": false}, "allowedClasses": {"myst": true, "tech": false, "wysh": false}, "isVariableLevel": false, "abilityMods": {"parts": []}}, "effects": [], "flags": {"core": {"sourceId": "Compendium.sfrpg.spells.J14mFZezYHIGHVhO"}}, "_id": "J14mFZezYHIGHVhO"}
