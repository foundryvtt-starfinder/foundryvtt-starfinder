Those who succeed take half damage and can’t be detected with the spell’s blindsense effect. During your next turn, you can repeat this spell’s effect once without spending an action; however, the cone instead must originate from one of the creatures you can sense with the spell’s blindsense effect (and doesn’t include that creature in the spell’s area).
