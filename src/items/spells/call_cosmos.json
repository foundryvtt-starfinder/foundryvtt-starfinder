This matter is made up of bits of burning stars and chunks of frozen comets, and it deals 4d6 fire damage and 3d6 cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage occurs only once, when the spell is cast. For the spell’s remaining duration, the fallen starstuff makes the entire area difficult terrain, and thick, swirling clouds of particulate space matter magically block vision. This obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision and other vision-based senses (including vision-based blindsight and sense through), but doesn’t prevent blindsense. A creature within 5 feet of its attacker has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target). Additionally, the swirling cosmic particles are distracting to spellcasters in the area, who have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast in the area. At the end of the duration, the starstuff disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).</p>"
