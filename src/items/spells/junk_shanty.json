You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The junk you target forms into a doorway 4 feet wide and 8 feet high, which becomes the entrance to an extra-dimensional dwelling that can comfortably fit up to 8 Medium creatures. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. Only those you designate can enter the shanty. When you enter it, the portal shuts and the doorway reverts to a pile of junk. You can reform the doorway and the portal again from your side at will.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The shanty is one large room with furnishings made of scrap and debris. Despite its shabby appearance, it&rsquo;s surprisingly comfortable. Characters who take a full night&rsquo;s rest within the shanty benefit as if they underwent complete bed rest for 24 hours, recovering Hit Points and ability damage at double the usual rate. The atmosphere and temperature inside the shelter are enjoyable for your species. Since it can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the shanty, nor do conditions inside it pass beyond.</span></p>"
