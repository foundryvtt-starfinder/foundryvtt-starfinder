A beam is a vertical line, 5 feet wide, from the top of the spell’s area to the bottom, and it deals 4d8 damage to each creature in the beam. When you cast this spell and each time you concentrate on it, you can call down a damaging beam within the spell’s area. A creature in the area of a beam can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage dealt by this spell. Creatures that fail this saving throw can suffer further ill effects, as noted.</p>\n<p>When you cast this spell, select one of the following planes. You can only select a plane within one alignment step of your own. The beams gain additional effects based on the plane selected.</p>\n<p><strong>Heaven (LG)</strong>: When you choose Heaven, channel the outer sphere deals fire damage that has the lawful and good descriptors.

Good creatures in the area of a beam are immune to all damage dealt by this spell and escape from unwelcome bonds, immediately removing the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Axis (LN)</strong>: When you choose Axis, channel the outer sphere deals electricity damage that has the lawful descriptor.
