You can perform Computers checks related to that system in half the usual time.</p>\n<p>If you transfer your mind into a technological construct, you have access to its functions, allowing you to control the creature directly. You can’t cast the construct’s spells or use its spell-like or supernatural abilities. You can cast your own spells.</p>\n<p>While this spell lasts, your body falls @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.RxvbSB9ZgSCBu2jw]{Helpless}, as if you were @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}.
