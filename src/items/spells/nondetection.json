Nondetection also prevents location by magic items such as crystal balls and technological items such as cameras and surveillance systems. Casting this spell places significant stress on you, and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>If a magic divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level. If surveillance is attempted with remote cameras or sensors, the viewer must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level to see the target. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC for each these checks is equal to 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.</p>\n<p>Nondetection&nbsp;protects the target only from discovery by items and remote sensors, not by creatures. A camera mounted to a wall and monitored from a security booth is subject to&nbsp;nondetection, but a camera in a creature (including constructs) is not.</p>"
