      "value": "<p>As you cast this spell, choose a creature type; optionally, you can also choose a subtype. You modify a comm unit, causing it to broadcast an electrical signal that creatures of the chosen type find unbearable. If you also selected a subtype, the signal distresses only creatures that have both type and subtype. The signal affects a 20- foot emanation if you targeted a personal comm unit, 40 feet if you targeted a system-wide comm unit, and 100 feet if you targeted an unlimited comm unit. When a creature of the chosen type (and subtype, if appropriate) enters or begins its turn in the area, they become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened} while they remain in the area and for [[/r 1d4]] rounds after leaving (Fortitude negates). If a creature successfully saves against the sickened effect, they become immune to it for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>Any creature sickened by this spell must attempt a Will save at the beginning of each of its subsequent turns that it begins in the area. If it fails, must spend at least one move action attempting to leave the area before the end of its turn, and once it leaves the area, it cannot willingly reenter the area until it’s no longer sickened. Although these effects are compulsions, they attack creatures’ anatomy, programming, or brain chemistry directly, ignoring the protections granted by the construct immunities and undead immunities universal creature rules.</p>\n<p>This spell lasts for 10 minutes per caster level, but it quickly degrades if the comm unit is moved, reducing the remaining duration to 1 round per level.</p>"
