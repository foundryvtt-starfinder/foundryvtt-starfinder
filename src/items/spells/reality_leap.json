When you cast this spell, you state the direction you wish to travel, the distance within range, and the specific square in which you’re trying to arrive. You can bring along objects, provided their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You travel the correct direction and distance, but you have a 50% chance to arrive elsewhere than your intended square. If you do, use the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram to determine the direction you deviate from the intended destination. You arrive 1d6 squares away in that direction, although your deviation cannot cause you to exceed this spell’s range. If you arrive in a place already occupied by a solid object or body, you take 1d6 damage and are shunted to the nearest open space with a suitable surface.</p>"
