Each round at the start of their turn, the target must select one of the following benefits they gain for that round. They can’t select the same benefit on two consecutive rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Arms</em>: The target grows two additional arms, enabling them to wield and hold an additional two hands’ worth of equipment. While these additional arms increase the number of items they can carry, it doesn’t increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Legs</em>: The target grows two additional legs, granting them a +10-foot status bonus to their speed.</p>\n<p><em>Amorphous</em>: The target loses their form, becoming amorphous. They’re immune to the entangled and grappled conditions, and they don’t take double damage from critical hits.</p>\n<p><em>Damage</em> <em>Reduction</em>: The target’s skin hardens, becomes rubbery, or grows scales, granting them DR 5/— that protects against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction the target already has</p>\n<p><em>Energy Resistance</em>: The target adapts to a hazardous environment, gaining resistance 5 to one of the following damage types of their choice: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic. This energy resistance doesn’t stack with any damage resistance the target already has.</p>\n<p><em>Shrink</em>: The target shrinks by one size category (to a minimum of Tiny).</p>\n<p><em>Stretch</em>: The target’s arms elongate, increasing their reach by 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Multiple castings of fluidity of form don’t stack. Fluidity of form counters and negates physical stability.</p>"
