Each round at the start of their turn, the target must select one of the following benefits they gain for that round. They can&rsquo;t select the same benefit on two consecutive rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Arms</em>: The target grows two additional arms, enabling them to wield and hold an additional two hands&rsquo; worth of equipment. While these additional arms increase the number of items they can carry, it doesn&rsquo;t increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Legs</em>: The target grows two additional legs, granting them a +10-foot status bonus to their speed.</p>\n<p><em>Amorphous</em>: The target loses their form, becoming amorphous. They&rsquo;re immune to the entangled and grappled conditions, and they don&rsquo;t take double damage from critical hits.</p>\n<p><em>Damage</em> <em>Reduction</em>: The target&rsquo;s skin hardens, becomes rubbery, or grows scales, granting them DR 5/&mdash; that protects against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. This damage reduction doesn&rsquo;t stack with any damage reduction the target already has</p>\n<p><em>Energy Resistance</em>: The target adapts to a hazardous environment, gaining resistance 5 to one of the following damage types of their choice: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic. This energy resistance doesn&rsquo;t stack with any damage resistance the target already has.</p>\n<p><em>Shrink</em>: The target shrinks by one size category (to a minimum of Tiny).</p>\n<p><em>Stretch</em>: The target&rsquo;s arms elongate, increasing their reach by 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Multiple castings of fluidity of form don&rsquo;t stack. Fluidity of form counters and negates physical stability.</p>"
