      "value": "<p>You conjure a miniature messenger robot that appears in your space. The robot is a Tiny construct with the technological subtype. Its KAC and EAC are each equal to 10 + your caster level, it uses your saving throw modifiers, it has the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.EpLSSSdLcqVQKcSM]{evasion} ability of a 2nd-level operative, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to your caster level. It has a 30-foot land speed, a 30-foot fly speed with average maneuverability, and a Perception bonus equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p>Until given instructions, the robot remains in your space, either following you or perching on you. As a move action, you can command the robot to deliver a message or deliver an object to a place or creature of your choice. Once commanded, and each round thereafter, the robot performs two move actions to travel toward the intended target. The robot seeks the recipient based on your simple instructions and its own senses, and if it can’t find the recipient, it tries to return before the end of the spell’s duration to report its failure.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving, it plays back the message audibly (though you can choose for the robot to communicate via displayed text or sign language) or presents the object (which the recipient can take from the robot with a free hand without spending an action). The robot then lingers for 1 round, either recording a response of 10 words or less or accepting an item from the recipient, after which the robot travels back toward you and delivers that message or item. A message must be 10 words or less, though for every additional move action you spend instructing the robot, you can increase the message length by 3 words or by a number of words equal to your Intelligence modifier, whichever is greater. The robot can carry only an item of light bulk or negligible bulk.</p>\n<p><strong>1st:</strong> The robot travels a maximum distance from you equal to 100 feet plus 10 feet per caster level. Once it returns to you, the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd:</strong> The robot travels a maximum distance from you equal to 1,000 feet plus 100 feet per caster level. The spell doesn’t automatically end when the robot returns to you; you can command the robot to make a number of deliveries equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 caster levels you have before the spell ends.</p>"
