      "value": "<p>Drawing upon your own magical essence, you create a Tiny magical spirit to assist you. The spirit takes any appearance you desire, and is imbued with a fragment of your intelligence and personality, including the ability to speak any languages you know. The spirit hovers near you, sharing your space. It cannot be harmed, though it can be dispelled. Casting this spell requires intense focus and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>The spirit owes you three favors, after which the spell ends, and the spirit vanishes. You can redeem one favor from the spirit per round on your turn without spending an action. If you are unable to take actions normally at the start of your turn and redeeming a favor could help you act normally (such as with the rescue and rouse options below), the spirit redeems a favor and performs that task at the start of your turn without waiting for your instructions. Typical favors include the following, though at the GM’s discretion, the spirit might be able to perform different tasks of equivalent power.</p>\n<p><strong>Distract:</strong> The spirit draws the attention of a creature within 30 feet of you, giving it the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{flat-footed} condition against your attacks until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Encourage:</strong> The spirit provides moral support, and you regain 3d10 Stamina Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Fetch:</strong> The spirit grabs an unattended object of 1 bulk or less within 30 feet of you and places it in your hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Protect:</strong> The spirit deflects incoming attacks, granting you DR 5/— and resistance 5 against all energy types until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Rescue:</strong> If you are dying at the start of your turn, the spirit @UUID[Actor.qufvXqbBfQBh5EC1.Item.BdM0806a0yeSz5zm]{stabilizes} you as though they had succeeded at a Medicine check to provide first aid. If you spend a Resolve Point to stay in the fight before the end of your next turn, you regain 3d10 Hit Points rather than 1 Hit Point.</p>\n<p><strong>Rouse:</strong> The spirit pesters you to help you shake off certain conditions. If you are asleep or fascinated, the spirit automatically ends that condition so long as shaking or threatening you would normally end that condition. If you have failed a saving throw against an effect that makes you confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, or stunned, the spirit’s efforts allow you to attempt a new saving throw against the effect; if you succeed, you suppress those conditions until the start of your next turn.</p>"
