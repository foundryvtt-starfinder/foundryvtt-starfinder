      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you or a creature within range is subjected to a mind‑affecting effect while this spell is active, you disrupt it with the power of pure logic. Mind-affecting effects deal only half damage—including ability score damage—to creatures in the area, before any reduction due to successful saves or other effects. When a creature within the area succeeds at a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect, they are not affected by that effect, even if that effect would have a partial effect on a successful saving throw. Ongoing emotion and fear effects are also suppressed for creatures within the area.</p>",
