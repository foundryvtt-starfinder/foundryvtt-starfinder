The wall raises the light level to bright within 20 feet of it, raises the light level to normal within 20 more feet, and raises the light level one step (up to normal) within 20 more feet. A creature within 5 feet of the wall when it appears must succeed at a Reflex save or become blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 round thereafter.</p>\n<p>One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of charged particles, dealing 6d6 fire and electricity damage to creatures within 10 feet, 3d6 fire and electricity damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 1d6 fire and electricity damage to those beyond 20 feet but within 30 feet. Also, the wall sheds high radiation within 10 feet, with the radiation diminishing to medium between 10 and 20 feet, and to low between 20 and 30 feet. The wall deals its damage when it appears and on your turn each subsequent round. The wall also deals 12d6 fire and electricity damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures and any creature damaged by sunlight. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.</p>"
