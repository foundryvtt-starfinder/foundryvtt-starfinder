      "value": "<p>You move one of your memories into the target object. You can select up to 5 minutes of continuous memory, or you can select every memory associated with one person, place, or object you name when you cast this spell. If you select continuous memory, you lose those memories, and if you try to recall them, you remember a blank gap instead of any details. If you select a person, place, or object, you remember events related to that thing, but not the presence or details of the thing you named. For example, if after a visit to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} with your sister you use this spell to forget @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, you remember traveling with your sister, but you forget where you went. Alternatively, if you used this spell to forget your sister, you remember going to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} with someone, but not who was with you.</p>\n<p>Anyone touching the object into which you placed your memories can recall those memories by speaking a command word that you designate at the time of casting. Alternatively, you can designate no command word so that no one can recall the memories when touching the object. If the object is destroyed, the memories placed within return to you.</p>"
