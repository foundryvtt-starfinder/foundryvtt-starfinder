When a creature enters the area or begins their turn in the area, they must succeed at a Will saving throw or be compelled to approach the lure for 1 round. The creature isn’t compelled to move recklessly, and they typically move in a way that avoids obvious threats and hazards. If an affected creature is grappled, entangled, or otherwise unable to move toward the lure, they must use at least a move action or standard action to attempt to break free or create conditions that would help them access the lure; if this action doesn’t allow them to keep moving toward the lure, the creature can act normally for the remainder of their turn.</p>\n<p>If an affected creature ends their movement within reach of the lure, they interact with the lure, which deals 5d6 fire damage to them (Reflex half). Once a creature takes damage from the lure or succeeds at a Will save against this spell, they become immune to the spell for the remainder of its duration.</p>\n<p>You can cast this spell as a full action. If you do, you choose the type of damage the lure deals, selecting one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, slashing, or sonic.</p>"
