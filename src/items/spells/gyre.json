Each creature that enters or starts its turn in the spell’s area must attempt a Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is pulled a total of 15 feet: first, it’s pulled toward the gyre’s center; then once its space is adjacent to the gyre’s center, it’s pulled downward. A creature that succeeds at its save is pulled only 5 feet. Movement caused by gyre doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, and any portion of this spell’s area that isn’t in water has no effect.</p>"
