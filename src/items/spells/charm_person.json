It is unlikely to attempt to harm you, but it is also unlikely to attack any of its true friends or allies. You can try to give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries of this check are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. You must speak the creature’s language to communicate your suggestions, or else be good at pantomiming.</span></p>"
