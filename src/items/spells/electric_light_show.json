      "value": "<p>A favorite among SENOT students, this spell lets you create a charming electrical light show that can mimic fireworks, skywrite a message or logo, or depict anything&mdash;from birds and butterflies to a colorful dragon or starship. Once per round as a move action, including on the round you cast this spell, you can target a 5-foot-square within range and launch a spark in that direction. The spark takes a zigzag path from you to that square, missing all creatures and objects in its path, and detonating in the target square with a loud noise and a colorful burst of electricity and light. Creatures in the target square take 1d6 electricity damage and are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} for 1 round (a successful Reflex save reduces damage by half and negates the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} condition). If you attack in the same round as you launch a spark, that attack has a &ndash;4 penalty.</p>",
