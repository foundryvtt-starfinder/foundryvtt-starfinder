You must succeed at a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus to such a check (since it counts as altering your form).</p>\n<p>An unwilling target can negate the spell’s effect on it by succeeding at a Will saving throw or by relying on spell resistance. Those who interact with the targets can attempt Will saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, but spell resistance doesn’t help pierce the illusion.</p>"
