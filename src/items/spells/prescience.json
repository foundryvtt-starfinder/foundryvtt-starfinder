When that target takes an action during the duration, as a reaction you can execute one of the following effects. These effects are resolved after the target declares an intended action but before that action is resolved. The target can attempt a Reflex save to negate your reaction’s effect. If the effect successfully interrupts the target’s action, that action is still expended unless otherwise noted. Once a target has been successfully affected three times by one casting of this spell, the spell ends. You can attempt each effect only once per casting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trip the target. A target tripped after it declares its intent to cast a spell does not lose that spell slot.</li>\n<li>Hinder the target’s ranged weapon, imposing a –4 penalty on its next ranged attack roll or a –2 penalty to multiple ranged attack rolls during a full attack.</li>\n<li>Wrench the target’s weapon-wielding appendage, imposing a –4 penalty on its next melee attack roll or a –2 penalty on multiple melee attack rolls during a full attack.</li>\n<li>Short out an item—whether magic, hybrid, or technological—wasting the target’s declared action to activate that item.</li>\n<li>Jam a weapon or weapon-like object in place as the target attempts to draw or sheathe it, thwarting that attempt.</li>\n<li>Cause the target to fumble with ammunition, wasting its declared action to reload a weapon.</li>\n<li>Unleash a blast of force from eddying realities, causing the foe to waste its declared action to stand up from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}.</li>\n</ul>"
