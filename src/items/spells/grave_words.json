The corpse utters random sentences for 1 round, with a 10% chance this information is of some use to you. Useful information might include warnings about dangers in a wrecked starship, the password to unlock a computer, or the name of a supernatural creature seeking you or your allies. The GM makes the d% roll in secret and decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.</p>\n<p>Once a corpse has been subjected to&nbsp;grave words&nbsp;by any caster, any new attempt to cast&nbsp;grave words&nbsp;on that corpse fails. A corpse must have a mouth or means to speak in order for this spell to function, and the spell doesn’t affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.</p>"
