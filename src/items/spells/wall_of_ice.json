      "value": "<p>An icy barrier, your choice of a plane or hemisphere, springs into existence. A plane can be oriented in any fashion, provided it&rsquo;s anchored. If vertical, the wall needs only a solid foundation; a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. A hemisphere must have a solid foundation. Either form can fit into any space of surrounding nonliving material if it has sufficient area to do so. An ice wall fails to manifest in any area already occupied by a creature or object or where it will likely fall or collapse. The hemisphere version fails to manifest if it can&rsquo;t entirely contain a creature or object occupying the same space. Each 10-foot section of ice has 0 hardness and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Fire deals full damage to a wall of ice. A section of wall is breached if reduced to 0 Hit Points. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20.</p>\n<p>For the duration, even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature passing through such a breach takes 4d4 cold damage.</p>\n<p>Once the duration elapses, the ice might remain if environmental conditions prevent it from melting. However, no magic maintains the ice, and a creature passing through a breach in the wall takes no cold damage.</p>"
