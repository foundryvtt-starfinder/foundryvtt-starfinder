Each target gains the&nbsp; Mind-Swapped template graft. You can maintain the swap at any range on the same plane. You can shift back to your body as a standard action, and doing so ends the spell. If your new body is killed, you return to your body and the target dies. If your body is killed, you can remain in the host’s body for the duration or until it is killed. Then, you die if your body is still @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}. However, if you recast this spell, you can reset the duration you remain in the target’s body. You can cast this spell from a body that is not your own, swapping minds with a new target and resetting the spell’s duration. However, you can return only to your body.</p>\n<p>If a creature saves against your casting of this spell, it is immune to your casting of this spell for 24 hours.</p>"
