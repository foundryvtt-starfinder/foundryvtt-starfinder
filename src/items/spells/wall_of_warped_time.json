      "value": "<p>You create a faint vertical field that warps time and space. The wall is insubstantial, remains in place once created, and doesn’t need to anchor to a surface. Creatures and objects on one side of the wall have concealment (20% miss chance) from creatures on the opposite side of the wall; however, this concealment is caused by how the wall distorts light, sound, and other stimuli, such that abilities like blindsight do not negate the effect. The wall tangles the personal timestream of anyone that moves through it, causing one of the randomly determined effects below. A creature can attempt a Fortitude save against most of the effects, with a success negating detrimental effects or enhancing beneficial effects. Once a creature has passed through the wall, they are not subject to additional effects from moving through the wall additional times, whether they succeeded at the saving throw or not.</p>\n<p>D10 - TIME DISTORTION</p>\n<p>1-2 - No effect.</p>\n<p>3–4 - Gains the effects of haste until the end of their next turn. The duration increases by 1d4 rounds with a successful Fortitude save.</p>\n<p>5–6 - Gains the effects of slow for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude negates).</p>\n<p>7–8 - Gains the nauseated condition for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude negates).</p>\n<p>9–10 - Paralyzed for 1d4 rounds immediately after passing through the wall (Fortitude negates). At the end of each of its turns, the creature can attempt a new Fort save, ending the effect if it succeeds.</p>"
