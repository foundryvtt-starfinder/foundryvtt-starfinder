The target weapons must deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage or the spell has no effect. For the spell’s duration, the metal plating on the weapons grants them the ability to overcome DR/silver and bypass DR/magic for the spell’s duration.<br><br>If your caster level is 8th or higher, you can have weapons affected by this spell bypass DR/adamantine rather than DR/ silver. Weapons affected by this version of the spell are not considered adamantine for any other purpose (such as the ability to bypass hardness). If your caster level is 16th or higher, you can instead have affected weapons bypass DR that is bypassed by any other one metal with which you are familiar (either from having succeeded at a skill check to identify the weaknesses of a creature with DR, or from a successful Physical Science skill check to identify some other metal when you encountered it). Such weapons do not gain any other benefit from being made of the selected material.</p>"
