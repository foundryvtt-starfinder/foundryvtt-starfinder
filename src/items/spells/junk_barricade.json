The barricade grants cover against attacks with a line of effect that pass through it. The barricade has hardness and Hit Points as a piece of equipment with an item level equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p>You can target 1 additional bulk of inert electronic equipment for every 4 caster levels you have beyond 4th, extending the barricade across an equal number of adjacent squares. Alternatively, for each additional bulk you can target, you can increase the bonuses to AC and Reflex saves provided by one square of the barricade by 1 (to a maximum of improved coverâ€”+8 bonus to AC and +4 bonus to Reflex saves).</p>"
