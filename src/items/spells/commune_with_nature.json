You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of native creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or general state of the natural setting.</p>\n<p>In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings—caves, caverns, and the like—the spell is less powerful and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlements, such as in cities, factories, and starships.</p>"
