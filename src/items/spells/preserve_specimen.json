The creature cannot attack, use any abilities, or move while affected by&nbsp;preserve specimen, nor does the creature age or change in any way. It is not aware of its surroundings and does not experience any sensation or passage of time. If the creature was affected by any diseases, poisons, or other afflictions or conditions before you cast&nbsp;preserve specimen, they cease to progress for the duration of the spell, but the creature retains them. Their progression resumes once the spell ends. Any attack against a creature affected by&nbsp;preserve specimen, or any spell or effect that would cause the specimen to take damage or attempt a saving throw, immediately ends this spell.</p>",
