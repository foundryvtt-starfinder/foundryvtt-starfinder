The first option is to restore an extra 5d8 Hit Points with a 4th-level necromantic revitalization spell, an extra 7d8 Hit Points with a 5th-level necromantic revitalization spell, or an extra 9d8 Hit Points with a 6th-level necromantic revitalization spell. The second option is to restore a target that was destroyed within the past 2 rounds, bringing it back to its undead state with the number of Hit Points that would otherwise be restored by this spell. This spell can&rsquo;t reanimate creatures that were destroyed by effects that specifically target or have a special effect against the undead (such as wall of fire) or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated, disintegrated, or otherwise obliterated. It also cannot restore an undead creature whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite&rsquo;s electroencephalon) if that object has been destroyed.</p>\n<p>Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
