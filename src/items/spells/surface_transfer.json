      "value": "<p>As a move action while this spell is active, you can physically meld with a solid, physical surface you’re in direct contact with and emerge from another solid surface within 30 feet to which you have line of sight from the point you entered. Any surface you enter or emerge from must be made of physical material (not a force field) and be at least your approximate size (such as a 5-foot-square surface if you are Medium). You can emerge from a surface that wouldn’t otherwise support you (such as emerging from a ceiling), but this spell doesn’t prevent you from falling after you emerge unless you have some other means of remaining on the surface. This spell also does not enable you to emerge from a different side of the surface you enter, such as merging with a wall and appearing on the wall’s other side.</p>\n<p>Each time you meld with and emerge from surfaces, this spell’s remaining duration decreases by 1 round. If you end your turn and are not in direct contact with a solid surface, this spell ends.</p>"
