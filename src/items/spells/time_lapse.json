      "value": "<p>You push an object forward or backward through time. When you cast the spell and each subsequent round that you concentrate, you either increase or decrease the target’s age by 1 day. This doesn’t change the object’s position, nor does it undo or inflict damage or effects that might have affected the object or might soon affect it. For durable objects, altering the age typically just removes some rust, brightens its paint, or applies similar cosmetic adjustments; at the GM’s discretion, this might reduce skill check penalties or skill check DCs made to operate the object by 1 if the object’s decayed state makes it harder to use. The spell has a more substantial effect on organic or perishable objects, such as removing natural spoilage from a piece of food or causing a seed to sprout. This spell’s effects are permanent, though they can be negated by casting time lapse on the object a second time. An object’s age can only be changed and reversed by this spell once, after which it becomes immune to time lapse.</p>\n<p>You can spend 1 Resolve Point when casting this spell to affect the target’s age more dramatically, increasing or decreasing its age by 1d4 days each round instead of 1 day per round. This typically just causes more dramatic changes to the object’s appearance rather than granting special bonuses or advantages.</p>"
