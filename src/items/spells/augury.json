Casting this spell takes intense personal focus and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.</p>\n<p>The chance for successfully receiving a meaningful reply is 75%; this roll is made secretly by the GM. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or it may be so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li>\n<li>Woe (for bad results).</li>\n<li>Weal and woe (for both).</li>\n<li>Nothing (for actions that have neither especially good nor especially bad results).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp; If the augury isn’t successful, you get the “nothing” result. A spellcaster who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.</p>\n<p>The augury can see only about 30 minutes into the future, so anything that might happen beyond that time frame does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. Multiple castings of <em>augury</em> by the same creature about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting.</p>"
