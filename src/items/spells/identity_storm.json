At the start of each of each affected creature’s turn, that creature chooses to treat all other creatures it can perceive as allies or enemies. The creature must attempt attacks of opportunity whenever any enemy provokes them and can’t target allies (or squares containing allies) with harmful effects. Any affected creature that’s attacked immediately treats all other creatures as enemies. Any affected creature targeted with a beneficial effect immediately treats all other creatures as friends. An affected creature can spend a move action to attempt a Will Save to end the effect.</p><h3>SHULGI SPELLS</h3><p>Residents of Shulgi Station and Junval have developed unique spells to leverage their home’s astral and psychic resources. Through the unique properties of their home, some have developed these spells innately, while others have trained under veterans. These spells play off the psychic energies within the settlement, though they’re sometimes found developed independently by other cultures across the cosmos.</p>"
