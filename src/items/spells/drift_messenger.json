The iridia is indifferent to you and will take no other action on your behalf; it remains within range of you for 1 minute, during which time you can communicate your message to it, transmit a data file to it by means of a comm, or give it a physical object no larger than 2 bulk. You must identify the recipient of your message by name and provide that recipient&rsquo;s location.</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once it has your message, is targeted by any hostile effect, or the duration of the spell expires (whichever comes first), the iridia vanishes and moves through the Drift to the named location, traveling at the speed of a starship with a Drift engine rating of 1. When it arrives at the location you&rsquo;ve provided, it attempts to deliver whatever you told or gave it to the individual you named. If it fails to find that individual, it abandons your message. No information regarding the success or failure to deliver your message is provided by this spell.</span> </p>"
