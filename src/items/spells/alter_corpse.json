This spell can hide or create clues about how the corpse ended up in its current state, from closing wounds to evaporating chemicals in the cadaver&rsquo;s system. However, the changes cannot be major, such as removing or restoring a limb, or stripping flesh from the skeleton. The spell is also unable to change the corpse&rsquo;s identity.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Anyone who examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse&rsquo;s condition (or lack thereof) seems manipulated, but success doesn&rsquo;t allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast. Closely examining the corpse with a successful Medicine check (DC = 15 + your caster level) not only reveals what a successful Perception check does, but also reveals what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.&nbsp;</span></p>"
