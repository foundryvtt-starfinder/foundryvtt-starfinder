The sensor appears at any point within line of sight, but it can then travel beyond your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a humanoid would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The arcane eye sees exactly as you would see if you were there.</p>\n<p>The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The arcane eye canâ€™t enter another plane of existence, even through Drift travel or a magical gate or similar magical portal.</p>\n<p>You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the sensor is inert until you concentrate again.</p>"
