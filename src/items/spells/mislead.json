      "value": "<p>You become invisible (as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.ydYnaedLHnVbrZHI]{Invisibility, Greater}), and at the same time, a figment double of you (as per a 3rd-level casting of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.kDFNOMx78KU1GGol]{Holographic Image}) appears. The double appears within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don’t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it can’t attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.</p>\n<p>The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.ydYnaedLHnVbrZHI]{Invisibility, Greater}</h2>\n<p>This spell functions like @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.YDXegEus8p0BnsH1]{Invisibility}, except it doesn’t end if the target attacks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.YDXegEus8p0BnsH1]{Invisibility}</h2>\n<p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible (see page 264). If the target is a creature, any gear it is carrying vanishes as well. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the target unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p>\n<p>The spell ends if the target attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell or harmful effect targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unattended objects don’t break the spell. Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps, and so forth.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.kDFNOMx78KU1GGol]{Holographic Image}</h2>\n<p>You weave nearby photons into illusory holograms that can take almost any form you can imagine. These holograms are usually effective against cameras, robots, and living creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>1st</strong>: When you cast holographic image as a 1st-level spell, it produces a purely visual hologram at long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level). The image has no sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The image can’t extend beyond four 10-foot cubes plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd</strong>: When you cast holographic image as a 2nd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include minor sounds, but not understandable speech. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 2 additional rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd</strong>: When you cast&nbsp;holographic image&nbsp;as a 3rd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include sound, smell, and thermal illusions (but not speech). The image disappears when it is struck by an opponent, unless you cause the hologram to react appropriately. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 3 additional rounds.</p>"
