      "value": "<p>You can use <em>dispel magic</em> to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by <em>dispel magic</em>.<em>Dispel magic</em> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled.</p>\n<p>You choose to use <em>dispel magic</em> in one of two ways: as a targeted dispel or as a counter.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Dispel</strong>: One creature, object, or spell is the target of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as <em>zone of truth</em>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as “that burning wall” or “the spell that’s giving him those duplicates”). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed, the spell ends. If you don’t specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random.</p>\n<p>If you target a force, an object, or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant), you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n<p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item’s nonmagical physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed <em>holy laser pistol</em> is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n<p>You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Counter</strong>: You can use the energy of <em>dispel magic</em> to disrupt the casting of other spells. First, select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast <em>dispel magic</em> when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered, you cast <em>dispel magic</em> and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster’s spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster’s caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range, the spell fails and has no result.</p>"
