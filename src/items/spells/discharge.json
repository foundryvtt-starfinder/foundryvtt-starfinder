If the spell targets an object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the technological subtype, it affects a random charged or electrically powered item in that creatureâ€™s possession. If the target is a construct with the technological subtype, it is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered} and cannot use any energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A construct with the technological subtype that is affected by this spell can attempt a Fortitude saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect.</p>"
