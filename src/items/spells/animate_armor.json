      "value": "<p>You temporarily infuse a suit of armor with a magic force that allows it to move on its own and that directs its mechanisms. When you cast this spell, the armor acts and responds to your mental control for as long as you concentrate. Each round on your turn, the armor can perform either a move action or a standard action to attack. The armor can move up to 30 feet (or its listed speed using any of its available modes of movement, if powered armor or containing an armor upgrade that alters movement). When the armor attacks, it can either make an unarmed attack, dealing 4d8 + your caster level bludgeoning damage (or the listed damage plus its Strength modifier, for powered armor) or make an attack with any of the weapons mounted in its weapon slots or weapons with the integrated special property installed in its upgrade slots (if any); this deals the weapon’s base damage for ranged attacks and the weapon’s base damage plus the armor’s Strength modifier for melee attacks. The armor has a bonus to attacks equal to 6 + your caster level. If the armor has no listed Strength score, it can apply a Strength bonus equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p>Should the animated armor be attacked, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + the EAC and KAC bonus the armor provides. It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects, and it has the typical hardness and Hit Points for an item of its level. For the purpose of spells and effects that target the armor, it is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes while the spell lasts.</p>\n<p>This spell has no effect if cast on powered armor with a depleted battery or powered armor of an item level that exceeds your caster level.</p>"
