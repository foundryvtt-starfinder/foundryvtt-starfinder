All movement must occur at the same time.</p>\n<p>All of the hasted creature’s modes of movement (including base, burrow, climb, fly, and swim speeds) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the target’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
