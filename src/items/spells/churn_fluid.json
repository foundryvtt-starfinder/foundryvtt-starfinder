You can target any type of fluid, and you need not know its current composition. You must be able to see the liquid or the receptacle that holds it, or this spell fails and is lost. You must also target an entire body of fluid, rather than only part of it. If you target an amount of fluid that is too large for you to change entirely, the spell fails and is lost.<br>When you target fluid in this way, you can turn it into potable water, salt water, mildly corrosive acid or base, blood, or any other nontoxic, non-damaging fluid with no other game effects. After 1 day, if unused in its changed state, the fluid reverts to its original state. In so doing, the reverting fluid cannot cause harm.&nbsp;</span></p>"
