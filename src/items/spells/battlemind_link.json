This spell works like @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.f4gAnmQFu9vQvFSq]{Battlemind Link, Lesser}, but the enhancement bonus to initiative rolls is +4, and the spell ends if the targets are more than 500 feet apart, rather than 200 feet apart. In addition, if the targets threaten the same enemy, they are considered to be flanking that foe regardless of their actual positions. When one of the targets hits a foe with a ranged attack, they can, as a reaction, apply the effects of covering fire or harrying fire against that foe for the other target of this spell. Finally, each target gains a +4 enhancement bonus to attacks of opportunity if they both attack the same creature due to the same triggering action on that creature’s part.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.f4gAnmQFu9vQvFSq]{Battlemind Link, Lesser}</h2>\n<p>You form a temporary psychic link between two creatures that allows them to act almost as one. While this spell is active, the two targets each roll initiative in combat and use the higher die result between them before adding modifiers. This spells also grants each target a +2 enhancement bonus to initiative rolls. This spell ends if the targets are ever more than 200 feet apart or if either target is unconscious or helpless.&nbsp;</p>"
