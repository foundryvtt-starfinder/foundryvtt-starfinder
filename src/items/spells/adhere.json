Pulling the object free of that surface then requires a Strength check against the spell’s save DC, although you can dismiss it by touching the object again. If moving or opening the object already requires a Strength check, you increase the DC of that check by half your key ability score bonus. If the adherence is broken, the spell ends. Otherwise, the magic is permanent.</p>\n<p>If you instead touch a surface (one 5-foot square), that surface becomes charged with adhering magic for 1 round per level. If a creature touches the surface of the affected square, the creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} until they successfully save against the spell (they can attempt a new save at the beginning of each of their turns). Once the entangled creature escapes, the spell ends. It also ends if you cast this version of the spell on another area.</p>"
