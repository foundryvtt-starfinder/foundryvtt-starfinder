When you cast this spell, choose one of the following distances: travel in-system, travel to Absalom station, travel to Near Space, or travel to the Vast. Make a DC 20 caster level check (1d20 + your caster level). If you succeed, make any necessary random rolls related to the Drift journey you predicted, such as the duration and the chance of a random encounter in the Drift. If the starship initiates Drift travel of</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">the distance you predicted before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, apply those rolls to the journey. This spell doesn&rsquo;t allow you to anticipate any extra time the starship might spend on its journey, such as if it stops to explore or engage in starship combat, and you can&rsquo;t anticipate whether the ship will complete its journey or stop for some reason, such as to exit the Drift early, or because it was destroyed.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Casting this spell requires access to a computer or similar device, which displays the information gained. Additionally, casting this spell places considerable strain on you, requiring you to spend 1 Resolve Point.</span> </p>"
