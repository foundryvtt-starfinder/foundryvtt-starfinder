The target must attempt a Will save; on a failure, it begins whispering incoherently and moves half its speed in a random direction. On its turn, it does nothing except whisper incoherently and move half its speed in a random direction. When it moves, the target takes the safest route and doesn’t enter hazardous terrain. If the target is attacked, the spell ends immediately.</p>\n<p>Creatures that begin their turn within 20 feet of the target and can hear it whispering must succeed at a Will saving throw or become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8rIj0ewW4bL8Uph5]{Confused} for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the whispers until the spell ends.</p>"
