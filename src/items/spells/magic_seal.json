This seal has no effect on non-spell capabilities of magic items, spells already ongoing, abilities that affect only the targeted creature (such as the supernatural ability to fly), spells with a range of personal (except when that magic is then used on another), or any spells with which the creature targets only itself. While this spell lasts, the first time during any round that the targeted creature uses a restricted ability or attempts to affect a target other than itself with such magic, attempt a dispel check (11 + your caster level). This check requires neither your awareness nor presence, nor any action on your part. The DC equals 11 + the creature’s caster level, or the creature’s level or CR for supernatural abilities. If you succeed, the affected magic has no effect. The action the targeted creature used in the attempt is lost. This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.</p>"
