Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.</p>\n<p>While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy powerful enough to restrain a Large or smaller creature. The junk flies toward the creature and attaches itself to the creature’s limbs or otherwise ensnares it, causing it to gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition for the duration of the spell or until it ends the condition by succeeding at an Acrobatics check to escape as a move action. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × your caster level.</p>\n<p>If the targeted creature succeeds at a Reflex save, the junk lands adjacent to them harmlessly.</p>"
