      "value": "<p>This spell functions like&nbsp;invisibility, except it doesn&rsquo;t end if the target attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisibility</h2>\n<p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible (see page 264). If the target is a creature, any gear it is carrying vanishes as well. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the target unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.<br /><br />The spell ends if the target attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell or harmful effect targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unattended objects don&rsquo;t break the spell. Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon security forces and have them attack, start a trash compactor with foes inside, remotely trigger traps, and so forth.</p>",
