Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 piercing damage, although you can allow anyone to touch you without them taking damage, for instance to deliver a beneficial touch spell. As a move action, you cause the nanites to cling tightly to you, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability as an extraordinary ability. When using the shroud to fly, you have no concealment due to it, and it cannot harm creatures that successfully attack you in melee. You can return the nanites to their protective configuration as a move action.</p>"
