      "value": "<p>Formulated in conjunction with shimmerstone-induced meditation, kothama favor the use of this spell to contemplate the past. Through an intense meditative trance, you peer into the past and experience a glimpse of historical events that occurred surrounding a specific event, object, person, or place. Casting this spell requires you to expend 1 Resolve Point, and you must declare the focus of your remembrance when you cast the spell. The information granted by this spell can be as simple as a series of images in your mind, or it might take the form of a cryptic message. The chance for a correct remembrance is 75% for events that occurred within the past 50 years, 60% for events that occurred between 51 and 150 years ago, and 45% for events that occurred between 151 years ago and the Gap. Attempts to glean information from during the Gap or earlier automatically fail. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.</p>\n<p>Unlike @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.APgLb0BS0VgtE06l]{Divination}, multiple castings of remembrance about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as the first remembrance spell but yield different pieces of information each time.</p>"
