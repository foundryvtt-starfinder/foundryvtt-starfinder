      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl01_LabelName\">This spell functions like <em>command</em>, except you can affect up to one creature per level and the targets continue the specified activity beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature&rsquo;s action after the first, it can attempt another Will saving throw to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Command</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">You give the target one of the following commands, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. If the target can&rsquo;t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Approach</strong>: The target moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round, taking no other actions and triggering reactions (such as attacks of opportunity) for this movement as normal.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Drop</strong>: The target drops whatever it is holding. It can&rsquo;t pick up any dropped item until its next turn.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Fall</strong>: The target falls to the ground and remains @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} for 1 round. It can otherwise act normally.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Flee</strong>: The target moves away from you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round, taking no other actions and provoking reactions (such as attacks of opportunity) for this movement as normal.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Halt</strong>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</span></p>",
