      "value": "<p>You pull latent technological energy from the air to form a cloud of fist-sized hindering microbots that fill an area you designate. The microbots begin in a 10-foot-square area when you create them, and you can create the cloud so that it shares the space of other creatures. If no creatures are within the cloudâ€™s area, the microbots pursue and harass the nearest creature that is hostile to you as best they can each round. Although the microbots generally know which creatures are your enemies, you have no control over their targets or direction of travel. If there are multiple valid targets the microbots can harass, the cloud will split into a maximum of four 5-foot-square segments and pursue different targets.</p>\n<p>The cloud (and any segments thereof) has a fly speed of 20 feet. Each round on your turn, the microbot cloud grants harrying fire (see page 247) against the foes in its spaces. In addition, the cloud grants covering fire (see page 246) to anyone attacked by foes in its spaces. The microbots constantly repair themselves and the cloud generates new microbots every few seconds, so any attack against them is essentially ineffective.</p>"
