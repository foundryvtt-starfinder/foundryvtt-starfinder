You do not take double damage from critical hits, but critical hit effects apply against you normally. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your KAC against the grapple and reposition combat maneuvers. You can move through an area as small as one-quarter of your space without squeezing, or one-eighth your space when squeezing.</p>\n<p>To benefit from this spell, you must have the shapechanger subtype or be benefiting from a polymorph effect. You can cast this spell as a reaction when you are attacked by a grapple or reposition maneuver or hit by a critical hit, but when you do, you can’t take a standard action on your next turn.</p>"
