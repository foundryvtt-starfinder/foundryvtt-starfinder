On its next turn in the initiative order, the corpse stands up (if applicable; this does not require a move action), can take a single move action to move up to its speed, and makes a single attack using the weapons and bonuses it had when alive (though it can’t use class features, spell-like abilities, or spells). You can choose the target of the affected creature’s attack or allow the target corpse to select a target entirely at random. If the target of this spell was friendly or helpful toward you in life, the spell works automatically; otherwise, the corpse can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this spell, as if the creature were still alive.</p>\n<p>After making its attack, the creature that you have targeted with&nbsp;viral destruction&nbsp;falls and is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} as normal. However, if this attack kills the affected creature’s target or if it knocks it unconscious, that target must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the spell’s DC) or be subject to&nbsp;viral destruction&nbsp;and make a single attack on its next turn before returning to its normal @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} or unconscious state. If the secondary target of&nbsp;viral destruction&nbsp;is merely unconscious and becomes conscious again before its next action, that creature is freed from the&nbsp;viral destruction&nbsp;effect and the spell ends. Each attack caused by this spell can transfer the&nbsp;viral destruction&nbsp;effect to its target if that target is knocked unconscious or killed by the attack, until the spell has affected a number of creatures equal to your mystic level.</p>"
