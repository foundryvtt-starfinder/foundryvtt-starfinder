Once during the spell’s duration, you can center yourself as a standard action (this is a purely mental action) to remember your time spent scrutinizing the flame, choosing one of the benefits below. When the chosen effect ends, so does the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Clarity:</strong> At some point during the next 10 minutes, you can reroll one skill check with a +4 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Clarity:</strong> You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to EAC and KAC until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritual Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;You can immediately attempt a new saving throw against any mind-affecting effect currently affecting you.</p>"
