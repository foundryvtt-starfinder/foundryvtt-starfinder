During the spell&rsquo;s duration, you can pilot the vehicle as if you were in it, except you can use your Mysticism skill to pilot the vehicle in place of Piloting. As long as you remotely pilot the vehicle, the vehicle is considered controlled. This spell ends if you lose sight of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Uncontrolled and unsecured vehicles are automatically affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect a controlled vehicle, the pilot can attempt a Piloting check with a DC equal to 11 + your caster level to negate the effect. Each round a creature within the vehicle attempts to pilot or take control of the vehicle, they must attempt a Piloting check opposed by your Mysticism check. On a success, they take control of the vehicle, otherwise, you retain control.</p>"
