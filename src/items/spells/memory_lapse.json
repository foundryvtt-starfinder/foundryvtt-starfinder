      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You inspire a moment of confusion that causes a creature to forget what occurred over the last round if it fails its saving throw. If you have failed a skill check against that target since the beginning of your last turn, you can attempt that check again without a penalty (if you have the appropriate number of actions remaining), or simply avoid the normal consequences of that failed skill check. If the target was in the middle of a task that requires longer than a single round to accomplish, it must begin again. If you target a creature casting a spell with a casting time of 1 round or longer, they must attempt a second Will save to continue casting the spell or the spell fails.<br>A creature you have injured in the last hour gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Will saving throw.</p>",
