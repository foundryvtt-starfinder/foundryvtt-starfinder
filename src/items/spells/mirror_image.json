      "value": "<p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.</p>\n<p>When you cast mirror image, it creates [[/r 1d4]] figment images. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image. Area spells and effects that don’t require an attack roll affect you normally and don’t destroy any of your figments. Spells with a range of touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</p>\n<p>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect. Blindsense doesn’t help distinguish the figments from the real you, but blindsight is sufficient to do so.</p>"
