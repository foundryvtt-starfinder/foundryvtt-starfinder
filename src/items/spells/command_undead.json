If the target is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">An unintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as \u201cCome here,\u201d \u201cGo there,\u201d \u201cFight,\u201d \u201cStand still,\u201d and so on. Unintelligent undead won\u2019t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell. You command the undead creature by voice and it understands you, no matter what language you speak.</span></p>"
