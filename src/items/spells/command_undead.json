It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the target suggestions, but you must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful suggestions, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.</p>\n<p>An unintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” “Stand still,” and so on. Unintelligent undead won’t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.</p>\n<p>Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell. You command the undead creature by voice and it understands you, no matter what language you speak.</p>"
