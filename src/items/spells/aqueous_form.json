Also for 1 round, you reduce the amount of bludgeoning, slashing, and fire damage you take by an amount equal to half your caster level (this reduction doesn&rsquo;t stack with DR or resistances you might already have), and you gain vulnerability to electricity.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>3rd</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 3rd-level spell, you&rsquo;re affected as per the 2nd-level version except the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against combat maneuvers while you&rsquo;re completely submerged in water.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>4th</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 4th-level spell, you&rsquo;re affected as per the 3rd-level version except the spell lasts 10 minutes per caster level, and you gain concealment while you&rsquo;re completely submerged in water.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>5th</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 5th-level spell, you&rsquo;re affected as per the 4th-level version except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. You can cast the 5th-level version of aqueous form as a purely defensive reaction when you&rsquo;re about to take damage, but when you do so, you can&rsquo;t take a standard action on your next turn.</span></p>"
