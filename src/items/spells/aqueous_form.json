Also for 1 round, you reduce the amount of bludgeoning, slashing, and fire damage you take by an amount equal to half your caster level (this reduction doesn’t stack with DR or resistances you might already have), and you gain vulnerability to electricity.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 3rd-level spell, you’re affected as per the 2nd-level version except the spell lasts 1 minute per caster level. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against combat maneuvers while you’re completely submerged in water.</p>\n<p><strong>4th</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 4th-level spell, you’re affected as per the 3rd-level version except the spell lasts 10 minutes per caster level, and you gain concealment while you’re completely submerged in water.</p>\n<p><strong>5th</strong>: When you cast aqueous form as a 5th-level spell, you’re affected as per the 4th-level version except the spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level. You can cast the 5th-level version of aqueous form as a purely defensive reaction when you’re about to take damage, but when you do so, you can’t take a standard action on your next turn.</p>"
