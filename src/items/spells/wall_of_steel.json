      "value": "<p>You cause a flat, vertical steel wall to spring into existence. The stress of casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. The wall can fit into any space of surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can&rsquo;t be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.</p>\n<p>A wall of steel is 4 inches thick. You can double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 15 and 45 Hit Points per inch of thickness. A section of wall that is reduced to 0 Hit Points is breached. The DC of the Strength check for a creature to break through the wall with a single attack is 30. The wall is firmly anchored to its surroundings, and it doesn&rsquo;t easily tip over; it can&rsquo;t be summoned into any area where it is likely to fall or collapse.</p>\n<p>Like any steel wall, this wall is subject to perforation and other natural phenomena, though it doesn&rsquo;t rust or corrode under typical circumstances. The metal created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and can&rsquo;t be sold.</p>"
