This is an instantaneous effect.</p>\n<p>You can employ entropic grasp in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent’s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor’s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor’s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.</p>\n<p>Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.</p>\n<p>Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.</p>\n<p>Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
