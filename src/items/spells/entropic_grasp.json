      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any unattended, manufactured (built from component parts, including metal, wood, plastic, glass, and so on) item you touch crumbles into dust, rust, and decay. If the item is so large that it can’t fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the material is destroyed. This is an instantaneous effect.<br><br>You can employ&nbsp;entropic grasp&nbsp;in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent’s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor’s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor’s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.<br><br>Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.<br><br>Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.<br><br>Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>",
