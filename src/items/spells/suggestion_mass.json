All of the affected creatures are subject to the same suggestion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Suggestion</h2>\n<p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.<br /><br />The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration of the spell. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell&rsquo;s duration expires, the activity is not performed.<br /><br />A very reasonable suggestion imparts a penalty (such as &ndash;1 or &ndash;2) to the target&rsquo;s saving throw.</p>"
