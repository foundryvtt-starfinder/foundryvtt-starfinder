The blindsense can be based on scent or sound rather than vibration. If the creature has an existing sense that’s tied to the blindsense—such as touch (vibration), smell (scent), or hearing (sound)—and it’s suppressed, the blindsense is suppressed for the same duration. This spell lasts 1 hour/level.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast extra sense as a 2nd-level spell, the target can emit a piercing sound and, by listening to the echoes, gain blindsight (sound) with a range of 20 feet and blindsense (sound) with a range of 40 feet for 1 round. The sound emitted is audible to others in the 40-foot area, and the target emits the sound as if it were part of combat banter (Core Rulebook 249). The target can decide not to emit the sound but doesn’t gain the benefits this spell grants until they do so. This spell lasts 10 minutes/level.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast extra sense as a 3rd-level spell, it functions as the 1st-level version, except the range of the blindsense extends to 60 feet, the target gains blindsight (of the same type as the blindsense) with a range of 30 feet, and the spell lasts 10 minutes/level.</p>"
