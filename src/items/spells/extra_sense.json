The blindsense can be based on scent or sound rather than vibration. If the creature has an existing sense that&rsquo;s tied to the blindsense&mdash;such as touch (vibration), smell (scent), or hearing (sound)&mdash;and it&rsquo;s suppressed, the blindsense is suppressed for the same duration. This spell lasts 1 hour/level.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast extra sense as a 2nd-level spell, the target can emit a piercing sound and, by listening to the echoes, gain blindsight (sound) with a range of 20 feet and blindsense (sound) with a range of 40 feet for 1 round. The sound emitted is audible to others in the 40-foot area, and the target emits the sound as if it were part of combat banter (Core Rulebook 249). The target can decide not to emit the sound but doesn&rsquo;t gain the benefits this spell grants until they do so. This spell lasts 10 minutes/level.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast extra sense as a 3rd-level spell, it functions as the 1st-level version, except the range of the blindsense extends to 60 feet, the target gains blindsight (of the same type as the blindsense) with a range of 30 feet, and the spell lasts 10 minutes/level.</span></p>"
