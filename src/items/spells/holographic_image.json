      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You weave nearby photons into illusory holograms that can take almost any form you can imagine. These holograms are usually effective against cameras, robots, and living creatures.<br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1st:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 1st-level spell, it produces a purely visual hologram at long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level). The image has no sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The image can&rsquo;t extend beyond four 10-foot cubes plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2nd:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 2nd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include minor sounds, but not understandable speech. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 2 additional rounds.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3rd:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 3rd-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 1st-level version of the spell, except the hologram can include sound, smell, and thermal illusions (but not speech). The image disappears when it is struck by an opponent, unless you cause the hologram to react appropriately. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 3 additional rounds.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 4th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the hologram follows a script determined by you. It follows that script for 1 minute per level without you having to concentrate on it. The hologram can include intelligible speech, if you wish.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 5th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the size of the hologram can&rsquo;t extend beyond a 20-foot cube plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. You can choose to make the hologram permanent at the time of casting. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating. Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger. The trigger can&rsquo;t be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. The spell lasts until it is triggered, and then the hologram lasts for 1 round per caster level.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 6th-level spell, it creates a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself at medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). This hologram looks, sounds, and smells like you, but it is intangible. The hologram mimics your actions (including speech) unless you use a move action to direct it to act differently. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} and @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{Deafened}.If you desire, any spell you cast with a range of touch or greater can originate from the hologram instead of from you. The hologram can&rsquo;t cast spells on itself except for illusion spells. Spells cast in this manner affect other targets normally, despite originating from the hologram. An object isn&rsquo;t deceived by illusions (treat as if it had succeeded at its Will saving throw). The hologram remains for 1 round per level, and you must maintain line of effect to the hologram at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use&nbsp;dimension door,&nbsp;plane shift,&nbsp;teleport, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends. This casting of the spell is a shadow effect.</li>\n</ul>"
