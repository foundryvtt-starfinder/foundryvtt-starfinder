Each construct under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that construct.</p>\n<p>While this spell is in effect, the affected constructs follow any command you give them, even if it would be dangerous to the controlled constructs. At the end of the spell, the constructs revert to their normal behavior. If they are intelligent, they know and remember that you used magic to control them.</p>"
