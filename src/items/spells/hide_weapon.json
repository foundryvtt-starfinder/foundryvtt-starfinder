While the weapon is retracted, its shape adjusts to fit inside your arm, and you retain the use of your hand. Spotting the weapon on casual inspection is impossible, but anyone frisking you can attempt a Perception check to notice the weapon hidden inside your arm. The DC of this Perception check is equal to 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your key ability score modifier.</p>\n<p>If you cast this spell again while a casting is in effect, you can hide another weapon inside another arm, to a maximum of one weapon per arm you have. You can extend and retract all weapons hidden this way as part of the same action. If you’re disarmed of a melded weapon, this spell immediately ends for that weapon.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"
