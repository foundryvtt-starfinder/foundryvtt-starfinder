You must spend 5 Resolve Points when casting this spell to remove a permanent negative level. This spell can’t be used to remove more than 1 permanent negative level from a target in a 1-week period.</p>\n<p>Restoration heals all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target, but it doesn’t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or exhaustion from this spell can’t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.yd5mQwImyuqd8wUs]{Restoration, Lesser}</h2>\n<p>Lesser restoration dispels any magical effects reducing one of the target’s ability scores, or it heals 1d4 temporary ability damage to one of the target’s ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the creature or improves an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} condition to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.JGFn4MrDZ6X5vrzU]{Fatigued}, but it doesn’t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. It also doesn’t heal permanent ability drain. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or the reduction of exhaustion from lesser restoration can’t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.</p>"
