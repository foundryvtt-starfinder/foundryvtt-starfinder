      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell functions as&nbsp;lesser restoration, except it also removes temporary negative levels or 1 permanent negative level. You must spend 5 Resolve Points when casting this spell to remove a permanent negative level. This spell can&rsquo;t be used to remove more than 1 permanent negative level from a target in a 1-week period.<br /><br />Restoration&nbsp;heals all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target, but it doesn&rsquo;t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or exhaustion from this spell can&rsquo;t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Restoration, Lesser</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lesser restoration dispels any magical effects reducing one of the target&rsquo;s ability scores, or it heals 1d4 temporary ability damage to one of the target&rsquo;s ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the creature or improves an @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} condition to fatigued, but it doesn&rsquo;t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. It also doesn&rsquo;t heal permanent ability drain. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or the reduction of exhaustion from lesser restoration can&rsquo;t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.</p>",
