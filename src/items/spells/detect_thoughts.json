      "value": "<p>You detect the surface thoughts of intelligent creatures around you. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or target.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st Round:</strong> You detect the presence or absence of thoughts from conscious creatures that have Intelligence scores of at least 1 (or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;5) or higher.</li>\n<li><strong>2nd Round</strong>: You detect the number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score (or modifier) of each. If the highest Intelligence score is 26 (or a modifier of +8) or higher and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score (or 5 points higher than your own Intelligence modifier), you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell doesn&rsquo;t let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can&rsquo;t see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.</li>\n<li><strong>3rd Round</strong>: You can read the surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target who succeeds at its Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast <em>detect thoughts</em> again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 or an Intelligence modifier of &ndash;4 or lower) have simple, instinctual thoughts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>",
