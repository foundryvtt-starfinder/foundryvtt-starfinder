      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you need to keep track of comrades who get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general conditions. You are aware of the direction of and distance to the creatures and any conditions or states affecting them: confused, diseased, dying, nauseated, panicked, poisoned, staggered, stunned, unconscious, unharmed, wounded, wounded and out of Stamina points, and the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the targets, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a target leaves the plane (including via Drift travel) or dies, the spell ceases to function for that creature.</p>",
