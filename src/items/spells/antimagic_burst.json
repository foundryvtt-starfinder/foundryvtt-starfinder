This spell works like an area dispel from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.1FfFraWlxCu1L4rL]{Dispel Magic, Greater}, but your dispel check applies to every spell, supernatural effect, hybrid item, magic item, and magical effect in the area. For supernatural effects, the DC for your check equals 11 + the CR or level of the creature that created the effect. If the dispel check would end a summoning effect, it sends only those summoned creatures in the area back from whence they came. The antimagic suppresses an affected magic item’s magical capabilities for 1d4 rounds. Creatures and objects only partially within the area are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Creatures, including summoned ones that remain because the effect that summoned them isn’t dispelled, can attempt a Will saving throw against this effect, and their spell resistance applies. If a creature is affected, it can’t use its spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities for [[/r 1d4]] rounds. A magical construct that fails the save is also staggered for this time. Any creature affected by this spell can attempt a Will saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect on itself.</p>\n<p>This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.</p>"
