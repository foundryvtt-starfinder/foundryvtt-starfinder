This spell works like an area dispel from @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.1FfFraWlxCu1L4rL]{Dispel Magic, Greater}, but your dispel check applies to every spell, supernatural effect, hybrid item, magic item, and magical effect in the area. For supernatural effects, the DC for your check equals 11 + the CR or level of the creature that created the effect. If the dispel check would end a summoning effect, it sends only those summoned creatures in the area back from whence they came. The antimagic suppresses an affected magic item&rsquo;s magical capabilities for 1d4 rounds. Creatures and objects only partially within the area are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Creatures, including summoned ones that remain because the effect that summoned them isn&rsquo;t dispelled, can attempt a Will saving throw against this effect, and their spell resistance applies. If a creature is affected, it can&rsquo;t use its spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities for [[/r 1d4]] rounds. A magical construct that fails the save is also staggered for this time. Any creature affected by this spell can attempt a Will saving throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect on itself.</p>\n<p>This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.</p>"
