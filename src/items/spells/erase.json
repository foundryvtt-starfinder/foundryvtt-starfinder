      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from any written storage, including paper, computers, or similar devices. You remove up to 1,500 words worth of text (for computer files, this could be a 1,500-word data file or 1,500 words of computer code). With this spell, you can remove magic runes and glyphs created by spells of 3rd-level and lower.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nonmagical writing in a book or manual is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Magical writing and computer programs must be touched (either directly or by touching the physical drive that holds the file) to be erased, and you must also succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level for the magical writing or the item level of the computer&rsquo;s drive. Computers generally keep backups on a round-by-round basis, and when you erase code from a computer, it takes 1 round for the computer to access its backups. If you erase a file that stores continuous data (like a camera feed), the computer won&rsquo;t be able to recover the missing round. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase writing that is part of a trap (magical or otherwise), you set off that trap.</p>"
