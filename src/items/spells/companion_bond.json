Any creature that you have as a creature companion (Alien Archive 3 138) can instead be the target of this spell. You can communicate telepathically through the bond, regardless of language. No special power or influence is established because of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance provided you and the target are on the same plane. If the creature has an intelligence modifier of –3 or higher, they can communicate simple thoughts through the bond to you. Otherwise, the creature can communicate feelings through this bond but not words or complex concepts. If the target is your creature companion, it doesn’t need to see or hear you to receive your commands, and you receive a +2 morale bonus to Survival checks to control or ride the creature.</p>"
