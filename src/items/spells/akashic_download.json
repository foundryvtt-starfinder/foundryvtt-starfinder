Your tier 0 or better computer (such as a comm unit) instantly compiles snippets and selections from various media relevant to the subject. The information remains for 2 minutes, during which you explore it. Once you’re finished, you can attempt one skill check to recall knowledge on the topic with a +4 divine bonus, and you can do so untrained if the DC is 20 or lower. On a failed skill check, the GM can select some small insight into the topic that you retain. All the information you downloaded from this spell then disappears back to the Akashic Record. Using this spell doesn’t prevent you from doing further research using a downloaded data set or library chip, but perusing this magical download can’t be done concurrently with such study.</p>"
