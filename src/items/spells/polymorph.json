      "value": "<p>You change a willing target’s shape into a predetermined polymorphed form of your choice. When you select this spell as a spell known, you design four polymorphed forms for each spell level at which you can cast this spell. These forms should be premade, following the rules for spells with the polymorph descriptor (starting on page 141) and the restrictions for each spell level of this spell, and be as ready to use in play as all other aspects of a character are. Each time you gain a character level, you can change which forms you have available.</p>\n<p>You choose which of these predetermined polymorph forms the target changes into each time you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>1st:</strong> Casting polymorph as a 1st-level spell allows you to transform the target into one of the four 1st-level polymorphed forms you know.

Each form must be of the animal or humanoid type. You can target only creatures that are Small or Medium with this spell, and all your polymorphed forms must be Small or Medium. CR: The maximum CR is 1. Defenses: The form can grant DR 1/magic or resistance 2 to one energy type. Movement: The form can grant a land speed of up to 30 feet or a swim speed of up to 20 feet.
