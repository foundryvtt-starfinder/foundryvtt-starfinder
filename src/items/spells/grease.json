Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must succeed at a Reflex save or fall @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means the creature can’t move that round and must then succeed at a Reflex save or fall @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}, while failure by 5 or more means it falls @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} (see the Acrobatics skill on page 135 for details). A creature that doesn’t move on its turn doesn’t need to attempt this check and isn’t considered @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed}. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Unattended material objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect an object in a creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect. If the creature fails the initial saving throw, it immediately drops the item and must attempt a new save each round it attempts to pick up, hold, or use the item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to escape a grapple and a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against grapple combat maneuvers.</p>"
