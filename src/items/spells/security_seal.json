      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A&nbsp;security seal&nbsp;spell magically locks a single door, container with a lid or latch, portal, or computer system. Casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. You can freely bypass your own security seal without affecting it. If the sealed object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 5 while it remains attached to the object. If the object doesn’t have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a successful DC 20 Engineering check to disable devices. If the sealed object has computer security, the DC to bypass that security increases by 5. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;or&nbsp;knock&nbsp;spell. Add 5 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A&nbsp;knock&nbsp;spell removes the&nbsp;security seal&nbsp;automatically, counting as one means of closure.</p>",
