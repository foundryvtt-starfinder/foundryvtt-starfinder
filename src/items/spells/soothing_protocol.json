The target construct must have a CR lower than your level; if it does, the construct is convinced that you and your allies pose no threat. It can’t take violent actions against you or your allies, and it can’t do anything that would otherwise harm or threaten you (though it continues to carry out orders to take actions that do not harm or threaten you). Any aggressive action or damage dealt by you or your allies to a construct soothed in this way or its allies immediately ends this spell’s effects (and could cause the construct to attack you, if it was doing so previously).<br><br>If an affected construct is under the control of a spellcaster or another creature, the controlling creature can spend a full action to remove&nbsp;soothing protocol, as long as it can either touch the construct or give it an order.</p>"
