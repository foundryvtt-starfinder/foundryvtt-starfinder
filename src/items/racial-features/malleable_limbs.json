This adaptability grants a brakim a +4 species bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} checks to climb and to swim. If a brakim loses a limb or digit, it regrows in 1d4 hours. In addition, as a full action, a brakim can change up to all four of her limbs to give herself one of the following advantages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brakim can stretch her limbs. A stretched arm has 5 feet of additional reach. A stretched leg gives 5 feet of additional height. Stretched limbs are weak for combat, so a brakim takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls and gains no Strength bonus to damage with them. In addition, while her legs are stretched, a brakim can’t run or charge.</li>\n<li>A brakim can modify her arms for locomotion, moving as a quadruped and gaining a 10-foot enhancement bonus to her speed. While a brakim’s arms are modified this way, she can’t wield or hold objects that require two hands.</li>\n<li>A brakim can modify her legs and feet to be manipulators like arms and hands, respectively. In this mode, a brakim can wield or hold up to four hands worth of weapons or equipment. However, while a brakim holds an object with her modified foot, she takes a 10-foot penalty to her speed. While she holds an object that requires two hands with her feet and legs, she can move only by crawling. If a brakim wants to hold an object with every hand and foot, she must be @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}.</li>\n<li>As a move action, or a reaction when grabbed or otherwise held by a limb, a brakim can detach her limbs. She takes 1 damage directly to her Hit Points for each limb she sheds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Toggle on/off the selected effect in the Modifiers tab.
