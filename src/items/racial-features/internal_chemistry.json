A barathu with internal chemistry gains the following options instead of the typical options available for the early stage adaptation ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spraying acid is a simple chemistry exercise. The barathu gains an acid spray @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.RKy8zLwxSOk6kIwa]{Ranged Natural Weapons} that deals 1d3 acid damage with a 30-foot range increment. A PC using this ability is considered armed and gains a unique Weapon Specialization with this attack at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1-1/2 × their character level to their damage rolls with this attack. The acid spray cannot be disarmed or sundered and doesn't require ammunition.</li>\n<li>The barathu secretes a frictionless slime. When the barathu uses early stage adaptation to gain this ability, they can immediately attempt to use Acrobatics to escape a grapple without spending another action.</li>\n<li>Lighter-than-air gases increase the barathu’s fly speed by 15 feet.</li>\n<li>Soothing psychoactive chemicals grant the barathu a new saving throw against each ongoing mind-affecting effect that is affecting them.</li>\n<li>A cloud of fumes spreads over a 20-foot radius from the barathu, affecting the area as a smoke grenade. Barathus are immune to the choking effects of this cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This modifies early stage adaptation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong></strong><em>Toggle on/off the Fly speed bonus, when selecting this option, in the Modifiers tab.</em></p>"
