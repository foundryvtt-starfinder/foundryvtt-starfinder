      "value": "<p>Although most androids are manufactured to resemble @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans}, those crafted in the likenesses of other species exist. Such “xenometrics” possess abilities that mirror those of other races, sometimes even using hybrid tech to duplicate magic abilities.</p>\n<p>An android with this trait selects one of the species detailed in the paragraphs below. This choice cannot be changed. In addition to possessing physical features resembling those of the chosen species, the android’s size category and reach changes to match the chosen race. In addition, xenometric androids gain some of the chosen species’ racial traits, which are noted in parentheses next to the race’s name; these count as racial traits for the purposes of prerequisites. If a gained racial trait determines land speed, the android uses the speed as defined by that racial trait instead of that of the android. If the chosen species has a different type than humanoid, the xenometric android’s type changes to match.</p>\n<p>Starfinder Core Rulebook options are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf} (darkvision, slow but steady), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf} (elven immunities, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} (@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome} magic, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf} (adaptability, low-light vision), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc} (darkvision, intimidating, self-sufficient), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling} (keen senses, sneaky, sure-footed), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha} (four-armed, natural grace), lashunta (lashunta magic, limited telepathy), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} (blindsense, limited telepathy), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.7VtfabTXl7NEXC6u]{Vesk} (low-light vision, natural weapons), and ysoki (cheek pouches, darkvision).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive options are dragonkin (draconic immunities, flight), formian (limited telepathy, natural weapons), haan (firespray, slow fall), kalo (kalo movement, kalo vision), maraquoi (blindsense, prehensile tail), nuar (natural weapons, swift), verthani (skill focus, skin mimic), and wrikreechee (snag, wrikreechee movement).</p>\n<p>Starfinder Alien Archive 2 options are hobgoblin (fearsome, sneaky), @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.hVg8LYZczcXuweX4]{Orc} (fierce survivalist, orc ferocity), pahtra (nimble, talented), and vlaka (cold resistance, perceptive).</p>\n<p>The Starfinder Pact Worlds option is the strix (nightborn, strix mobility).</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces upgrade slot and exceptional vision.</strong></p>"
