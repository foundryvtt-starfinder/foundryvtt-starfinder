Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this racial trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three handsâ€™ worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces natural weapons.</strong></p>"
