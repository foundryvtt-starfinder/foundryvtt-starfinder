      "value": "<p>Some formians develop functional wings that are segmented and partly fold into grooves in the carapace between the shoulders when not in use. Known as alates, these winged individuals are often reproductive formians who travel widely to establish new colonies. After mating, these formians typically lose their wings and become queens, retiring from their adventures for the good of their burgeoning hive. For a variety of reasons, though, alates might retain their wings permanently. Although adept fliers, these formians’ carapaces are notably softer than average and lack most of the typical defensive protrusions. Formian alates have an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.KfEzPksDco3HYSjz]{natural weapons} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.HTLgCOOVnyP8Z05p]{sonic resistance}.</strong></p>"
