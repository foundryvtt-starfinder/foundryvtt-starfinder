A stellifera can dismiss this hydrobody as a standard action, and it disintegrates if he dies. The hydrobody affords the stellifera the size and reach of a Medium creature, and while unclad, it can fit through any opening the stellifera can without squeezing. While within a hydrobody, a stellifera has a Strength score 4 higher, 2 additional Hit Points, a land speed of 30 feet, a swim speed of 30 feet, and the ability to wield weapons and wear clothing and armor as a Medium creature. In addition, a stellifera in a hydrobody takes the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleed} effect from only a wound or severe wound critical hit effect, is immune to gases and inhaled @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons}, and gains a +4 species bonus to Fortitude saving throws against @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Diseases} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} of the contact or injury types. The hydrobody slowly exchanges oxygen with the surrounding atmosphere or liquid, including environmental protections from armor, allowing the stellifera to breathe as if he were underwater. The nature of this body makes the stellifera immune to most effects of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.BWuAh3NeW0Dcnjon]{vacuum} as well as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.NOrSFYXShdxot60k]{atmospheric} or underwater pressure. The hydrobody stores enough oxygen at one time for a stellifera to go 1 hour without oxygen exchange from his surroundings. After that time, he risks @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{suffocation}.</p>\n<p><em>Active feature to maintain Hydrobody and all it's benefits.</em></p>"
