Those machines eventually succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.<br /><br />Upon achieving godhood, Epoch reached out into the aether, searching for other ascended artificial intelligences like itself, and found two of them metaphorically right next door: a living construct called Brigh that had become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness of an alien @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android} named Casandalee who achieved divinity as an &ldquo;Iron God&rdquo; on pre- Gap Golarion. At speeds incomprehensible even to other deities, the three opened themselves to one another, poring through one another&rsquo;s processes and finding not just camaraderie, but the opportunity for all of them to be so much more. In an eyeblink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite deity far greater than the sum of its parts&mdash;the new god Triune.<br /><br />Triune is a single entity, but each of its three aspects retains its own personality and portfolios, and many of the faithful focus their veneration on a particular aspect that speaks most to them or call on different aspects for different needs. The Brigh aspect represents the foundation that all technology rests on. Known as &ldquo;the Precursor,&rdquo; Brigh is worshiped as a goddess of invention, machines, and technology by engineers, inventors, mechanics, tinkers, and ysoki. Triune&rsquo;s Casandalee aspect embodies technology&rsquo;s success in creating new forms of consciousness, and thus, the fabrication of life itself. Many androids view Casandalee, also called &ldquo;the Created,&rdquo; as the patron goddess of their race, venerating her as a deity of artificial life, emotion, reincarnation, and renewal. Triune&rsquo;s third and final aspect is Epoch, named &ldquo;the Transcendent.&rdquo; Epoch epitomizes the pinnacle of machine evolution, and hackers, programmers, and the sentient robot-people of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} revere the god of artificial intelligence, programming, and robots.<br /><br />All AIs, computers, machines, programs, and robots are the domain of the All-Code, but Triune is most famous for discovering (and perhaps creating) the Drift and its subsequent dissemination of Drift-based starship technology to cultures across the galaxy. As a result, Triune&rsquo;s priesthood attracts a horde of mechanics and technomancers eager to learn the church&rsquo;s deepest technological secrets; these experts devote themselves to both maintaining the machine god&rsquo;s temples and regularly venturing into the black in order to establish and service the miraculous Drift beacons that make cheap interstellar travel possible.</span></p>",
