        "value": "<p>This trap consists of several 5-foot-square trapdoors that open when a creature stands on one, dumping the victim down a 60-foot-long chute and into a 30-foot-by-30-foot trash compactor with a single locked exit in one corner. The room is filled with debris and the floor functions as difficult terrain. One round later on the trap&rsquo;s initiative count, two of the walls of the room begin closing inward, reducing the width of the room by 10 feet each round (to 20 feet on the first round, and so on). On the first round, this deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to all nonamorphous creatures in the room. The damage increases to 8d6 on the second round, and to 32d6 on the third round. On the fourth round, the trash compactor&rsquo;s exit opens to release the compressed garbage. A creature can climb back up the slippery chute with a successful DC 32 Athletics check. The gears controlling the compression mechanism have EAC 14, KAC 20, hardness 20, and 69 Hit Points.</p>"
