Portable altars can be made of durable plastic, ceramic, or even wood, and they are usually ornately decorated and embellished with the religious iconography of a particular deity or faith. One side of the altar is a hinged lid, allowing you to store items such as holy texts, religious symbols, and other religious accoutrements inside.</p>"
