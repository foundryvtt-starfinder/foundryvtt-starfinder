      "value": "<p>A quyu’s eyes in its facade form are the most unique part of its hunting tactics, exhibiting hypnotic capabilities that emotionally hijack the brain. Before revealing itself, a quyu tries to enchant its prey to reduce the likelihood that they will be able to fight back. When the quyu shifts, these eyes appear to rip open, but the organ can still be found inside the true form’s head. Even when the quyu is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, these organs maintain their magical emotional affects and can cause fascination. When implanted into a sighted being’s head, they are able to transfer visual information to the brain, but primarily maintain their function as hypnotic organs.</p>\n<p>A quyu’s “eyes” maintain their captivating effects after the creature’s death, and can be implanted to replace any of your current eyes. As a quyu’s eyes are not visual organs, you must retain at least one of your original eyes to maintain your normal vision; otherwise you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} condition for as long as you have this augmentation installed. An implanted quyu eye is visibly unique from any of your other eyes.</p>\n<p>When you attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check against a target for the first time each day, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the attempt. Alternatively, once per day, you can take a standard action to activate the eye’s mesmerizing qualities and attempt to fascinate one target. The target must succeed a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.7PPRS6krnvaTHbxh]{Fascinated}; regardless of whether the target succeeds, it is immune to the effects of all quyu eyes for 24 hours.</p>"
