The most common of these is a stalkring, a band of stone or metal sized to be worn around a quorlu’s eyestalk. Creatures lacking such extremities can wear similar rings on a similarly slender appendage. Most stalkrings are decorative in nature, though the ever-pragmatic quorlus have also imbued some stalkrings with beneficial qualities.</p>\n<p>An<em>obsidian stalkring</em>is wrought from volcanic glass, resulting in a complex intertwined design that faintly shimmers as though surrounded by an aura of extreme heat. While wearing an obsidian stalkring, you can communicate with creatures with the fire subtype as though you had telepathy with a range of 60 feet. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Charisma-based checks and Sense Motive checks against such creatures. In addition, an obsidian stalkring allows you to spend 1 Resolve Point to cast charm monster on a creature with the fire subtype (Will DC 18 negates). Once you have done so, you cannot use another obsidian stalkring to do so for 24 hours, and the obsidian stalkring you used to do so can’t allow the spell to be cast from it again for 24 hours.</p>"
