When used as ammunition for weapons other than the 1st-level bow (such as crossbolters), these arrows don’t increase damage, but diamond-edge arrows gain the wound critical hit effect and molecular rift arrows gain the severe wound critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the effect granted by the arrow.</p>"
