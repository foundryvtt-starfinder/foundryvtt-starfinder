      "value": "<p>This rubbery, organic cord is 5 feet long and has a plug on each end that attaches to a computer, allowing you to interface with the computer from a distance. You can use a standard action to control the cord using a computer attached to one of these ends. The cord can stretch, contract, and bend around obstacles, moving up to 20 feet each time you direct it. Its maximum length is 50 feet. It can also grab onto and move a computer of light or negligible Bulk by plugging into it and pulling, but it disconnects if used to pull an object of more than light bulk. Moving a crawling cord past observers without being noticed requires a successful Sleight of Hand check, opposed by the Perception check of any observer. The cable draws power from any computers to which it is attached.</p>\n<p>Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>"
