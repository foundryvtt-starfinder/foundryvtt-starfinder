You can double the occupancy of a tent by doubling its price, triple it by tripling its price, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tents known as mobile hoteliers are advanced and include systems that provide their occupants the same @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} as armor (see page 196) while active. A mobile hotelier requires a 20-charge battery to provide this protection, uses 1 charge every 8 hours, and is considered a technological item for effects and abilities that target or disable technology. Even if this protection is removed, the tent can still be used as a mass-produced tent.</strong></p>"
