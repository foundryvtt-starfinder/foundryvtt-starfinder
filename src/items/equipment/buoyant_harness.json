      "value": "<p>This silky, palm-sized pouch is worn on the back and includes stretchy bands that can slip over all major limbs. Visitors to @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.2K7muQyxlXW8wqb3]{Bretheda} don buoyant harnesses while within the upper levels of the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, but some planetary explorers also find them useful for arresting sudden falls. Putting on a buoyant harness is a full action. You can deploy a properly attached buoyant harness as a reaction by pulling sharply on any of the bands. Once deployed, the pouch uses organically heated helium to inflate into a balloon as large as you and filling the space directly above you, causing you to float; while floating, use the rules for moving in zero gravity. A buoyant harness does not function in heavy or extreme gravity. The balloon remains inflated and self-heated as long as it has charges remaining. You can deflate it as a move action, collapsing it by the start of your next turn. If you deflate a buoyancy harness while it is maintaining your altitude, you immediately descend 60 feet; if you reach the ground, you land safely. If not, you fall any remaining distance.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>"
