A scope can&rsquo;t be added to a weapon with a sight. As a move action, you can aim through a scope. This can be done as part of the same move action required to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special quality, or as part of a @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{Trick Attack (Ex)} where you do not take any movement even if you also aim a sniper weapon as part of that action. Aiming through a scope reduces penalties to attack rolls due to range as well as bonuses to AC from cover.<br /><br />In addition, a scope increases a weapon&rsquo;s range increment for determining penalties to attack rolls due to range. For small arms, a scope increases the weapon&rsquo;s normal range increment to 1-1/2 times its listed range for this purpose. For longarms and heavy weapons, the increase is 4 times the normal range increment. For sniper weapons, the increase is twice the range increment of the sniper special property. The reduction in penalties due to aiming with a scope applies only to the next </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\">attack roll you make with the weapon before the end of your next turn. Scopes also confer other benefits depending on their type.<br /><br />You can also view distant objects through a scope as a move action, which grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to vision-based Perception checks against objects 30 feet or farther from you. You can use a scope for this purpose when it is not attached to or integrated with a weapon. A detached scope does not provide improved accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\">A clarity scope functions as a <em>revealing scope</em>, with additional capabilities while the scope&rsquo;s magical sensors are active. Activating or deactivating a <em>clarity scope</em> is a move action. When aiming or looking through a <em>clarity scope</em> with active sensors, you can see through illusions, and you eliminate your miss chance due to concealment other than total concealment. In addition, you gain sense through (vision) that allows you to sense through only the first creature or object between you and your target, provided that the creature or object is within the weapon&rsquo;s first scope-enhanced range increment (including the enhanced range increment from the sniper special property).</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>",
