      "value": "<p>Renowned for its iridescence, the gemstone lusinite has a dazzling quality that often sees the mineral hoarded by birds and other animals as treasures. As anaeon stone, it captivate creatures in three ways. As part of the action used to cast a spell with the charm descriptor, you can activate thisaeon stoneto negate any bonus to the saving throw one target might receive for being threatened or attacked by you or your allies. Second, you can activate theaeon stoneas a reaction when you attempt a Charisma check to convince a charmed creature to follow your suggestions. Third, you can activate theaeon stoneas a reaction when a threatening behavior by you or your allies would end the effects of your spell with the charm descriptor. The charmed creature attempts a Will save against the spell with a +5 enhancement bonus; if it succeeds, it ends the spell as normal, but if it fails, that threatening action does not break the spell (though subsequent actions might do so).</p>\n<p>You can activate thelusinite rosetwice per day, using any combination of these three effects. A creature is immune to theaeon stone’s effects if it cannot see the item.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Aeon stones</h2>\n<p><em>Aeon stones</em>&nbsp;are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements.&nbsp;<em>Aeon stones</em>&nbsp;are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.</p>\n<p>Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em>&nbsp;must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em>&nbsp;has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).</p>\n<p>Most&nbsp;<em>aeon stones</em>&nbsp;(including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em> also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you.</p>"
