Once per day, when a numbing weapon deals cold damage to an enemy, you can activate the fusion as a reaction to make a disarm attempt against that target with the same attack bonus as the weapon attack. The target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the weapon’s item level + the ability score modifier you apply to attack rolls with the weapon) or feel a lack of sensation in its limbs, taking a –4 penalty to attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saving throws for 1 round. The numbing weapon can be applied only to weapons that deal cold damage.</p>"
