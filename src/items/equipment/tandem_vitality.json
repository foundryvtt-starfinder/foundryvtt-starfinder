      "value": "<p>This armor upgrade is purchased as a set of two, each of which is installed in a different suit of armor. A creature wearing armor equipped with tandem vitality can touch another creature also wearing armor with the same upgrade and take a standard action to attune the two creatures to each other. A tandem vitality upgrade can be attuned to only one other tandem vitality upgrade at a time. Once attuned, the two creatures become quantum entangled and can exchange their life force over vast distances. Once per day, a creature wearing armor with this upgrade can take a standard action to activate it, choose to take any amount of damage that doesn&rsquo;t reduce the creature to 0 Hit Points, and then become staggered for 1 round. The creature to which they are attuned gains temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage taken.</p>\n<p>In addition to the regular rules for armor upgrades, tandem upgrades function only if another ally possesses the same upgrade and both allies currently have the same tandem upgrade installed.</p>"
