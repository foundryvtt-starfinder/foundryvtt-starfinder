Additionally, the ring’s magic refreshes your body and mind while worn, so you need only 2 hours of sleep each day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of rest. If you cast spells, you can regain your daily spell slots after only 2 hours of rest, but you still can’t do so more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before its magic takes effect, and if removed you must wear it for another week to reattune it to you.</p>"
