      "value": "<p>Explosive ammo is used with projectile weapons and is available for most projectile weapons and other weapons that fire arrows and darts, as noted on Table 1–8. A weapon firing explosive ammo deals its normal amount of damage, but half of this damage is fire damage and grants the weapon the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown} critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown} critical hit effect is added and considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect. If the weapon normally already has the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown} critical hit effect, it instead gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Push} (5 feet) critical hit effect in addition to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Knockdown}, and this considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 25</p>"
