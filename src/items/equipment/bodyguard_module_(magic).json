      "value": "<p>This shield-shaped armor plate pulses with magical energy when another upgrade of the same type is nearby. When an ally within 30 feet who is also wearing a bodyguard module takes damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to cause the target to take only half the damage, and you take the amount of damage not taken by the target. The damage you take canâ€™t be negated, reduced, or redirected in any way. Forms of harm that do not involve Hit Points or Stamina Points, such as ability drain, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Charm effects}, death effects, permanent negative levels, and temporary ability damage, are not affected.<br>This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>",
