      "value": "<h2>TASHTARI BIOTECH</h2>\n<p>Hunters can do brisk business harvesting the filaments, photoenergetic nodes, and focusing membranes of tashtaris and selling them to bioengineers. If not for conservation efforts on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, tashtaris could have been hunted to extinction, since their photosensitive adaptations are difficult and expensive to duplicate through synthetic means. Cessation of hostilities between the formians and lashuntas has allowed a recent surge in the regulated trade of biotech that incorporates tashtari tissue. Explorers and scouts equip themselves with focusing membranes or filament mesh, and many people throughout the Pact Worlds use photoenergetic nodes for practical and cosmetic purposes.</p>\n<h2>Filament Mesh</h2>\n<p>A network of tashtari filaments implanted under the topmost layers of your skin allows you to harness and release energy from solar radiation. As a standard action, provided you have spent 4 hours of the past 24-hour period in bright light or direct sunlight, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cause your filaments to glow with intense light.</p>\n<p>Any creature (other than you) that can see this light and is within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>Mk 2 filament mesh causes all creatures that fail the Fortitude save to instead be @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} for 1d4 rounds. When exposed to bright light, filament mesh is faintly visible as a reflective tracery under your skin. This augmentation can&rsquo;t absorb or release light if your skin is completely covered with protective gear that doesn&rsquo;t allow light through. You must have armor adjusted to accommodate this augmentation (CRB pg. 196). Normal clothing allows enough solar radiation through to charge the augmentation.</p>"
