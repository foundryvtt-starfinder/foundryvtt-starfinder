      "value": "<p>Seeker slime is an iridescent ooze programmed to detect and bond to minuscule gaps in a structure. Originally used by engineers and shipwrights to check for cracks invisible to the naked eye, many adventurers and criminals keep a wad of seeker slime in their pocket. As a standard action, a creature can remove a seeker slime from its packaging and affix it to a surface such as a door or wall. The seeker slime begins moving over the surface at a rate of 1 foot per round; if there is a concealed door, technological trap, or hidden opening in a structure, the slime settles into it, allowing nearby creatures a +5 circumstance bonus to Perception checks made to locate the feature. Once the seeker slime settles or after 5 minutes, whichever comes first, the slime bonds to the surface and can be removed with a successful DC 10 Strength check. After this time, the slime congeals into an inert, useless putty.</p>"
