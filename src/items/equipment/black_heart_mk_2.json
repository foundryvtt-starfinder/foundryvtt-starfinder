A black heart is a strip of necromancy-infused undead flesh that turns whatever organ it is attached to a deep shade of ebony.</p>\n<p>You gain the benefits of the environmental protections of armor (Core Rulebook 196), which last for a number of days equal to double the necrograft’s item level. A black heart automatically recharges 1 hour of this duration for each hour this ability is not in use (up to its normal maximum). Additionally, you gain an enhancement bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning effects equal to the necrograft’s mark, unless the effect specifies it functions against undead.</p>"
