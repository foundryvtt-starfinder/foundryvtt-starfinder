A series of hexagonal quartz crystals inscribed with runes are placed at regular intervals over the armor, catching light and making it refract at odd angles due to birefringence. A quartz refractor grants resistance 10 against damage dealt by laser weapons (this doesnâ€™t stack with any other resistance that would reduce similar damage, such as fire resistance).</p>"
