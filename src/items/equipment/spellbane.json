A target affected by the spellbane critical hit effect must succeed at a Will save (DC as normal for a weapon of the given item level; see page 181 of the <em>SFRPG Core Rulebook</em>) or be unable to cast spells or use spell-like abilities for 1d4 rounds. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you can choose to apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the spellbane effect when you score a critical hit.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">If a <em>spellbane</em> weapon also has a fusion that allows it to bypass damage reduction of a specific alignment (such as an <em>unholy</em> weapon&rsquo;s ability to bypass DR/evil), its spellbane critical hit effect works only against creatures with the diametrically opposed alignment (for example, good creatures in the case of a <em>spellbane unholy</em> weapon), but the save DC of the spellbane critical hit effect increases by 2.</span></p>",
