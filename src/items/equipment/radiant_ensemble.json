It appears to be crafted from shimmering crystal, and functions as a set of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.ozUIux1kwjBz9fwz]{formal clothing}. A radiant ensemble seems to simultaneously shine (increasing the light level by one step in a 10-foot radius) and cause light to bend around it (granting a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells and effects that cause the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} condition). Three times per day, you can cause the radiant ensemble to give off a brilliant flash of light as a standard action. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you is blinded for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier), in which case they are merely dazzled for 1 round.</p>"
