If you were neither @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} nor fatigued, you instead gain a +3 morale bonus to Strength-, Dexterity- and Constitution-based ability checks and skill checks, and you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your speed for all of your modes of movement until the end of your next turn.</p>"
