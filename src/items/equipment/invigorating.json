After making a successful attack with this weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you feel a rush of energy that eliminates the fatigued condition and reduces exhaustion to fatigue. If you were neither @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} nor fatigued, you instead gain a +3 morale bonus to Strength-, Dexterity- and Constitution-based ability checks and skill checks, and you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your speed for all of your modes of movement until the end of your next turn.</span></p>",
