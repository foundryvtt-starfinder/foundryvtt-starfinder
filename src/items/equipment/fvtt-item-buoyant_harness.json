      "value": "<p>This silky, palm-sized pouch is worn on the back and includes stretchy bands that can slip over all major limbs. Visitors to Bretheda don buoyant harnesses while within the upper levels of the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, but some planetary explorers also find them useful for arresting sudden falls. Putting on a buoyant harness is a full action. You can deploy a properly attached buoyant harness as a reaction by pulling sharply on any of the bands. Once deployed, the pouch uses organically heated helium to inflate into a balloon as large as you and filling the space directly above you, causing you to float; while floating, use the rules for moving in zero gravity. A buoyant harness does not function in heavy or extreme gravity. The balloon remains inflated and self-heated as long as it has charges remaining. You can deflate it as a move action, collapsing it by the start of your next turn. If you deflate a buoyancy harness while it is maintaining your altitude, you immediately descend 60 feet; if you reach the ground, you land safely. If not, you fall any remaining distance.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>",
