You can activate or deactivate light sleep as a move action. When you do, you become absolutely still, have a minimal heat signature, and exhibit no vital signs or need to eat, sleep, or breathe. This grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. You can’t take any action other than to deactivate light sleep. You’re dimly aware of your surroundings, but you take a –10 penalty to Perception checks. You can remain in light sleep for up to 7 consecutive days; once you emerge from light sleep, this augmentation requires 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute to enter deep sleep. You gain all the benefits of light sleep, but the penalty to Perception checks increases to –20. You can’t take actions in deep sleep, but you can deactivate deep sleep and wake up, which requires 1 hour. You can remain in deep sleep for up to 1 year for every point of Constitution you have; once you emerge from deep sleep, this augmentation requires 1 week to recharge before it can be used again.</p>"
