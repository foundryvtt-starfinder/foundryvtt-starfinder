You can add your Dexterity modifier to this attack roll rather than your Strength modifier. If you hit, your target gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition for 1d4 rounds. Ending the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition requires the target to succeed at an Acrobatics check or Strength check as a move action (DC = 10 + half your level + your Dexterity modifier). Once you have used your restraining spinneret, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>"
