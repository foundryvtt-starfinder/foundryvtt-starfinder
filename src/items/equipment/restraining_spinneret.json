      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListBiotech_ctl00_LabelName\">Your hand conceals a rapid-acting spinneret you can use to entangle an opponent with sticky webbing if you succeed at a melee attack against their EAC. You can add your Dexterity modifier to this attack roll rather than your Strength modifier. If you hit, your target gains the entangled condition for 1d4 rounds. Ending the entangled condition requires the target to succeed at an Acrobatics check or Strength check as a move action (DC = 10 + half your level + your Dexterity modifier). Once you have used your restraining spinneret, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</span></p>",
