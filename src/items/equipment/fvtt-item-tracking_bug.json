      "value": "<p>This tiny tracking device contains a miniaturized transponder that makes it easier to follow and locate quarry. Tracking bugs are usually sold on Absalom Station to private detective agencies and suspicious family members. You can hide a tracking bug on a creature as a standard action with a successful Sleight of Hand check to pick the creature&rsquo;s pocket (this usually can&rsquo;t be done during combat). You can hide a tracking bug on a vehicle or other conveyance as a standard action with a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the Perception checks of anyone searching the vehicle; you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this check due to the tracking bug&rsquo;s size.<br /><br />Once you plant a tracking bug, you can use a custom program (included in the tracking bug&rsquo;s price) to follow the tracking bug with a successful DC 20 Computers check using a computer, a comm unit, a mechanic&rsquo;s custom rig, or any similar computing device; the GM can alter this DC to reflect environmental conditions and other factors. The tracking bug&rsquo;s transponder has a 500-foot-radius range, and you must be on the same plane as the tracking bug for the program to function. When a tracking bug runs out of power, you can no longer follow it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/hour</p>",
