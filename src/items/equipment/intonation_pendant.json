To use one, it must first be placed on the throat (or similar part of the body close to the voice box) of a helpless, unconscious, or willing living creature or a creature that has been @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} for no longer than 1 hour. As the&nbsp;intonation pendant&nbsp;attunes to that creature over the next 10 minutes, it begins to glow faintly. An&nbsp;intonation pendant&nbsp;can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and if attuned to a second creature, it loses all information provided by the first creature.</p>\n<p>Once the pendant is attuned, it provides the wearer with the exact tone and speech mannerisms of the target creature. This provides the wearer with a +4 enhancement bonus to Bluff checks to convince others that they are the target creature. In addition, once per day, the wearer can roll a Disguise check twice and take the better result when attempting to appear as the target creature, as long as the wearer is speaking to those they are trying to fool.</p>"
