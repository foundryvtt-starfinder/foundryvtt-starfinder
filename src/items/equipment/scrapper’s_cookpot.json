Once per day, you can fill this sturdy ceramic crock with inorganic material weighing 1 bulk, such as scrap metal, rocks, and plastic. After filling the rest of the pot with water and simmering the contents over a heat source for 1 hour, the pot converts its contents into thick, nutrient-rich porridge sufficient to feed up to six Medium creatures for a day. The raw materials used have some influence over the porridge&rsquo;s flavor profile, though the result is always at least mildly unpalatable in one way or another.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Regularly consuming </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">scrapper&rsquo;s cookpot </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">meals sometimes has unfortunate side effects, such as contracting variants of blinding sickness or the shakes after weeks of use (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Core Rulebook </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">418&ndash;419).
