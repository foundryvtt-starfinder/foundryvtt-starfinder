A scope can&rsquo;t be added to a weapon with a sight. As a move action, you can aim through a scope. This can be done as part of the same move action required to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special quality, or as part of a @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{Trick Attack (Ex)} where you do not take any movement even if you also aim a sniper weapon as part of that action. Aiming through a scope reduces penalties to attack rolls due to range as well as bonuses to AC from cover.<br /><br />In addition, a scope increases a weapon&rsquo;s range increment for determining penalties to attack rolls due to range. For small arms, a scope increases the weapon&rsquo;s normal range increment to 1-1/2 times its listed range for this purpose. For longarms and heavy weapons, the increase is 4 times the normal range increment. For sniper weapons, the increase is twice the range increment of the sniper special property. The reduction in penalties due to aiming with a scope applies only to the next </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\">attack roll you make with the weapon before the end of your next turn. Scopes also confer other benefits depending on their type.<br /><br />You can also view distant objects through a scope as a move action, which grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to vision-based Perception checks against objects 30 feet or farther from you. You can use a scope for this purpose when it is not attached to or integrated with a weapon. A detached scope does not provide improved accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span>A <em>revealing scope</em> functions as a combined laser scope and nightvision scope with the addition of enhanced magical sensors. Three times per day as a move action, you can activate a <em>revealing scope&rsquo;s</em> sensors for 10 minutes. When aiming or looking through a <em>revealing scope</em> with active sensors, you can see invisible and ethereal creatures, and you reduce your miss chance due to concealment other than total concealment by 10%. Deactivating a <em>revealing scope&rsquo;s</em> sensors is a move action.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>"
