This image is uploaded to a designated comm unit as well as to a set of glasses included with the sphere (both of which must be within 30 feet of the sphere to receive the signal). While wearing the glasses, a creature gains telemetric insights that grant a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and reduce the wearer&rsquo;s miss chance due to concealment by 5% for any creatures or features in the area. The telemetry&rsquo;s relevance fades quickly, and these benefits cease at the end of your next turn. A snapshot sphere is carefully weighted to not roll far on a level surface, and it doubles its hardness when resisting falling damage.</span></p>"
