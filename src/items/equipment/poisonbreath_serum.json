This grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i]{Intimidate} checks against adjacent living creatures that can smell your breath. During the serum’s duration, you can take a standard action to breath a cloud of poisonous mist in a 15-foot cone. Each living creature in the area is affected by @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.EmB9F8YP23oXVtyO]{Insanity Mist} (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 419). Once you’ve breathed out the poison, the serum’s other effect immediately ends.</p><h2>Serums</h2><p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
