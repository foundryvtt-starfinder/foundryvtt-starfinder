      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">This fusion infuses the disruption of kishalee weapons into the weapon&rsquo;s output. Half of the weapon&rsquo;s damage type is replaced with sonic damage, and it gains the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Staggered} critical hit effect. You can activate or deactivate the dimensional disruption fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the dimensional disruption fusion). If the weapon already has a critical effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Staggered} effect, though you can apply the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Staggered} effect only if the target takes sonic damage from this fusion. This fusion can never cause a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.</span></p>",
