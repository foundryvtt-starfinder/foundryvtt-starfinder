A hybrid <em>flash suppressor</em> can be added to any small arm, longarm, heavy weapon, or sniper weapon in the projectile category. It eliminates virtually all light and heat that your projectile weapon produces while firing, making you harder to spot in low-light conditions. This benefit reduces the penalty you take to Stealth checks for sniping in low-light conditions by 5.<br /><br />You can combine a <em>flash suppressor</em> and <em>silencer</em> together by paying the combined price of both accessories. Their benefits stack.&nbsp;</span></p>",
