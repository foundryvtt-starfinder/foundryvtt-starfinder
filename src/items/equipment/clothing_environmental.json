Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Each environmental outfit is designed with a specific climate in mind, and wearing such an outfit in an extreme environmental condition it is tailored for grants a benefit as follows: cold climates (+2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers), dust storms (reduce damage from dust storms with windstorm-magnitude winds by 1), extreme gravity (reduce damage from extreme gravity environments by 1), heat climates (+2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental heat dangers), radiation (+1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against radiation effects), and zero gravity (+2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics or Athletics checks to stop movement or climb along handholds in zero-g). See Chapter 11 for more information on environmental dangers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The benefit of an environmental outfit can be added to another type of clothing (including a different environmental outfit) by doubling and adding together the price of both types of clothing.</strong></p>"
