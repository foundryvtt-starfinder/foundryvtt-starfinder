By presenting the disk to a creature within 10 feet and pressing the button (all a standard action), you can erase the last 5 minutes of that creature&rsquo;s memory as per&nbsp;modify memory&nbsp;by introducing a series of flashing lights into its visual sensors that directly affects the brain. The creature can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to negate this effect. A creature currently being threatened by you or your allies receives a +4 circumstance bonus to the save. A creature that succeeds at the save is instead @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} for 1d4+4 rounds. This is a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Mind-affecting} @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent} effect.<br /><br />A memory expunger uses a standard battery, and each use expends 5 charges.</p>",
