In addition, once per day as a full action, you can move up to your speed through other creatures&rsquo; spaces (as long as those creatures aren&rsquo;t larger than you are). Each creature in your path automatically takes 2d6+4 bludgeoning damage. A target of this trample ability can make an attack of opportunity against you as you pass through its space, but at a &minus;4 penalty. A target can forgo this attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to take half damage.</p>"
