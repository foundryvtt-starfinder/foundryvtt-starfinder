In addition, once per day as a full action, you can move up to your speed through other creatures’ spaces (as long as those creatures aren’t larger than you are). Each creature in your path automatically takes 2d6+4 bludgeoning damage. A target of this trample ability can make an attack of opportunity against you as you pass through its space, but at a −4 penalty. A target can forgo this attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to take half damage.</p>"
