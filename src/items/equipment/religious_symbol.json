Each deity and religion has its own unique religious symbol. Religious symbols are usually mass-produced from cheap materials, such as plastic or thin metal, but they can be crafted out of other materials as well, with prices dependent on the material used. This item can also be used to represent badges or symbols of nonreligious organizations and groups.&nbsp;</span></p>",
