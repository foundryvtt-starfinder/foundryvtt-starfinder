      "value": "<p>Biotechnicians speculate that a rendalairn has an internal structure that stabilizes it and enables it to create its quake pulse. Bleeding-edge tech has been invented based on these theories, allowing augmentation of the central nervous system.</p>\n<p>A seismic spine gives you resistance 15 to electricity damage and sonic damage. Once per day as a standard action, you can stomp the ground or otherwise create percussion, such as by clapping your hands, to unleash a shockwave from your seismic spine. Creatures and objects within a 20-foot-radius spread of you take 10d6 electricity and sonic damage (Fortitude save for half damage; DC = 10 + half your character level + your Constitution modifier). A creature that fails the saving throw is knocked @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. If a technological construct fails the save, the construct is also @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned} for 1 round even if it is normally immune to being @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{Stunned}. Unattended hybrid or technological objects in the area cease functioning for 1 round. Once you have used your seismic spine, you can do so again only after you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, and you must spend 1 Resolve Point to use your seismic spine each time after the first time per day.</p>",
