As a move action, you can squirt blood from your eye at a foe within 30 feet. Make a ranged attack against the targetâ€™s KAC. A successful hit grants the next ally who attacks that foe the benefit of harrying fire. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 character levels you have.</p>"
