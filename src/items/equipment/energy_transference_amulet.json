Upon discovering that non-witchwyrds can benefit from the devices just as readily, witchwyrds now sell the amulets across the galaxy. While you wear this inverted triangle amulet, as a reaction, you can catchmagic missilesfired at you, catching up to one missile per free hand (or grasping appendage). You must be aware of the incomingmagic missilesand can’t be flat-footed while using this ability. After catching a missile, that hand manifests a faintly glowing nimbus for 6 rounds, during which time the hand can’t catch additional missiles. As a move action, you can transfer the captured energy from one or more hands to a battery within your reach, restoring 1d4 of the battery’s expended charges per missile’s energy you transfer in this way. A hand that transfers its energy to a battery no longer glows and is available to catch additionalmagic missiles.</p>\n<p>This amulet functions as an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.6TCH9JJ2xwLS7DkC]{Absorp Force Graft} (Alien Archive 4140), and you can use the capturedmagic missileenergy to instead activate any @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.9fBQJY9B3gUNRJAm]{Force Bolt Graft} (Alien Archive 4144) you have.</p>"
