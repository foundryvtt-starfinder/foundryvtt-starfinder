      "value": "<p>Some techniques from silicon mummification have been adapted to aid the living. The mummies&rsquo; same specialized silicon exterior can be applied to most armor as an upgrade.</p>\n<p>A thick silicon coating infused with magitech photocells coats your armor. A silicon armor casing can store up to 10 charges, but it can&rsquo;t be charged via conventional recharging methods; instead, for every 8 hours spent in an area of normal or bright light illuminated by a star, the silicon armor casing gains 1 charge. As a move action, you can expend 1 charge either to recharge 1 day of the armor&rsquo;s environmental protections, or to restore 1 charge to one of the armor&rsquo;s other armor upgrades. As a swift action, you can expend 2 of the armor casing&rsquo;s charges to empower a melee or ranged attack, causing that attack to deal 2d6 additional fire damage if it hits (or 1d6 fire damage if the attack affects multiple creatures). As a swift action, you can expend 4 charges to increase the DC of one spell you cast before the end of your turn by 1.</p>",
