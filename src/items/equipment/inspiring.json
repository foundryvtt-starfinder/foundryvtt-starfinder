When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the <em>inspiring</em> fusion, you and all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against attacks, effects, and spells from the target of your attack for 1 minute. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the <em>inspiring</em> effect.&nbsp;</span></p>",
