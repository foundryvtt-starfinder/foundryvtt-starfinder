Some specialized scanners can also provide other senses, such as blindsense or sense through, but these often require ongoing monitoring or impose other restrictions. Common examples include laser microphones, motion detectors, and x-ray visors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An enhanced camera functions as a video camera, but it can view a wider band of wavelengths, including infrared wavelengths. Enhanced cameras have low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
