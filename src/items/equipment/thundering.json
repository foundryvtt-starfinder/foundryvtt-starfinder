Half the weapon&rsquo;s damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the <em>thundering </em>fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the <em>thundering </em>fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.</span></p>",
