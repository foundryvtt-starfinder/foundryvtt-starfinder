      "value": "<p>This Small drone is designed to provide basic assistance aboard a starship or other large vessel, including supplemental computation for navigation or astrogation. Most deckhand drones resemble a squat box with stubby, clawed feet that allow it to keep its orientation in zero-g. A deckhand drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and tool arm (fire extinguisher) mods instead of the stealth droneâ€™s normal initial mods. If an activated deckhand drone is accessible to a creature attempting a Piloting check to navigate, that creature reduces the time needed to plot a course by half (generally from 10 minutes to 5 minutes). Its skill unit is Computers. A deckhand drone has 6 bulk.</p>"
