      "value": "<p>A bypass subroutine is a miniaturized single-function computer which takes the form of a ring with four nanite circuit-nodes and can be sized to fit nearly any finger. The compact nanites are attuned to input from the circuit-nodes and can form specific tools much larger than the ring itself as directed by information stored within the circuit-node. Infiltrators utilize these high-tech metal bands to assist in covert missions. Aspis Consortium agents also use these rings to ensure that locks that were opened appear as if they were never tampered with.<br /><br />When you succeed at a Computers or Engineering check to open a lock, you can activate the ring as a reaction. The ring then stores a record of the processes and tools used in opening the lock, and one of the nanite circuit-nodes on the ring takes on a texture or color associated with the area around the lock. As a move action, you can touch the ring to a lock recorded therein and it recreates the conditions needed to change the lock's status (creating any required tool output with nanites), either opening or relocking that lock.<br /><br />A bypass subroutine can record one lock in each of its circuit-nodes. Any additional recordings must replace one of the four already in the ring.</p>",
