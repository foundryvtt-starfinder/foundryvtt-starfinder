If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the intimidation effect. A target affected by the intimidation critical hit effect is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). A creature that gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} condition from a weapon with the ominous fusion can’t gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.</p>"
