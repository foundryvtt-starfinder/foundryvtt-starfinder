      "value": "<p>This handheld, organic drum-shaped device uses organs similar to those many aquatic and avian species use to detect electrical activity. Using an electrosensory drum is a move action. The drum operates by using blindsense (electricity) with a range of 20 feet. Targets are displayed on the drum&rsquo;s softly glowing surface, along with their range and distance. An electrosensory drum generates its own energy that powers it for 60 minutes per day. Each use, no matter how short, consumes 1 minute of this time.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;1/hour</p>",
