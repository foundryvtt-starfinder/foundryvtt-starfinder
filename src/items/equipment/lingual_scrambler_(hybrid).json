      "value": "<p>This system of miniature microphones, speakers, and advanced circuitry covers your ears. You can activate or deactivate the scrambler as a move action. While activated, you can hear most sounds normally, but the device scrambles all speech into incomprehensible nonsense, and you are treated as though you didn’t understand any languages. This makes you immune to all language-dependent abilities, regardless of whether they are being used by allies or enemies. Telepathic abilities and other forms of communication that don’t rely on intelligible speech affect you normally. For example, an envoy using the universal expression envoy improvisation can affect you with envoy improvisations that are normally language-dependent.</p>",
