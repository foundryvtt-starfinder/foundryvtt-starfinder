If you&rsquo;re wearing no armor (or armor that has no armor check penalty), the light illuminates a 20-foot radius with normal light, and your radiance grants you concealment in bright light conditions. For every 1 point of AC penalty your armor imposes, the miss chance this effect provides decreases by 5%, and the light radius decreases by 5 feet (providing neither light nor a miss chance for armor check values of &ndash;4 or greater). This light doesn&rsquo;t provide you enough concealment to hide. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</span> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Serums</h2>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum&rsquo;s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
