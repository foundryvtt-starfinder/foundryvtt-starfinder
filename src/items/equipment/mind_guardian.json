After this, if the ring is not worn for 24 hours or longer, the mental patterns collapse and must be reestablished.</p>\n<p>The lashuntas of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} devised the&nbsp;mind guardians&nbsp;to protect the less mentally adept against outside control. @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android} engineers particularly skilled in the construction of self-aware neural networks assisted in the design. While most commonly found as a ring, a mind guardian can take the form of any compact piece of jewelry or personal adornment, but it functions only when in direct contact with the body.</p>"
