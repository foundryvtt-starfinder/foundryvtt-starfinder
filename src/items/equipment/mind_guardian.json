Once per day when you first come under the control of a mind-affecting effect, such as&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.SysRFlYml1f1Eofd]{Charm Monster}&nbsp;or&nbsp;dominate person, you can act normally for the first round of the effect, after which you are staggered for 1d4 rounds and affected by the mind-affecting effect as normal.<br /><br />You must wear a&nbsp;mind guardian&nbsp;at least 12 hours a day for 7 consecutive days before you can use its ability. After this, if the ring is not worn for 24 hours or longer, the mental patterns collapse and must be reestablished.<br /><br />The lashuntas of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} devised the&nbsp;mind guardians&nbsp;to protect the less mentally adept against outside control. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android} engineers particularly skilled in the construction of self-aware neural networks assisted in the design. While most commonly found as a ring, a mind guardian can take the form of any compact piece of jewelry or personal adornment, but it functions only when in direct contact with the body.</p>",
