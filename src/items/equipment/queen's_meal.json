Temples there normally produce large quantities of this meal on feast days, often at a discounted price. A queen’s meal is not only a day’s worth of food and water, but it also makes coordination and collaboration more effective and discourages hostility for 24 hours. While benefiting from a queen’s meal, you take a –1 penalty to your attack rolls, but you gain a +1 divine bonus to your EAC, KAC, Perception checks, and Sense Motive checks. In addition, if you attempt to aid another creature that has also eaten a queen’s meal that day, you apply a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. If you succeed, the highest result between you and the creature you’re aiding can be used to determine the aided check’s outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These cooperative effects have led to a tradition among followers of Hylax who work as diplomats or negotiators. They consume a queen’s meal at the start of talks to encourage peace. This practice was an element of the famous shirren-led peace negotiations between Castrovel’s formians and lashuntas.</p>\n<p><em>Enable/Disable modifiers in the Modifiers tab.</em></p>"
