The surveyor features a small dish that transmits and receives a signal to the target, as well as a view screen and speaker that relay the device&rsquo;s findings to you. The device allows you to employ both the audio and visual versions of clairaudience/clairvoyance simultaneously at a planetary range once per day, for a maximum duration of 10 minutes.</p>"
