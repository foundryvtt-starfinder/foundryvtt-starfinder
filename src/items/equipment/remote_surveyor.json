The surveyor features a small dish that transmits and receives a signal to the target, as well as a view screen and speaker that relay the device’s findings to you. The device allows you to employ both the audio and visual versions of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.4Z6WeMM9uJ1U0wG6]{Clairaudience/Clairvoyance} simultaneously at a planetary range once per day, for a maximum duration of 10 minutes.</p>"
