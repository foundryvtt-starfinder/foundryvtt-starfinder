An intoxicantâ€™s potency can be minor or superior. A minor intoxicant might be beer or wine, which takes a few servings to cause any physiological effects. A superior intoxicant is usually a strong spirit, such as whiskey, that can start producing effects after a single serving. Unlike @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drugs}, intoxicants are usually not addictive, although a GM might rule that a PC who partakes of too much of an intoxicant on a regular basis might begin to suffer the effects of an addictive @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drug} (as described in @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} on page 417).</p>"
