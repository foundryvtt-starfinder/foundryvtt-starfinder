Xhinti tool kits include the following: a climbing kit (grants a +4 bonus to Athletics checks when climbing), demolitionist’s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Engineering checks when arming and disarming explosives), linguist’s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Culture checks when deciphering writing), portable weather station (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks when predicting the weather), starship repair kit (grants a +4 bonus to Engineering checks when repairing the hull of a starship), and <strong>survivalist’s kit</strong> (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks when enduring severe weather or living off the land). When using a demolitionist’s kit or starship repair kit for its specialized purpose, you don’t take the –2 penalty to Engineering checks if you don’t have an engineering kit.</p>"
