      "value": "<p>A wrist leech is a dark red, sluglike life-form about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch in thickness; one end of the creature ends in a circular sucker with tiny teeth. The leech can be applied to an individual’s skin, whereupon it attaches and begins sucking the individual’s bodily fluids. The wrist leech’s carefully designed physiology then filters the blood, removing toxins and other harmful chemicals from the bloodstream before returning it to the host’s body. An individual with an attached wrist leech gains a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against any injury affliction. A wrist leech requires no battery, but survives for only 4 hours once placed on the skin before it shrivels up and dies.</p>\n<p>Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>"
