You can’t activate these glands while you’re wearing armor that isn’t fitted to you. Activating this augmentation requires a full action. While you are transformed, your size increases by one size category. If you become Large or larger, your reach increases by 5 feet, the amount of Bulk you can carry before being encumbered increases by 2, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to destroy an object using Strength (Core Rulebook 409). The effect of the glands lasts 1 minute. You must rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points to reactivate the glands or spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge them immediately.</p>"
