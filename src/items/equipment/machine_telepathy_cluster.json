The machine telepathy cluster is among the most common, as it allows the user to interface with technology&mdash;and spectra&mdash;telepathically. This both facilitates communication with the strange outsiders and grants creatures an increased ability to create technological marvels of their own.</p>\n<p>This clump of artificial synapses allows you to attempt&nbsp;Computers checks to access unsecured systems (or systems to which you already have access) within 10 feet. You can&rsquo;t use this augmentation to attempt any other Computers checks. You can also communicate with spectra within 50 feet as though you had the spectra&rsquo;s machine telepathy special ability, and when crafting items that require Computers or Engineering, you treat your number of ranks in those skills as 1 higher.</p>"
