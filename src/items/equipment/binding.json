A <em>binding</em> weapon gains the bind critical hit effect. When you score a critical hit on a target, you gain a +2 bonus to grapple checks you make against that target until the end of your next turn. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the binding critical hit effect when you score a critical hit. You can add this fusion only to melee weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>",
