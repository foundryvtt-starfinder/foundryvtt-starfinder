All but the most traditional and classical instruments use modern technology to amplify their sound, provide musical accompaniment, or connect wirelessly to other instruments in a band or orchestra.</p>\n<p>These instruments are specifically designed to stir nearby listeners with thrumming chords and subliminal riffs that most races find uplifting. While playing an activated euphonic musical instrument, you can attempt a DC 20 Profession (musician) check as a move action; on a success, you can suppress the fascinated or shaken condition on allies within 30 feet for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your check exceeds the check’s DC. This doesn’t change the duration of the condition; if the duration would continue after your uplifting performance ends, the ally immediately regains the condition that was suppressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 80;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/10 minutes</p>"
