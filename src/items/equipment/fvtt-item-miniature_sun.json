      "value": "<p>A photonic inducer set in a brass-frame inset with glass similar to a lantern, a miniature sun is a portable light that exudes an area of bright light in a 30-foot radius. Thanks to a comfortable insulated handle, it requires only one hand to hold. After 1 minute of use, the exterior of a miniature sun becomes incredibly hot to the touch. When it is this hot, you can use a miniature sun as an improvised melee weapon that deals 1d3 fire damage, but each successful attack made in this way deals twice as much damage to the item, ignoring hardness.<br /><br />A miniature sun requires only one hand to operate, uses a battery, and consumes 1 charge per each hour of use (or fraction thereof).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/hour</p>",
