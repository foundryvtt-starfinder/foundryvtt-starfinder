You can extend or retract these lenses as a swift action. While you have the lightvision shades active, you treat light levels of normal light and brighter as if they were areas of dim light. In addition, while the shades are active, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} condition.&nbsp;</span></p>",
