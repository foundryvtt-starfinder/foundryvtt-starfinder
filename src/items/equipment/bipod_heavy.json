You can extend or collapse a bipod as a move action. Also as a move action, you can stabilize your weapon by resting an extended bipod on a solid surface or using the bipod as a forward grip. When you fire the stabilized weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range according to the bipod’s type. You can’t benefit from a bipod if your weapon is mounted to a gunner harness (see page 60) or powered armor.</p>\n<p>Reduce your total penalty by 2, or by 1 with a heavy weapon. In addition, a stabilized heavy bipod reduces the minimum Strength score required to fire a heavy weapon without penalty by 2.</p>"
