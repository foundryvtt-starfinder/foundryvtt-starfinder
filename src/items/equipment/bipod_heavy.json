You can extend or collapse a bipod as a move action. Also as a move action, you can stabilize your weapon by resting an extended bipod on a solid surface or using the bipod as a forward grip. When you fire the stabilized weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range according to the bipod&rsquo;s type. You can&rsquo;t benefit from a bipod if your weapon is mounted to a gunner harness (see page 60) or powered armor.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\">Reduce your total penalty by 2, or by 1 with a heavy weapon. In addition, a stabilized heavy bipod reduces the minimum Strength score required to fire a heavy weapon without penalty by 2.</span></p>",
