      "value": "<p>Bolidas can protect themselves in combat by rolling into a nearly impenetrable ball. This augmentation segments your own spinal column (or similar system) to allow you similar flexibility. As a move action, you condense your body into a spherical shape. While rolled up in this way, you can only uncurl as a move action or take the total defense action (whereupon the bonus you receive to your AC increases to +5). This augmentation works well with the rolling charge graft (page 146), though that augmentation isn&rsquo;t required.</p>"
