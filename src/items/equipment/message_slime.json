      "value": "<p>Message slime is a transparent, programmable ooze that comes in an egg-shaped container and is used to deliver clandestine or surprise messages. Any creature with a personal comm unit or other computer can use it to program a message slime with a message up to 5 minutes in length&mdash;including both audio and visual components&mdash;and requirements that activate the slime&rsquo;s message. The criteria for activating the message must be simple and detectable with vision or hearing. For example, the slime might be programmed to activate as soon as a creature comes within 30 feet, or as soon as a shirren says the word &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; The slime is then spread on a surface, such as a wall, countertop, or door. As soon as the activating conditions are met, the slime&rsquo;s surface displays its message. Message slime that has not yet been activated can be detected with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Once spread over a surface, message slime cannot be reprogrammed. It continues to play its message every time it is activated for 1 month or until removed. After this time, the slime dries into an inert, flaky substance.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>",
