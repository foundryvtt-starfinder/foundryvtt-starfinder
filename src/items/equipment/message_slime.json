      "value": "<p>Message slime is a transparent, programmable ooze that comes in an egg-shaped container and is used to deliver clandestine or surprise messages. Any creature with a personal comm unit or other computer can use it to program a message slime with a message up to 5 minutes in length—including both audio and visual components—and requirements that activate the slime’s message. The criteria for activating the message must be simple and detectable with vision or hearing. For example, the slime might be programmed to activate as soon as a creature comes within 30 feet, or as soon as a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.Item.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} says the word “hello.” The slime is then spread on a surface, such as a wall, countertop, or door. As soon as the activating conditions are met, the slime’s surface displays its message. Message slime that has not yet been activated can be detected with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Once spread over a surface, message slime cannot be reprogrammed. It continues to play its message every time it is activated for 1 month or until removed. After this time, the slime dries into an inert, flaky substance.</p>\n<p>Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>"
