As a standard action, you can target any creature of your type that you are observing to gain split-second predictions for as long as you continue to observe it or until you deactivate your augmentation as a swift action. During this time, you gain a +1 insight bonus to saving throws and skill checks against that creature and against effects that creature produces. In addition, if you concentrate as a move action, you gain a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls against that creature until the beginning of your next turn.
