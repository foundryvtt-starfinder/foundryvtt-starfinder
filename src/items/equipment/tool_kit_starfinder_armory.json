The following tool kits supplement those presented on page 221 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook&nbsp;and provide circumstance bonuses to one or more skills in specific situations. These tool kits include the following: animaltrainer&rsquo;s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks to handle an animal or rear a wild animal), astrogator&rsquo;s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Piloting checks to navigate or astrogate), aura-translation kit (grants a +4 bonus to Mysticism checks to identify a magic item), broad-spectrum scanning kit (grants a +4 bonus to Perception checks to search), light-scattering sniper&rsquo;s blind (grants a +4 bonus to Stealth checks when sniping), mental interpretation kit (grants a +4 bonus to Sense Motive checks to discern a secret message out of combat), personal gravitational redistributor (grants a +4 bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance out of combat), and thieves&rsquo; tools (grants a +4 bonus to Computers checks to hack a computer system that controls a door and a +4 bonus to Engineering checks to disable a mechanical or technological lock). When using a thieves&rsquo; tools tool kit for its specialized purpose, you don&rsquo;t take the &ndash;2 penalty to Engineering checks if you don&rsquo;t have an engineering kit.</p>"
