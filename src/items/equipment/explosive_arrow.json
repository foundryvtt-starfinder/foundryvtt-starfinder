A weapon firing explosive ammo deals its normal amount of damage, but half of this damage is fire damage and grants the weapon the knockdown critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, the knockdown critical hit effect is added and considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect. If the weapon normally already has the knockdown critical hit effect, it instead gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Push} (5 feet) critical hit effect in addition to knockdown, and this considered part of the weapon’s normal critical hit effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 20</p>"
