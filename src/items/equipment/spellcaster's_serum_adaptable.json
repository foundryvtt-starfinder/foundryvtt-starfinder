Drinking a spellcaster’s serum fills you with additional magical energy that you can use to enhance the next spell you cast. This energy lasts until the end of your next turn. If you don’t cast a spell in this time, this magical energy is wasted with no effect. A spell can be modified by only one spellcaster’s serum at a time and each spellcaster’s serum can modify only one spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptable (Level 5; 480 credits)</strong>: An adaptable spellcaster’s <span>serum continuously changes colors. The first time you cast a spell while this serum is in effect, you can change that spell’s damage type. If the spell targets EAC or deals energy damage, you can change the spell’s damage type to one of the following of your choice: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. If the spell targets KAC or deals physical damage, you can change the spell’s damage type to one of the following of your choice: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. If the spell doesn’t deal damage, the spell is unaffected by the effects of this serum.</span></p>"
