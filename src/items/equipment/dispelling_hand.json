As a reaction, you can gain a +1 insight bonus to your AC against a spell that requires a successful attack roll. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can use dispel magic as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your level, but it can’t counter spells and it can’t target anything other than you unless you touch the target. To affect an unwilling target, you must hit it with a melee attack against its EAC; you activate the augmentation as part of the attack roll, and you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher. Once you use dispel magic this way, you can’t use your dispelling hand for either of its uses until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge it immediately.</p>"
