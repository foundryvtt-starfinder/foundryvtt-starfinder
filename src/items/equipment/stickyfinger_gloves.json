In second mode, the activated cilia provide exceptional grip, increasing your KAC against disarm combat maneuvers by 1. In third mode, the gloves grant a +2 circumstance bonus to Slight of Hand checks to palm an object, reduce the DC of Sleight of Hand checks to pick pockets by 4, and allow you to attempt these checks untrained.</p>"
