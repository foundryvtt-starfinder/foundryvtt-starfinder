      "value": "<p>A falsebond tattoo is designed to specifically mimic the partner bond between a dragonkin creature and a nondragonkin creature, such as that experienced between many members of the Skyfire Legion. Falsebond tattoos come in pairs (with matching designs) and must be purchased and applied at the same time; the listed price is for two tattoos. The tattoos can be applied to any nonmindless creature regardless of its type. Once applied, a mystical link is formed between the recipients of the two tattoos. These creatures can communicate with each other as if they had @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#telepathy]{Telepathy} with a range of 100 feet. In addition, once per day, linked creatures that are within 30 feet of each other can roll initiative checks separately and treat the higher result as the result for both of them. However, when the creatures use this benefit, their brainwaves become so in sync that they might be overwhelmed with sensory information; each creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition for 1 round.</p>\n<p>A falsebond tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. Most dragonkin, ryphorians, and members of the Skyfire Legion view these tattoos as perversions of a sacred bond and, at the GM’s discretion, a character wearing a falsebond tattoo takes a –4 circumstance penalty to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.1tzIBDaDAO4hmX5C]{Diplomacy} checks when interacting with such individuals. You can attempt to hide a falsebond tattoo with a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.aayAhTaRzitONs5U]{Disguise} check opposed by any onlookers’ @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} checks; this counts as altering a minor detail (Core Rulebook 140).</p>"
