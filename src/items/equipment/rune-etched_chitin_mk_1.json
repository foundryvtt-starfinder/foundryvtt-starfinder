Each set of rune-etched chitin is inscribed with spells that have a combined level equal to the augmentation’s mark. You can be augmented with rune-etched chitin only if the spells inscribed onto it are spells you could learn and cast at your current level, though you don’t have to know them. You can cast each of the spells inscribed on the runeetched chitin once per day at a caster level equal to the augmentation’s level without using your own spell slots. You must have this augmentation implanted for at least 24 hours for it to function.</p>"
