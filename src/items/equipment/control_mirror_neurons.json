      "value": "<p>Neurons in your brain that would normally help you imagine what another person is experiencing are amplified magically, allowing you to decide what another creature does. As a full action, you can target any creature of your type that you are observing and attempt to control that individual. This functions as dominate person (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) for as long as you continue to observe the target, except establishing the effect doesn&rsquo;t require an attack roll, and no command you give the target can take more than a standard action to complete. Issuing a command is a move action. You can&rsquo;t target a creature again for 24 hours after it succeeds at its saving throw against this effect or the duration ends. Once you use your control mirror neurons, you can&rsquo;t use them again until you&rsquo;ve rested to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge them immediately.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.GNjydCBF9y9pELG6]{Dominate Person}</p>"
