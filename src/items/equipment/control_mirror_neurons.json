As a full action, you can target any creature of your type that you are observing and attempt to control that individual. This functions as <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.J14mFZezYHIGHVhO]{dominate person}</em> (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) for as long as you continue to observe the target, except establishing the effect doesn’t require an attack roll, and no command you give the target can take more than a standard action to complete. Issuing a command is a move action. You can’t target a creature again for 24 hours after it succeeds at its saving throw against this effect or the duration ends. Once you use your control mirror neurons, you can’t use them again until you’ve rested to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge them immediately.</p>"
