As long as you are not @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.OwZA6flUQPH0jPA0]{Encumbered}, while wearing scuba gear, you can move at your full land speed through water and similar fluids with a successful Athletics check to swim. In addition, the air tank allows you to breathe for up to 1 hour while submerged. Scuba gear does not provide any other @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections}. It takes 4 rounds to don or remove scuba gear. You can&rsquo;t wear scuba gear while wearing any type of armor.</p>",
