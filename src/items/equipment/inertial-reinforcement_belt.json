      "value": "<p>When activated, an inertial-reinforcement belt anchors you in place, protecting you against outside forces that would move you. This effect grants you a +4 bonus to your AC against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, consuming 1 charge per minute. If you fall from a height greater than 10 feet, the inertial-reinforcement belt automatically activates just prior to impact and reduces your falling damage by half, consuming 1 charge per die of falling damage. If the belt has fewer remaining charges than the number of dice, the damage is reduced only by a number of dice equal to the number of charges remaining. Damage from landing on hazardous objects such as spikes is not reduced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Capacity&nbsp;20;&nbsp;Usage&nbsp;Varies</p>"
