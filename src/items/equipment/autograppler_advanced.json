      "value": "<p>The autograppler is a high-power version of the standard tethering device and functions as a @Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.LfYPseAOCIBmSFlD]{grappler}, with one key exception: the autograppler houses a powerful winch that can retract its attached cable line, pulling its user along the cable.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic (Level 4):</strong> You can toggle the autograppler&rsquo;s winch to retract its cable as a move action, during which time the items usage rating increases to 3/minute. The device is strong enough to pull a Medium or smaller user up inclines at a speed of 20 feet per round, as if the user were climbing. If used to target a smaller object, the winch can also drag or hoist an object whose bulk is 10 or less; increase your bulk carried by an equal amount while moving an object in this way. If you successfully grapple a creature with the autograppler and activate the winch, you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver against the target with a +2 circumstance bonus, but only to move the target closer to you. If you fail the maneuver&rsquo;s melee check by 5 or more, you lose your grip on the autograppler, which lands in a space between you and the target 1d4 &times; 5 feet away from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced (Level 9):&nbsp;</strong>This functions as a basic autograppler except its winch is strong enough to pull targets that are Large or smaller. It retracts its attached cable at a speed of 40 feet per round and can hoist objects of up to 20 bulk.</p>"
