      "value": "<p>This small gun-shaped device uses acute microwave radiation to scramble the DNA of living creatures caught in its area of effect. It was accidentally invented by @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} scientists attempting to understand Swarm biology and turned into an effective nonlethal, albeit pain-inducing, weapon. While wielding a DNA scrambler in one-hand, you can activate it as a standard action, dealing 3d8 nonlethal damage to all living targets in a 30-foot cone as their DNA unravels. This causes a great deal of pain, imparting the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition on each living creature in the cone for 1 round. A creature who DC 19 Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and negates the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition. This is a pain effect.</p>"
