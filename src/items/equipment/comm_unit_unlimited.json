      "value": "<p>A personal comm unit is pocket-sized device that combines a minor portable computer (treat as a tier-0 computer with no upgrades or modules) and a cellular communication device, allowing wireless communication with other comm units in both audio- and text-based formats at planetary range (see page 272). A personal comm unit also includes a calculator, a flashlight (increases the light level one step in a 15-foot cone), and several entertainment options (including games and access to any local infospheres). You can upgrade a personal comm unit to function as some other devices (such as full computers and scanners) by spending credits equal to 110% of the additional device’s price.</p>\n<p>Comm units that function at system-wide and unlimited ranges aren’t as portable; they include built-in generators that provide the necessary amount of power. Short-term use of these units can be purchased in most major settlements (see page 234).</p>\n<p>See page 430 for more about Pact Worlds communications.</p>"
