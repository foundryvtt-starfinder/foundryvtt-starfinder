Drawing from the DNA of tardigrades and other creatures capable of surviving periods of time in inhospitable conditions, this augmentation lets you take a full action to enter a state of suspended animation in which you don&rsquo;t have to eat or breathe. While you&rsquo;re in this state, you&rsquo;re effectively unconscious. When you enter stasis, you can choose how long you want to remain in stasis or that you want to remain in stasis until specific conditions are met, such as the presence of food or breathable air. Stasis ends if you take damage.</span></p>"
