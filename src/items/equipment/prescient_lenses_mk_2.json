A pair of lenses has one charge, which is refreshed each day, and a creature can benefit from a single use of&nbsp;prescient lenses&nbsp;each day (with any subsequent attempt showing the same few seconds of time as the first daily use).&nbsp;Prescient lenses&nbsp;were originally as optical enhancements for the robotic anacites of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} and can be integrated into a robot for the listed price. Alternatively, they can be installed as a cybernetic eye augmentation for 1,000 additional credits.</p>\n<p>Mk 1: You can study the image in the lenses as a move action and gain a +1 insight bonus to a single attack roll, ability check, or skill check attempted before the start of your next turn. Attempting an attack roll or check expends the charge.</p>\n<p>Mk 2: These function as mk 1 prescient lenses, but you can instead roll the attack roll or check twice and take the better of the two results.</p>"
