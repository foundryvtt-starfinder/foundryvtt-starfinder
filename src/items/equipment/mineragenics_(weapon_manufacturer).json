      "value": "<p>The Mineragenics corporation is one of the smallest military manufacturers on Bretheda, though its operations have grown exponentially since the successful release of its Frozen Life weaponry line. The barathus who own this firm first experimented with exoskeletal modifications and variations on the armor plating barathus have used for millennia, but a side venture resulted in the development of simple weapons made from the same mineral deposits.</p><p>A Frozen Life weapon can be any non-powered kinetic melee weapon, and they all have the archaic weapon property regardless of whether the original weapon had that property. The weapons may not be powerful, but they are remarkably affordable; if the type of weapon was not already archaic, its price is 20% lower than normal.</p>",
