      "value": "<p>An anykey is a lock-picking device, consisting of a handle and a thin metal strip. As a standard action, you can insert the strip into a physical lock and activate the anykey. Doing so causes the device to analyze the lock and extrude polyfluid into the mechanism. The fluid then hardens. This process creates a key that reduces the DC of Engineering checks to open that lock by 10. Resetting the anykey takes a standard action.<br />An anykey comes with a charger that can take a standard battery and that holds the device when it&rsquo;s not in use. Each use of the anykey, including resetting it, takes 1 charge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/use</p>",
