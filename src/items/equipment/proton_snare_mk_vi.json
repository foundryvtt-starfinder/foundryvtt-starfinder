      "value": "<p>This disc-shaped device has multidirectional rollers on five points and a stiff cable with a large button on its end for activation. As a standard action, you may deploy theproton snareon solid ground up to 20 feet away. As a move action, you can activate the snare by stomping on or pressing the switch. The snare emits a 20-foot cone of high-intensity muon lasers upward. Incorporeal creatures within the cone must make a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the snare’s level) or be drawn into the trap, closing them inside, regardless of size. Trapped creatures are suspended, and don’t need to breathe, eat, or drink. The snare emits a loud alarm for one round if a trapped creature loses its incorporeal state, and then automatically opens and releases all contained creatures randomly into the spaces around it.</p>\n<p>Each version of the trap can affect only a certain CR of incorporeal creatures and trap up to a certain number of Hit Points. If multiple incorporeal creatures are in the trap cone, start with those closest to the trap when it’s activated, trapping those creatures and deducting their current Hit Points from the Hit Point capacity until the device reaches maximum. All remaining creatures are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Aproton snarecan’t be activated again until emptied (even if it’s not at capacity). Emptying aproton snarerequires a fullaction, and releases its contents randomly into either the spaces around it or another snare with available capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk VI (Level 20):</strong> Affects up to CR 25; unlimited HP capacity.</p>"
