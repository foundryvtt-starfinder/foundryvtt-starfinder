Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm&rsquo;s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The&nbsp;mindshield circlet&nbsp;is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br /><br />While wearing a&nbsp;mindshield circlet, you can&rsquo;t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can&rsquo;t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The&nbsp;mindshield circlet&rsquo;s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects. The creator of an effect must make a check, rolling 1d20 + caster level or CR against the DC to overcome your circlet&rsquo;s protection and affect you normally.<br /><br />Even at the height of the shirrens&rsquo; collective fear of the Swarm, mindshield circlets were a poor solution, as most @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} found the loss of their telepathic abilities to be too isolating to bear for long. The items retain utility, especially by species that don&rsquo;t rely on telepathy. Such species have copied the technology and make more use of these protective devices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic (Level 3):&nbsp;DC 14.</li>\n<li>Mk 1 (Level 7):&nbsp;DC 18.</li>\n<li>Mk 2 (Level 11):&nbsp;DC 22.</li>\n<li>Mk 3 (Level 15):&nbsp;DC 26.</li>\n<li>Mk 4 (Level 19):&nbsp;DC 30.</li>\n</ul>"
