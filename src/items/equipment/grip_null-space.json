You can combine grips by paying the combined price of the grips, but only if all grips are integrated into a weapon. Their benefits stack. The benefits of a grip depend on its type.</p>\n<p>A<em>null-space grip</em>must be integrated into a melee weapon or small arm. As a move action, you can activate the grip to pull the weapon into an extradimensional space, leaving only a disk 1-1/2 inches in diameter. This disk is easy to hide on your person, granting you a +4 circumstance bonus to your Sleight of Hand check to do so. Additionally, the disk might not be recognized as a weapon without Engineering or Mysticism and<em>detect magic</em>used together to identify the item. As a move action, you can squeeze the disk to return the weapon to normal form.</p>"
