      "value": "<h1>Map</h1>\n<p>Maps come in all shapes and sizes, and in varying degrees of quality as well. Most maps are digital files that can be downloaded onto a computer, but physical maps are also available. The prices listed on Table 1&ndash;31 are for both digital or physical maps. There are two broad categories of maps: survey and navigational. In addition, maps differ based on the size of the area they cover: local maps depict an area up to 1,000 square miles, regional maps depict an area up to 10,000 square miles, planetary maps depict an entire planet, and system-wide maps depict an entire star system.<br /><br />A map grants you a circumstance bonus to Survival checks perform the orienteering task or Piloting checks to navigate within the region detailed by the map; survey maps grant a +1 bonus, and navigational maps grant a +2 bonus. You gain the bonus for using a map only if you are traveling directly through the area depicted by the map. For instance, you gain no bonus from a planetary map when navigating on foot through the streets of a settlement, but you would gain the bonus when plotting a course to a different location on that planet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListOtherItems_ctl00_LabelName\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Survey maps are usually made when an area is first discovered and surveyed. They describe the general shape and features of the region but lack detail and precision.</span></strong></p>"
