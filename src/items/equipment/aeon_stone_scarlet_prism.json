The aeon stone cannot be immediately recharged by spending a Resolve Point, but while its charge is spent, it provides its user with fire resistance 5 that applies only against laser attacks. When a laser attack inflicts enough damage to the user to bypass this resistance, the aeon stone immediately becomes recharged, no longer providing resistance until it is discharged again.&nbsp;</span></p>",
