When this effect triggers, the target’s worn and wielded technology, including weapons without the analog special property, armor @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections}, powered armor, and technological and hybrid items, cease functioning for 1 round. A technological construct struck by this effect must succeed at a Reflex save or be staggered for 1 round. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the EMP effect.</p>"
