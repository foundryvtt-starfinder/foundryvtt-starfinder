      "value": "<p>This mask of dark stone is just large enough to fit over the nose and mouth of a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}, although it has a hole about an inch across in the center. A ring of brassy metal, an alloy of djezet and mithral, surrounds this hole on the mask&rsquo;s outside. The mask counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />As a standard action while wearing the mask, you can forcefully inhale. If you do so, creatures that need to breathe within a 30-foot-radius spread of you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or become short of breath, rendering them fatigued for 1 minute. You can exclude any number of creatures from this effect. Environmental protections offer no benefit against this effect. A target @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} by the mask can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending that condition on itself if successful. A target that succeeds at such a save still remains fatigued for the full duration.<br /><br />Once you use this item, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest during which you could regain Stamina Points. If you use any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask, you can&rsquo;t use another for the same period. If you try to use any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask&nbsp;more than three times per day, the mask targets you and every breathing creature it can within range of its power. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate the mask without being subjected to these limitations, but you can spend no more than 2 Resolve Points per day to activate any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask.</p>",
