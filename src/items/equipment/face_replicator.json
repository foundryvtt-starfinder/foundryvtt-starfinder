      "value": "<p>The face replicator is a fast-acting 3D printer designed to create startlingly realistic full-head masks. Creating a mask requires 500 UPBs and takes 30 minutes, and the replicator requires a dataset (such as a hologram, photograph, or highly detailed sketch) to work from. The created mask blends seamlessly into your head and neck when worn, enabling you to change your appearance without using a disguise kit. In addition, yo<span class=\"fontstyle0\">u can use the mask to take the appearance of the specific creature on which the mask was modeled, applying the Disguise DC modifiers for disguising yourself as a different race, creature type, or size category as normal.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">face replicator </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">can print as many masks as you have time and UPBs, but a mask can be worn only once. Removing the mask irreparably damages it, and the mask deteriorates after being worn for 48 hours.</span></p>"
