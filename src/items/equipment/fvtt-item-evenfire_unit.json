      "value": "<p>Crafted of chemicals found on sweltering jungle worlds, this dull-brown cylindrical unit is no larger than a datapad. When an evenfire unit is activated, an electric current causes the chemicals to emit steady heat, but not light, within a 30-foot radius. Over 1 minute, the temperature of this area increases by 60&deg; F, to a maximum of 80&deg; F. The effects of multiple active evenfire units do not stack. This heat dissipates once the unit is shut off. An evenfire&rsquo;s heat is consistent throughout the area and is no hotter closer to the unit than at the edge of its area of effect. Anyone in the heated area gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers. In moderate or strong winds, an evenfire&rsquo;s temperature increase is reduced to 30&deg; F, and the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves is reduced to +1.<br /><br />In severe or stronger winds, an evenfire unit provides no temperature increase or save bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>",
