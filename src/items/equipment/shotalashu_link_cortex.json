The lashuntas have also maintained traditional gear for shotalashu riding.</p>\n<p>Until recently, only telepathic races with training in how to link their inherent telepathic abilities to shotalashus have been able to consistently form psychic bonds with the beasts. New developments in biotechnology have allowed less-trained telepaths and even non-telepathic members of other races to do so. Using a graft of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashunta} brain cells into the your body, you can replicate a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.ShWYksP7IwWcqEVa]{Lashunta}’s limited telepathy, though only in the capacity to link with a shotalashu. This reduces the DC of all Survival skill checks to form the link by 5, but doubles the duration of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.2XWEujYSyryB4oHm]{Dazed} condition and damage taken to either the bonded shotalashu or you, should one of you die.</p>"
