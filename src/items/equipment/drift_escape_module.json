      "value": "<p>This upgrade adapts and miniaturizes Drift engine technology into a single-use emergency escape mechanism. You can activate the upgrade as a full action to perform one of two effects while youâ€™re in the Drift. The first option is to have the upgrade eject you from the Drift and deposit you on a random planet or similar celestial body in Near Space or the Pact Worlds (the Vast lacks enough Drift beacons). The upgrade simultaneously sends a distress message along with your new coordinates to a comm unit of your choice; you can set a different message and recipient with 5 minutes of work.</p>\n<p>The second option causes the upgrade to predict a nearby Drift region likely to have starship traffic, then teleports you there and activates a midrange general distress beacon. Under most circumstances, a passing starship notes and answers the beacon within 3d20 hours.</p>\n<p>Either use destroys the module after it fulfills its purpose, its energy drained and many parts melted from the strain.</p>"
