      "value": "<p>This thick industrial cable of woven plastic contains special chains of chemicals that contract, expand, and twist when they receive electronic signals. A length of smart cable has a narrow battery pack near one end. When you activate the cable, you can change its shape by sending signals from a datapad or comm unit. You can command the smart cable to coil, uncoil, tie itself around objects, or go rigid. In addition, you can cause periodic sections of the cable to crimp, allowing creatures to treat it as a knotted rope for the purposes of using Athletics to climb. Commanding a smart cable requires a move action.<br /><br />When inactive or out of charges, a smart cable cannot receive commands and is identical to an adamantine alloy cable line, except that its hardness and Hit Points are based on its level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;</strong>4,000/10 ft.</p>",
