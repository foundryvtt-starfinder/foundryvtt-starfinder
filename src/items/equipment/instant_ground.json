Following the Swarm&rsquo;s attack on Atachuuva, survivors use instant ground to create patches of land to serve as new homes.&nbsp;Instant ground&nbsp;is water resistant but still somewhat biodegradable as a few of Atachuuva&rsquo;s oversized insect species have developed a taste for it.<br /><br />Each container holds a biochemical powder mixed with magically charged particles from the Plane of Earth. When poured into water as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the components react swiftly to form a stable, buoyant platform in a 5-foot radius, provided the amount of water large enough to allow this expansion. If the body of water is smaller than the resulting ground area,&nbsp;instant ground&nbsp;consumes the available water and fills the available space. Any remaining powder is rendered inert. The landmass is a hemisphere with its dome pointed downward, so the ground is flat and stays upright on rough water.</p>"
