      "value": "<p>Until it is activated, a multiverse mirror functions as normal full-length mirror. When activated, the reflective surface vibrates slightly, blurring the image. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute focusing on an activated mirror while contemplating a skill in which you have no ranks. As you do so, the image comes into focus, showing you a different version of yourself (presumably from an alternate reality) who is trained in that skill. The quantum energy released via the mirror briefly entangles you with this parallel self. Until the next time you take a full night&rsquo;s rest, you can attempt one check with the chosen skill as if you had a number of ranks in that skill equal to your level. For that same period of time, the first time you roll a natural 20 for a skill check in a skill you are trained in, you must reroll that check and take the second result.</p>",
