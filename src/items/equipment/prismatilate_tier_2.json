      "value": "<h2>Deep Indigo Extract</h2>\n<p>Scientists who survived early encounters with enigmas took samples of the sparkling, rainbow-hued organic matter—nicknamed deep indigo— that threatened osiferns expel. This material has inspired numerous medical developments, especially ones that harness osiferns’ regenerative properties. While osifern sprouts contain the same chemicals needed to produce these medicinal extracts, they yield such small quantities that harvesting enough to create even a single dose has proven inefficient, though not impossible. Deep indigo extract follows the rules for medicinals presented on pages 231–232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook; two examples are described below.</p>\n<h3>Cytoguard</h3>\n<p>Similar to an antitoxin, cytoguard actively regenerates cellular damage, mitigating the immediate effects of poison. When you take or are injected with cytoguard, you gain resistance equal to 3 times the medicinal’s tier to the damage dealt by initial exposure to poison. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal’s tier to saving throws against poison. Both effects last for a number of hours equal to the medicinal’s tier.</p>\n<h3>Prismatilate</h3>\n<p>A prismatilate extract releases a steady dose of endorphins and regenerative agents that encourage long-term recovery. When you take or are injected with prismatilate, you gain a bonus (equal to 2 + the medicinal’s tier) to saving throws to remove negative levels. In addition, you increase the number of HP you recover from a full night’s rest or complete bed rest by 25% times the medicinal’s tier. Both effects last for 24 hours.</p>"
