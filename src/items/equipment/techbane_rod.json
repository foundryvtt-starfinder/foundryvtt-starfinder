These rods appeared during the Gap, likely created by spellcasters as an answer to rapidly expanding technology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you can touch a techbane rod to an unattended technological or hybrid item, weapon, or armor. If such an object fits inside a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a creature is holding or wearing the object, you must succeed at a melee attack roll against the creature’s EAC to hit the target object. Alternatively, if a creature is wearing the object, you can use the techbane rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming DR) to hit the wearer and the target object. If your attack hits, the object must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as normal, but the bearer can use its Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can instead touch the rod to a creature that has the technological subtype, targeting EAC, or you can use the rod as a magic club against such a creature. If your attack hits, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or become staggered and unable to use energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A creature can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw at the end of its turn each round to end the effect early.</p>"
