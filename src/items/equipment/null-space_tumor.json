      "value": "<p>While it is rare, some adventurers claim that exposing a null-space chamber to powerful teleportation magic (such as plane shift) can result in an unusual metallic growth appearing within the chamber. Scholars have yet to determine the true nature of these anomalies, which they call null-space tumors. A null-space tumor seems to have no obvious use or purpose, and merchants might sell you a null-space chamber with one inside without realizing it. The listed price and level is for a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.O4a06t4zqSGarHUr]{mk 1 null-space chamber} with a null-space tumor inside; rumors persist that larger and more disruptive null-space tumors exist. A null-space tumor has 1 bulk and can’t be permanently removed from its associated chamber. You can’t purposefully call up a null-space tumor from its chamber, but each time you call up another item from the chamber, there is a 20% chance that the null-space tumor appears instead. When that happens, the tumor’s unusual properties randomly cause one of the following effects (roll 1d8 to determine the effect), after which the null-space tumor immediately teleports itself back into the chamber. The only way to destroy a null-space tumor is to destroy the null-space chamber it’s attached to.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 98.9362%; height: 146px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 18px; text-align: center;\"><strong>D8</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 18px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 16px;\">You and all your gear become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#invisible]{Invisible} for 1d4+1 rounds, but you move as if through a thick soup; your speed is reduced to 10 feet during this time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 16px;\">Duplicates appear around you, as if you were affected by the spell @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.qpyB7SxHlTBx0H6a]{Mirror Image} for 1d4 minutes.
