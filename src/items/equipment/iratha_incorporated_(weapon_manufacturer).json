      "value": "<p>Iratha Incorporated specializes in biotech augmentations, but the company has made a small ingress into the weapons industry by modifying armaments to include a biometric lock keyed to allow use only by authorized users. This lock functions like a biometric lock starship security system, but the DC uses the weapon’s item level in place of the starship’s tier. The biometric lock is integrated with a weapon’s activation mechanism and works by disabling that apparatus. Iratha Incorporated modifications increase the price of a weapon by 10%.</p>",
