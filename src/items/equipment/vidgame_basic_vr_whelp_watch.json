Some VR games are designed to enhance a player’s hand-eye coordination in addition to providing entertainment and prove so effective that some militaries use them as training devices. The two games listed here are sold separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Whelp Watch</strong>: A game with unique viral marketing from an anonymous video game studio on Vesk-3, this game puts players in the role of Veskarium employees who are trying to avoid being buried beneath skittermander whelps. These skittermander babies, who want to provide “helping hugs,” are being tossed at them from all sides as the employees walk home from work. The player must use different shields to harmlessly bounce the playful baby skittermanders away before they latch on and cannot be removed. Leveling up sees the player advance from using a bureaucrat’s clipboard, chair, beach umbrella, and eventually skittertank mech to accomplish this. After 1 hour spent playing Whelp Watch, you gain the benefit of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.feats.Item.cloPjyXmg0zrvKaR]{Shield Proficiency} feat (Character Operations Manual 118) for 1 hour.</p>"
