While the system is active, you gain a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws against effects that read your thoughts (such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.moyeAHT4yzZVWmmg]{detect thoughts}). Also, any creature contacting you with @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#telepathy]{telepathy} or reading your thoughts must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) or become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{dazzled} and unable to communicate with their telepathy for 1d4 rounds; if they’re concentrating on a spell that reads your thoughts, they lose concentration, potentially ending the spell. You can deactivate the node as a swift action. Once a creature successfully saves against your deception node, they’re immune to it for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>If you have two deception nodes installed, they provide you greater control over your mental chatter, and you can activate or deactivate both as a swift action. While both are active, the resistance bonus to saving throws increases to +3, and the DC to resist the nodes’ effect increases by 1. If a creature reading your thoughts fails the saving throw, rather than dazzling them and interrupting their concentration, you can instead provide false thoughts to the creature. Doing so functions as telling a lie using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.GcVVfpQ79HdcMqBt]{Bluff} skill, though you reduce any DC modifier from the creature’s attitude by 5 if they’re unfriendly or hostile.</p>"
