Drinking a spellcaster’s serum fills you with additional magical energy that you can use to enhance the next spell you cast. This energy lasts until the end of your next turn. If you don’t cast a spell in this time, this magical energy is wasted with no effect. A spell can be modified by only one spellcaster’s serum at a time and each spellcaster’s serum can modify only one spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Extending (Level 5; 480 credits)</strong>: An extending spellcasting serum is green. The first time you cast a spell while this serum is in effect, you extend its duration. If the spell has a duration that is increases by level and is measured in rounds, minutes, or hours, you add 1 to this duration. For example, a spell with a duration of 1 round/level would be increased by 1 additional round, while a spell with a duration of 1 hour/level would be increased by 1 additional hour.</p>"
