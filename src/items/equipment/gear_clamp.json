      "value": "<p>A gear clamp is designed to place a piece of equipment into an easily accessible position. This is often on a belt or the exterior of a suit of armor, but it can also place equipment in convenient locations when you are lurking in a tree or working in a zero-g environment. Affixing a gear clamp in place is a full action, but any object easily and conveniently held in one hand can be added to or removed from a gear clamp as easily as drawing or sheathing a weapon. Gear clamps are designed to have a trick release, with thousands of models each using a unique combination of clicks, spins, tugs, and twists to release attached gear. If you are not familiar with a specific clamps trick (by reading the instructions when you buy the clamp, having it demonstrated, or owning it and periodically testing its function), adding or removing equipment takes a full action. A successful DC 25 Strength check is required to separate material attached by a clamp.</p>"
