For every 5 minutes you spend running on the treadmill without interruption, you gain a circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves for 1 hour, up to a maximum of 12 hours. This bonus is +1 and increases to +2 at 10th level.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can rig a portable treadmill as trap as a full action.

A portable treadmill can be used continuously without expending charges if it is plugged into a starship or power grid.</p>"
