Physical books, made of paper or synthetic paper analogues, remain in use, but due to their bulk and weight, are normally found in the hands of eccentric collectors. While many physical books are quite old and treated as heirlooms, modern mass-printed versions are also available.</p>\n<p>The prices listed in Table 1â€“30 are for digital or physical books. Rare, ancient, collectible, or ornate physical books (especially holy texts) can command prices hundreds or thousands of times more than the listed price. The listed bulk is for physical books (though ancient books or particularly valuable holy texts often have a higher bulk); digital books have negligible bulk.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard books can be biographies, fiction, magical theory, scientific texts, technical manuals, and much more.</strong></p>"
