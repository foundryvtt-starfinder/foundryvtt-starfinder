      "value": "<p>Agimmickis a small, handheld item, usable only by spellcasters, that focuses their spellcasting in a unique way. When you cast a spell, you can channel the magic through onegimmickyou’re holding to alter the spell, both changingany perceptible manifestations and effects in a specific way based on thegimmick. Once used to modify a spell, agimmickcan’t be used again until after you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge an attunedgimmickwithout spending an action.</p>\n<p>Agimmickrequires time to attune to a new user, functioning only once it has been in your possession for at least 24 hours. However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attune to a newgimmickwith only 10 minutes of concentration. Once attuned to you, thegimmicktakes a shape of your choice that reflects your personality and spellcasting tradition, appearing as a wand, mystical orb, engineering tool, or the like. A gimmick can’t be shaped into a functioning weapon, though it can take a weapon-like appearance. A technomancer can turn agimmickinto their spell cache by performing an 8-hour ritual, though if thegimmickspell cache is lost or destroyed, a newly created spell cache no longer has thegimmick’s properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Devastating (Levels 2–14):</strong> Thisgimmickgives your damaging spells a small chance of inflicting devastating harm, giving the channeled spell a critical hit effect based on the spell’s damage type: corrode for acid damage, staggered for cold damage, arc for electricity damage, burn for fire damage, deafen for sonic damage, knockdown for bludgeoning or force damage, bleed for piercing damage, and wound for slashing damage. For a critical hit effect that deals additional damage, such as arc or bleed, the additional damage equals 1d6 per spell level (or 1d4 for a 0-level spell). If a spell deals multiple types of damage or would already apply a different critical hit effect, you can apply one of the applicable critical hit effects of your choice when you score a critical hit. If the channeled spell doesn’t require an attack roll but instead allows a saving throw to reduce its damage, you can apply the critical hit effect to one affected creature that rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw.</p>\n<p>Unlike with mostgimmicks, if the channeled spell does not score a critical hit against any target, then thegimmick’s power is not expended, and another spell can be channeled through it. The maximum level spell that adevastating gimmickcan modify is based on its model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apprentice (Level 2):</strong> Thegimmickcan modify a spell of 2nd level or lower.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Expert (Level 8):&nbsp;</strong> Thegimmickcan modify a spell of 4th level or lower.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Master (Level 14):</strong> Thegimmickcan modify a spell of any level.</li>\n</ul>"
