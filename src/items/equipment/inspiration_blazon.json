An inspiration blazon is a decorated medal or tabard that lets you lend your allies your Resolve.</p>\n<p>An <em>inspiration blazo</em>n must be worn prominently to function. When an ally within 60 feet of you spends Resolve Points, as a reaction while you are wearing an <em>inspiration blazon</em>, you can activate the blazon to inspire that ally, provided that you can see and be heard by the ally. You speak words of encouragement and spend up to 2 Resolve Points to reduce the number of Resolve Points your ally spends by the amount you spent, to a minimum of 0. The blazon has no effect on an ally who has no Resolve Points. An <em>inspiration blazon</em> can&rsquo;t affect a given ally again until that ally regains Resolve Points during an 8-hour rest.</p>"
