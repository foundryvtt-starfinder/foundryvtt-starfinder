A&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;scans the target’s memory and personality, collates and organizes that data, and presents on the control console a summary of key findings, which can then be transferred to a personal comm unit or other storage device. Reptoids use this information to adopt a perfect disguise, taking advantage of everything revealed, including dark secrets, passwords, the names of individuals important to the target, and more.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;must be used on a helpless, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing living creature, though it must also break down the creature’s subconscious defenses. After 1 minute of work, the creature can attempt a DC 19 Will saving throw to resist the&nbsp;mind scour’s mental probing. On a failure, the&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;learns five pieces of secret information, usually answers to questions chosen by the user and entered into the control console before the process began. If the creature is still helpless, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing, the mind scour user can keep the device running for an additional minute to learn more, although the creature can make another saving throw at the end of that minute. A creature that succeeds can’t be subjected to a&nbsp;mind scour’s probing for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;mind scour’s probing is a mind-affecting, divination effect. Using a&nbsp;mind scour&nbsp;on a helpless or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} creature is an evil act.</p>"
