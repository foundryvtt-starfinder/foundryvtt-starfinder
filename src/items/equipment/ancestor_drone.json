Some maraquoi have put a new twist on this tradition by creating drones to represent the ancestors instead. An ancestor drone is a Tiny, maraquoi-shaped @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.qlS0lRayx0Ah28fW]{domestic drone} (Armory 101) that functions as the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.tp8RpPeUbTgly8xZ]{hover drone} of a 1st-level mechanic with no drone mods. The drone features a small display screen in its chest, typically showing a curated array of short videos and images of several ancestors. Once per day, you can ritually pose a question to the ancestor drone, which channels fragmented wisdom from your departed family to answer you; this functions as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.uH3JWy7ICH8DNS8m]{augury} but doesnâ€™t require spending Resolve Points.</p>"
