For 1 hour after you consume a gravity serum, you treat your Strength as 4 higher for the purposes of determining how much you can carry. Furthermore, while in an area of high gravity, you can move at three-quarters your speed, jump three-quarters as far as normal, and lift three-quarters as much weight, rather than half your normal values. You also reduce the nonlethal bludgeoning damage dealt by extreme gravity environments by half.</p>\n<p><em>Enable/Disable modifiers in the Modifiers tab.</em></p><em></em><p><em></em></p>\n<h3>Serums</h3>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serumâ€™s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
