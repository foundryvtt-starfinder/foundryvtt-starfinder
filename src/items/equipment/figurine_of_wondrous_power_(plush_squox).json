      "value": "<p>Each&nbsp;figurine of wondrous power&nbsp;is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.</p>\n<p>Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.</p>\n<p>A figurine of wondrous power becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Plush Squox (Level 3):</strong> This stuffed toy can turn into a trained squox (Alien Archive 2118). Unlike mostfigurines of wondrous power, the figurine can transform into a squox for a total of 10 minutes per day, though the duration need not be used continuously and is expended in 1-minute increments. Wounds and damage received by the squox in its animate form translate to its figurine form when it reverts; if it dies, the plush figure appears torn and without stuffing. Theplush squoxdoes not heal in 24 hours as usual—you must repair the figurine using Engineering or an appropriate profession.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.alien-archives.ixCuJ9QcTdGbfy3Q]{Trained Squox}</p>"
