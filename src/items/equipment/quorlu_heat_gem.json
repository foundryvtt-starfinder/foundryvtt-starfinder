To remain comfortable in such environments, quorlus developed fieryhearted gems using magic harnessed from the Plane of Fire to provide themselves with temporary resistance to cold. As a standard action, you can swallow a quorlu heat gem. Quorlus find them tasty. However, most carbon-based species find the experience unpleasant but harmless. For 24 hours after swallowing a quorlu heat gem, you gain cold resistance 5. If any lethal cold damage penetrates this cold resistance, the effect ends.</p>"
