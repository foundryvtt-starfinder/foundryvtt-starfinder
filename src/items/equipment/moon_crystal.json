It also provides 4 days of environmental protections as if it were armor, and it can be activated and depleted in the same way. The crystal can also sense when you need its protection and activate itself even if you’re unable to take actions. As a standard action, a creature holding a&nbsp;<em>moon crystal</em>&nbsp;can determine the remaining duration of its environmental protections. As the duration nears its end, the light in the crystal dims, and the crystal goes dark when its magic is fully expended. The crystal then crumbles to dust.</p>"
