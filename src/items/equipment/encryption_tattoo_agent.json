When you are within 60 feet of a being with another encryption tattoo and activate your encryption tattoo with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The agent encryption tattoo is the standard type of encryption tattoo. Certain encryption tattoos, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: operative encryption tattoos provide DR 5/—, provocateur encryption tattoos provide DR 10/—, and master encryption tattoos provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.</p>\n<p>Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your encryption tattoo to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.</p>\n<p>An encryption tattoo doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. In addition, it can be installed in an android’s racial armor upgrade slot.</p>"
