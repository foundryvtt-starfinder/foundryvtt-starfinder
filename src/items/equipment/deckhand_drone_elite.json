      "value": "<p>This Small drone is designed to provide basic assistance aboard a starship or other large vessel, including supplemental computation for navigation or astrogation. Most deckhand drones resemble a squat box with stubby, clawed feet that allow it to keep its orientation in zero-g. A deckhand drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and tool arm (fire extinguisher) mods instead of the stealth drone’s normal initial mods. If an activated deckhand drone is accessible to a creature attempting a Piloting check to navigate, that creature reduces the time needed to plot a course by half (generally from 10 minutes to 5 minutes). Its skill unit is Computers. A deckhand drone has 6 bulk.</p>\n<p>An <strong>elite deckhand drone gains</strong> the skill subroutines (Engineering) mod and has an Intelligence score of 8 rather than 6. A deckhand drone can expend 5 charges of its battery to attempt to aid another to assist with the Engineering check to repair a starship’s hull (Core Rulebook 322). In addition, during starship combat, an elite deckhand drone can assist a ship’s engineer, reducing the DC of an engineer’s patch action by 5.</p>"
