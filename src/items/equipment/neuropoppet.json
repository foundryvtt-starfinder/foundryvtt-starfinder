      "value": "<p>A neuropoppet is a small simulacrum of a featureless humanoid creature, composed of a malleable eggshell-white polymer that is wirelessly linked to a tiny needle-shaped neural receiver. The receiver can be loaded into any ranged weapon that uses darts as ammunition, though it deals no damage to a target when fired (nor can it impose any critical hit effects). Instead, the receiver embeds into the target’s body, injecting a small numbing agent into the target’s bloodstream, making them unaware of the embedded receiver unless they or an adjacent ally succeeds at a Perception check (DC = the result of your attack roll to embed the receiver). Once found, the receiver can be removed with a standard action and a successful DC 30 Medicine check. The signal sent from a neuropoppet to the neural receiver can be jammed with a signal jammer.</p>\n<p>While the neural receiver is embedded in a living humanoid target within 60 feet, you can manipulate the neuropoppet as a full action with two hands (this uses up one of the item’s charges), causing the receiver to send subtle electrical signals through the target’s nervous system. You can then designate the target’s next standard action, chosen from the list below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempt a combat maneuver of your choice against the creature nearest to the target (determined randomly).</li>\n<li>Distract a creature of your choice using harrying fire.</li>\n<li>Take the total defense action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the target creature attempts the action you designate, it can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw. If the save is successful, the neural receiver sends a blast of haptic feedback to the neuropoppet, dealing 6d6 electricity damage to you (Reflex DC 25 half).</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/use</p>"
