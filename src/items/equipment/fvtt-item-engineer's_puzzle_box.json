      "value": "<p>This small box is covered with various circuits, electronic locks, gears, and other mechanisms that you must unlock or bypass in order to reach the box&rsquo;s hollow center. The mechanisms shift and rearrange automatically, allowing for a multitude of combinations to keep the box from opening. Once unlocked, the box resets itself and reorders the mechanisms, starting the process over. Using an engineer&rsquo;s puzzle box to improve your skills requires 1 hour and a DC 25 Engineering check. If you succeed at the check, you reduce the time required to disable devices using the Engineering skill by 2 rounds (to a minimum of 1 round). This bonus lasts for 24 hours. You can benefit from only one engineer&rsquo;s puzzle box at a time.<br /><br />Some engineering organizations and mechanics&rsquo; societies are known to put prizes or certificates in the center of an engineer&rsquo;s puzzle box as a final test for applicants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/hour</p>",
