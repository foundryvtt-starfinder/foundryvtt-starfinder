When you are about to enter a square containing any level of radiation and you are wearing a radiation badge, the badge beeps audibly to warn you. A radiation badge is always on and functions for 7 days before it needs to be recharged (much like the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} of a suit of armor with an item level of 1).&nbsp;</span></p>"
