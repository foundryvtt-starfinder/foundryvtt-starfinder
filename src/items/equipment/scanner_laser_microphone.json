Some specialized scanners can also provide other senses, such as blindsense or sense through, but these often require ongoing monitoring or impose other restrictions. Common examples include laser microphones, motion detectors, and x-ray visors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This handheld sensor allows you to hear through normally sound-impervious materials at great range. It grants you sense through (hearing) with a range of 120 feet, but only through materials that are 1 inch thick or thinner, and each Perception check attempted using it takes a full action, during which you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed}.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>"
