Sold as a matching set of two devices, these appear as small comm unit–sized keyboards with simple liquid crystal text displays. Thanks to the entangled quantum particles contained within, typing a 25-character message into one device instantly displays that message on all other paired devices up to a system-wide distance. Messaging in this way can’t be intercepted or traced. Multiple sets of quantograms can be linked together in a process taking 1 hour.</p>"
