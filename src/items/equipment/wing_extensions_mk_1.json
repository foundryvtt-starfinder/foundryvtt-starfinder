While the wings have an impressive wingspan when in use, they fold up neatly and can be hidden under loose clothing. When in use, wing extensions grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. They do not function in a thin atmosphere or vacuum, and can be used for up to 1 hour per day, in 10-minute increments. Mk 2 wing extensions function in thin atmospheres and vacuum, and include enchantments that allow you to ignore the hazardous environmental effects of outer space and vacuum.</p>"
