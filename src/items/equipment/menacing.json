When you hit an enemy with a melee attack using a <em>menacing</em> weapon, that enemy is considered flanked for all other melee attackers until the start of your next turn. This weapon fusion does not provide any benefit to your own attacks. Only melee weapons can benefit from the <em>menacing</em> fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
