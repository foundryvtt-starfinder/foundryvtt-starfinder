      "value": "<p>This loose mesh of wire and miniature holographic projectors is used to disguise the presence of creatures or objects. Holoshroud comes in 10-foot-by-10-foot square sheets. When you hide under an activated holoshroud, you gain a +2 insight bonus to Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering yourself with holoshroud is a full action requiring a successful DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the holoshroud and do not gain its bonus to Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using a holoshroud, except you do not take a penalty to initiative or Stealth checks from this condition. Taking off a holoshroud is a move action, or you can take off the holoshroud as part of the move action to stand up from a prone position. A creature with the blindsense ability ignores the effect of a holoshroud. You cannot hide under a holoshroud that is not activated; if the holoshroud runs out of charges while you are underneath it, you are visible as normal.<br /><br />You can spend 1 minute covering a Medium or smaller object with a holoshroud, making it appear to be a natural part of the surrounding terrain. For example, you can conceal a hoverbike as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two holoshrouds. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five holoshrouds and takes 10 minutes of work. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 holoshrouds and takes 1 hour of work. The DC of Perception checks to notice or search for an object covered by a holoshroud is increased by 10. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by holoshrouds automatically recognizes it as a camouflaged object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;1/hour</p>",
