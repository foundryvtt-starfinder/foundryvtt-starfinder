During this time, harmless tendrils of vegetation sprout from and wrap around the creature’s body, eventually encasing it in a thick podlike shell. When the creature wakes, it emerges from the pod cured of all ailments as if affected by a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.usqy3VusjjgEnM9N]{restoration} spell (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 374), except any permanent negative levels are restored in addition to temporary ones.</p>\n<p>Some conspiracy-minded individuals claim that germination serum is actually a bioweapon developed by some nefarious plant species and that the creatures who emerge from the pods are actually sinister duplicates of the creatures that went in, the originals having been fully digested during the interval. These rumors are almost certainly untrue.</p><h2>Serums</h2><p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
