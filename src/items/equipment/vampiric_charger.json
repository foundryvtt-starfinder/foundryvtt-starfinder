      "value": "<p>Carved to resemble a grotesque, bestial head, a&nbsp;vampiric charger&nbsp;has a wide maw with a pair of sharpened fangs serving as prongs. The charger converts life force into magical power and then into electricity.<br /><br />As a move action, you can insert a battery into the&nbsp;vampiric charger, and as another move action, you can stab the charger's fangs into a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.RxvbSB9ZgSCBu2jw]{Helpless} or willing creature. Your target loses 1d4+1 Hit Points, which can&rsquo;t be negated or mitigated in any way without causing the charger to fail. Every round thereafter, the creature takes 1 Constitution damage, and the battery attached to the charger regains 10 charges (up to its maximum). Once attached to a creature, the&nbsp;vampiric charger&nbsp;continues to inflict Constitution damage until it is removed or the creature dies, even if the battery is fully charged. A creature can remove the charger as a move action.<br /><br />Each time a battery is recharged in this way, it has a 20% chance to become corrupted. If the creature the charger is attached to dies while a battery is charging, that battery immediately becomes corrupted. Only a&nbsp;vampiric charger&nbsp;can recharge such a corrupted battery.</p>",
