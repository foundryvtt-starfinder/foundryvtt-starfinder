Your target loses 1d4+1 Hit Points, which can’t be negated or mitigated in any way without causing the charger to fail. Every round thereafter, the creature takes 1 Constitution damage, and the battery attached to the charger regains 10 charges (up to its maximum). Once attached to a creature, the&nbsp;vampiric charger&nbsp;continues to inflict Constitution damage until it is removed or the creature dies, even if the battery is fully charged. A creature can remove the charger as a move action.</p>\n<p>Each time a battery is recharged in this way, it has a 20% chance to become corrupted. If the creature the charger is attached to dies while a battery is charging, that battery immediately becomes corrupted. Only a&nbsp;vampiric charger&nbsp;can recharge such a corrupted battery.</p>"
