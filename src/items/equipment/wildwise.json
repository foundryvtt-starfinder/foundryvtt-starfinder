      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListBiotech_ctl00_LabelName\">The soft purple fungus called wildwise attaches itself to your vocal cords and extends fine filaments into portions of your brain. It allows you to communicate in a general sense with animals and with magical beasts with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. You can attempt Diplomacy checks to influence such creatures as well as understand in very vague terms information they try to convey to you. The information they give you usually consists of simple concepts such as “danger,” “food,” or “that way.”&nbsp;</span></p>",
