Traditional blankets are usually woven textiles, natural wool or fur from a variety of creatures, or synthetic fibers engineered for maximum comfort and warmth. Emergency or survival blankets are thin sheets of reflective polymer that both help you retain body heat and make you more visible to rescuers. Many people combine a blanket with a bedroll for greater comfort. Adventurers and explorers rely on the plethora of armor, weapons, and equipment available for sale and use in the galaxy. However, there are also a wide variety of personal items that are not strictly necessary but are nevertheless desired, for either their utility or their luxury. The following personal items are readily available in most places that sell gear. They are not considered technological or magical unless specified otherwise.</p>"
