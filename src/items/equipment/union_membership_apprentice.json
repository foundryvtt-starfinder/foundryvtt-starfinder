To get one, you must regularly pay the dues (listed below). Most unions provide digital proof of your membership, though some require you to carry a physical card (which has negligible bulk). An apprentice union membership grants a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to interact with individuals who also belong to unions and, once per month, allows you to roll your Profession check twice and take the better result when you perform the practice profession downtime activity. An artisan union membership increases the bonus to +2 and allows you to roll twice on your Profession check two times per month when you perform the practice profession downtime activity. A master union membership increases the bonus to +4 and allows you to roll twice on your Profession check whenever you perform the practice profession downtime activity.</p>"
