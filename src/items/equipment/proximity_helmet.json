      "value": "<p>This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but your mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted faceplate provides a heads-up display when activated, and while the helmet is activated, its external motion sensors pick up on sudden movements and subtle visual cues, granting you a +2 insight bonus to Perception checks to notice moving targets within 60 feet. A secondary setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a chirping sound near your ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although a creature undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) does not trigger the alarm. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door and each substantial interposing wall. This noise is loud enough to automatically wake you from sleep, but not loud enough to awaken nearby sleepers.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;2/hour</p>"
