As a move action while in the area of an airborne hazard, you can inhale deeply, eliminating the airborne hazard from your space as well as from a number of contiguous 5-foot cubes equal to twice the augmentation&rsquo;s model. Doing so exposes you to the hazard, though you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to any saving throw to resist initial exposure to the hazard. Upon absorbing a hazard in this way, the lungs process the material into vital energy, and you regain a number of Stamina Points equal to twice the hazard&rsquo;s CR, twice the level of the item that created the hazard, or twice the CR of the creature that created the effect. Once you inhale a hazard in this way, you cannot do so again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</span></p>"
