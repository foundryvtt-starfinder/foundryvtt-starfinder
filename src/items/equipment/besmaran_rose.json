      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Besmaran Rose </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">is an archaic, ornate compass with stylized flower petals around its circumference and a skeletal finger in place of a needle. Found in the possession of presumed Pirate Council members emerging from the Gap, these compasses have become informal badges for some councilors, with a pirate lord&rsquo;s </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Besmaran Rose </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">being passed to the next most senior </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">councillor upon the former&rsquo;s death. Among the Free Captains, losing a </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Besmaran Rose </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">is considered a terrible omen, signaling the owner&rsquo;s imminent demise. Besmara&rsquo;s faith periodically creates more of these items, yet the devices remain rare.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once per week while holding a </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Besmaran Rose</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, you can spend a full action to name an object, person, or place anywhere in the galaxy, prick your skin, and drip a drop of blood (or similar substance) onto the compass&rsquo;s needle. The device quickly absorbs the blood, turns a reddish hue, and causes the skeletal finger to whirl indecisively for a moment. The compass attempts a special check, rolling 1d20+15 with a DC based on the named subject&rsquo;s obscurity. The compass automatically succeeds in detecting a common subject, such as &ldquo;potable water&rdquo; or &ldquo;a station that can repair our starship.&rdquo; Rarer or more specific subjects are DC 20, such as &ldquo;undersea treasure&rdquo; or &ldquo;the closest starport operated by the Veskarium.&rdquo; Unique or carefully hidden subjects are typically DC 25 or higher, depending on their rarity, such as &ldquo;Rasheen&rsquo;s sunken treasure&rdquo; or a specific and covert smuggler. Some subjects, like requesting secrets about the Gap, automatically fail.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If the compass fails, it provides no benefit. If the compass succeeds, it imparts a helpful vision about the subject&rsquo;s location, such as a nearby landmark. Until the compass is activated again, it can rest atop a starship&rsquo;s or vehicle&rsquo;s controls, granting the pilot a +10 bonus to astrogate and navigate to the location. However, the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Besmaran Rose </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">only brings the user close to the objective, and additional local exploration and investigation are often necessary to uncover hidden destinations.</span></p>"
