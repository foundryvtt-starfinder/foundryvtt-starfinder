      "value": "<p>When a block of this sweet-smelling incensed is lit (a standard action), creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense&rsquo;s smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot area to a height of 20 feet over the course of 1 minute. Creatures within that area can communicate @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.gkNWZoO79HdHe0ST]{telepathically} with other creatures in the area. Creatures communicating in this fashion don&rsquo;t need to share a language, but must have an intelligence modifier of &ndash;2 or greater. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +4 insight bonus to @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.QGSqQDA9P7oYQp8z]{Diplomacy} and @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.wZkmlFdp7B8md8FO]{Sense Motive} checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a &ndash;4 penalty to @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.dQBMp7qTBkl8ku3c]{Bluff} and @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.fbvbODKQ4RxdR1ry]{Intimidate} checks against such creatures, and a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. A moderate wind (11+ mph) halves the area of the smoke. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour and is consumed in the process. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration.</p>"
