      "value": "<p>When a block of this sweet-smelling incensed is lit (a standard action), creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense&rsquo;s smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot area to a height of 20 feet over the course of 1 minute. Creatures within that area can communicate @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#telepathy]{telepathically} with other creatures in the area. Creatures communicating in this fashion don&rsquo;t need to share a language, but must have an intelligence modifier of &ndash;2 or greater. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +4 insight bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.1tzIBDaDAO4hmX5C]{Diplomacy} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.nBrYkGfNBJAHe0xJ]{Sense Motive} checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a &ndash;4 penalty to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.GcVVfpQ79HdcMqBt]{Bluff} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i]{Intimidate} checks against such creatures, and a &ndash;2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. A moderate wind (11+ mph) halves the area of the smoke. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour and is consumed in the process. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration.</p>"
