Such a punishment is rarely used anymore, but the tradition has continued in other forms. Sometimes, as part of a contract or to pay off a debt, a genie will agree to a period of servitude, binding themselves to a ring or other item and presenting it to the holder of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once per week, you can use the ring to beseech the ring&rsquo;s bonded genie for help in one of two ways. First, you may ask it a question, as the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">contact other plane </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">spell, except the genie always gives a truthful answer if it knows the answer, and no answer if it doesn&rsquo;t. Alternatively, you can request that the genie make an object for you, as the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">creation </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">spell. After you make your request, the object appears in an adjacent square. Bonded djinn and shaitan are capable of casting </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">creation </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">as a 4th-level spell in this manner, while bonded efreet and marids are capable of casting </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">creation </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">as a 5th-level spell.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, each ring gives the wearer energy resistance, shown below.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle4\"><strong>Ring of Genie Calling, Marid (Level 17):</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Cold resistance 20</span></p>"
