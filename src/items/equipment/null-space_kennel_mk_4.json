      "value": "<p>Anull-space kennelis a small device designed to be worn or strapped to clothing. This functions as anull-space chamber(Core Rulebook227), opening a circular extradimensional rift into a pocket space when activated, closing that rift when activated again, and not increasing in bulk despite the pocket space’s contents. Whereas anull-space chambercan store virtually any object, anull-space kennelis designed to house and transport a willing pet or companion creature (Alien Archive 3138), giving it enough room to relax, eat, and play in relative comfort. The maximum creature size and available air capacity of the pocket space depends on the model ofnull-space kennel. For every size category a creature is smaller than thenull-space kennel’s maximum creature size, multiply the time the item can sustain the creature by 4. Other than its creature occupant, anull-space kennelcan only store and close while containing items of a combinedbulk that doesn’t exceed the device’s item level. While the device’s rift is open, the creature can leave freely, and the rift closes once it exits.</p>\n<p>When you purchase anull-space kennel, you can customize its interior, such as having it be a saltwater pool, woodland clearing, or indoor space. These features are entirely contained within the pocket space, even if you attempt to pour out the device’s contents. If you store UPBs in anull-space kennel, the device consumes a number of UPBs per day equal to twice its item level, using these to fabricate food and a variety of engaging toys for the creature inside. By spending 8 hours reconfiguring the device and expending UPBs worth 10% the device’s cost, you can change the interior features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> The device can house a Medium creature with enough air for 24 hours.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 7):</strong> The device can house a Large creature with enough air for 24 hours.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 11):</strong> The device can house a Huge creature with enough air for 24 hours.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 4 (Level 15):</strong> The device can house a Huge creature with enough air for a week.</li>\n</ul>"
