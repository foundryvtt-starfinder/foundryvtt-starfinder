Usually, party wear takes the form of special costumes or unusual dress that one must wear to avoid looking out of place at the engagement. Lacking the proper party wear at a social event can cause you to take a penalty of up to &ndash;4 to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks at the function, as determined by the GM.</strong></p>"
