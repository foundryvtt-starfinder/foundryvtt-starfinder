When it is placed near your ear (or a similar orifice), it animates and enters your body. Once inside you, the runeworm intertwines with your internal anatomy and releases an arcane virus that rewrites and improves some part of your body’s function. It functions as a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.ekB4Bk9517BmoGr4]{mk 2 synergizing symbiote}, which is able to increase an ability score by 4. However, it is so advanced that it can instead upgrade any mk 2 personal upgrade already in your system to a mk 3 personal upgrade, increasing the ability score bonus from +4 to +6.</p>\n<p><em>If only using the Runeworm's base function, change and enable your selected Ability upgrade in the Modifiers tab.</em></p>"
