      "value": "<p>This emergency hovercraft is more luxurious and capable than its basic counterpart, and it is 2 feet wide and 4 feet long in its compact form. When activated, it unfolds into a hover pod, except that it has 40 Hit Points, is broken when reduced to or below 20 Hit Points, provides no bonus to Piloting checks, and has no autocontrol system. As a move action, you can return the hovercraft to its portable shape at the touch of a button, as long as no objects or creatures remain inside. An emergency hovercraft consumes 2 charges when you activate or collapse it, and it consumes 1 charge for every 10 minutes (or fraction thereof) its engines are in operation. You can power down its engines so that it doesn&rsquo;t consume charges; like a basic emergency raft, it comes with four oars for rowing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>Varies</p>",
