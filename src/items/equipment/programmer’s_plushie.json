Each plushie houses a limited virtual intelligence that can analyze its owner’s code and basic biosigns, using this data to provide simple pointers or reassuring cheerleading as necessary. It also encrypts and stores password information with retinal scanning tech that allows it to recognize its owner. While your programmer’s plushie is adjacent to you and activated, reduce any total penalty to Computers checks by 1.</p>"
