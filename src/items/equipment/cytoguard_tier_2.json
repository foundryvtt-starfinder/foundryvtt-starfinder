      "value": "<h2>Deep Indigo Extract</h2>\n<p>Scientists who survived early encounters with enigmas took samples of the sparkling, rainbow-hued organic matter&mdash;nicknamed deep indigo&mdash; that threatened osiferns expel. This material has inspired numerous medical developments, especially ones that harness osiferns&rsquo; regenerative properties. While osifern sprouts contain the same chemicals needed to produce these medicinal extracts, they yield such small quantities that harvesting enough to create even a single dose has proven inefficient, though not impossible. Deep indigo extract follows the rules for medicinals presented on pages 231&ndash;232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook; two examples are described below.</p>\n<h3>Cytoguard</h3>\n<p>Similar to an antitoxin, cytoguard actively regenerates cellular damage, mitigating the immediate effects of poison. When you take or are injected with cytoguard, you gain resistance equal to 3 times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to the damage dealt by initial exposure to poison. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier to saving throws against poison. Both effects last for a number of hours equal to the medicinal&rsquo;s tier.</p>\n<h3>Prismatilate</h3>\n<p>A prismatilate extract releases a steady dose of endorphins and regenerative agents that encourage long-term recovery. When you take or are injected with prismatilate, you gain a bonus (equal to 2 + the medicinal&rsquo;s tier) to saving throws to remove negative levels. In addition, you increase the number of HP you recover from a full night&rsquo;s rest or complete bed rest by 25% times the medicinal&rsquo;s tier. Both effects last for 24 hours.</p>",
