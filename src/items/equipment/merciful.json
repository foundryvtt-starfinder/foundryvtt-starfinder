The magic of this fusion subdues the damaging effect of the weapon it is added to. While this fusion is active, the weaponâ€™s regular damage becomes nonlethal damage. If the weapon deals two types of damage, both of the damage types become nonlethal. You can activate or deactivate the <em>merciful</em> fusion as a swift action.</p>"
