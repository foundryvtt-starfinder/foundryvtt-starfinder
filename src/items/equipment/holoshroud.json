      "value": "<p>This loose mesh of wire and miniature holographic projectors is used to disguise the presence of creatures or objects. Holoshroud comes in 10-foot-by-10-foot square sheets. When you hide under an activated holoshroud, you gain a +2 insight bonus to Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. Covering yourself with holoshroud is a full action requiring a successful DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the holoshroud and do not gain its bonus to Stealth checks). You have the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition when using a holoshroud, except you do not take a penalty to initiative or Stealth checks from this condition. Taking off a holoshroud is a move action, or you can take off the holoshroud as part of the move action to stand up from a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone} position. A creature with the blindsense ability ignores the effect of a holoshroud. You cannot hide under a holoshroud that is not activated; if the holoshroud runs out of charges while you are underneath it, you are visible as normal.</p>\n<p>You can spend 1 minute covering a Medium or smaller object with a holoshroud, making it appear to be a natural part of the surrounding terrain. For example, you can conceal a hoverbike as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two holoshrouds. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five holoshrouds and takes 10 minutes of work. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 holoshrouds and takes 1 hour of work. The DC of Perception checks to notice or search for an object covered by a holoshroud is increased by 10. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by holoshrouds automatically recognizes it as a camouflaged object.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;1/hour</p>"
