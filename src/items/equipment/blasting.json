This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon’s normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don’t have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the <em>blasting </em>fusion. Weapons that don’t require attack rolls to affect their targets also can’t benefit from the <em>blasting </em>fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
