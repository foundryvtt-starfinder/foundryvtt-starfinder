As a standard action, you can create an illusion that functions as holographic image with a spell level equal to the model number of your holographic eyes at any location you can see within range. You must concentrate on the illusion as a move action to maintain it, and you must keep your eyes on the illusion to concentrate, treating all other creatures as if they had concealment. Casting a spell (including creating a new illusion with your holographic eyes) immediately ends your concentration. The effectâ€™s caster level is equal to your level, and the Will save DC to disbelieve it is equal to 10 + half your level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.kDFNOMx78KU1GGol]{Holographic Image}</p>"
