When created, each&nbsp;<em>polymorphic serum</em>&nbsp;is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a&nbsp;<em>polymorph</em>&nbsp;spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this polymorph form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a&nbsp;<em>polymorphic serum&nbsp;</em> changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a&nbsp;<em>polymorphic serum</em>&nbsp;(such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the&nbsp;<em>polymorph</em>&nbsp;spell.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.gNgdSyi4pXQmasmc]{Polymorph}</p>\n<h2>Serums</h2>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
