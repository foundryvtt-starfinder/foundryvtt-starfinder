A gunner harness reduces the minimum Strength score required to fire a heavy weapon without penalty, as determined by the harness’s type. In addition, when you fire the mounted weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range by a value determined by the harness’s type. Donning or removing a gunner harness is a full action, and attaching a weapon to a gunner harness or removing it is a full action.</p>\n<p>Strength 14; reduce your total penalty by 2.</p>"
