      "value": "<p>Crafted of chemicals found on sweltering jungle worlds, this dull-brown cylindrical unit is no larger than a datapad. When an evenfire unit is activated, an electric current causes the chemicals to emit steady heat, but not light, within a 30-foot radius. Over 1 minute, the temperature of this area increases by 60° F, to a maximum of 80° F. The effects of multiple active evenfire units do not stack. This heat dissipates once the unit is shut off. An evenfire’s heat is consistent throughout the area and is no hotter closer to the unit than at the edge of its area of effect. Anyone in the heated area gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers. In moderate or strong winds, an evenfire’s temperature increase is reduced to 30° F, and the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves is reduced to +1.</p>\n<p>In severe or stronger winds, an evenfire unit provides no temperature increase or save bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 2/hour</p>"
