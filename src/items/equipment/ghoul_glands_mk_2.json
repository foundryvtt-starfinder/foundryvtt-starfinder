The glands produce their own loathsome chemicals, but they also pull energy from your body and mind and use it to create a staggering or paralyzing effect on foes. As a standard action a number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark, you can activate the glands and attempt to touch a foe (doing so requires a successful melee attack roll against the target’s KAC). The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered (for mk 1 through mk 3 ghoul glands) or stunned (for mk 4 and mk 5 ghoul glands) for 1d4 rounds.</p>"
