One end of eachphaserodends in a blunted point, and the other end has a small loop large enough to thread through a rope or cable line. When the pointed end is held against a solid surface and activated as a move action, up to half of thephaserodbecomes insubstantial, can easily be driven into the surface, and then becomes solid once more an instant later, creating a firm anchor point for climbing or hauling. Thephaserodcan be activated and extracted as a move action. Alternatively, while holding at least twophaserods, you can activate, anchor, and deactivate the items in quick succession, granting you a +8 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to climb a surface. An anchoredphaserodcan be torn free with a successful DC 23 Strength check.</p>"
