For 1 round after you successfully attack a single creature with your weapon, it is surrounded by a pale glow that reveals its location. While so illuminated, the creature takes a &ndash;20 penalty to Stealth checks and does not benefit from concealment provided by darkness, <em>invisibility</em>, smoke, and similar effects. However, <em>displacement</em> and other effects that shift location entirely are not negated. The light is too dim to harm creatures vulnerable to light and does not serve to illuminate anything but the creature affected by limning. <em>Limning</em> weapons create glows in a variety of hues, and some even bestow a variety of colors. The <em>limning</em> fusion has no effect on attacks that affect multiple foes.</span></p>"
