      "value": "<p>This canister of quick-dry spray-on polymer provides protection for anyone handling dangerous materials but can&rsquo;t afford to have their fine motor control impeded by gloves. Applying the polymer to your arms and hands takes a full action, and the polymer lasts for 1 hour before flaking away. While coated, you gain resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire damage, as well as immunity to contact poisons, drugs, and other toxins. The polymer protects you in this way only from objects you&rsquo;re handling&mdash;such as scooping up lava, handling toxic chemicals, or manipulating high-voltage wires&mdash;but not from other attacks or effects. One canister holds enough liquid polymer for 10 applications.</p>"
