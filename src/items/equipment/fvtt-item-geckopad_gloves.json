      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTechItems_ctl00_LabelName\">These subtle yet stylish black gloves have fingers tipped in a complex microscopic texture that mimics the setae of a gecko&rsquo;s foot pads, allowing you to adhere to most small objects with ease. When you wear a pair of geckopad gloves, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to palm an object, and you reduce the DC of Sleight of Hand checks to pick pockets by 5.<br />You must be wearing both gloves to gain their benefits, but they don&rsquo;t prevent you from holding other objects or wielding weapons with those hands. Geckopad gloves don&rsquo;t require a battery to function.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
