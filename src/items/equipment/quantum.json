One of these is the quantum weapon fusion, which causes a ranged weapon to appear to constantly shimmer and jump between two slightly different states.</p>\n<p>Still, there is yet much to learn about perfecting the technology, and several corporations are investing heavily in research and development with an aim toward applying the innovation to melee weapons&mdash;though this has thus far proven too unstable and dangerous for the user.</p>\n<h3>QUANTUM FUSION</h3>\n<p>Three times per day as a standard action, you can use a quantum weapon to make two ranged attacks, each against a different target. After learning the result of each attack, you must pick one attack to ignore (it doesn&rsquo;t hit or expend ammunition and has no effects) and apply the effects of the other attack (such as damage and critical hit effects) as normal. This fusion can be applied only to ranged weapons.</p>"
