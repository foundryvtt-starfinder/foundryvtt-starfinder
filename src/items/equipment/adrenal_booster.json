When you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4MxAK5uS0zMNWhUK]{Dying}, the number of Resolve Points you need to stabilize is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1 Resolve Point needed to stabilize). This ability doesnâ€™t stack with any other ability that allows you to spend fewer Resolve Points to stabilize. In addition, once per day, you can spend the required Resolve Points to stabilize and 1 additional Resolve Point to stay in the fight (regaining 1 Hit Point) in the same round.</p>"
