When you take a move action to aim a weapon with this fusion at a specific target, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll with that weapon provided neither you nor your target has moved since you aimed. You also gain this bonus if you take a move action to aim for other purposes, such as aiming a weapon with the sniper special property. Only ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.</span></p>",
