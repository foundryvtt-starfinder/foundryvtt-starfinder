Ascending into the air is similar to walking up an incline. The maximum upward angle possible is 45 degrees, and you move at a rate equal to half your normal land speed. You can move your full land speed horizontally or up to 45 degrees downward. Unless you have mk 2 force soles, you must end your movement on the ground or you fall.</p>"
