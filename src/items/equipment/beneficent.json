As long as you are wielding the same weapon, you can expend a charge of beneficence to cast either <em>remove affliction</em> or <em>lesser remove condition</em> as a spell-like ability, using the weapon’s item level as your caster level. You cannot have more than one charge of beneficence at a time, and you lose all charges of beneficence if you take a 10 minute rest and spend a Resolve Point to regain your Stamina Points or if you take an 8-hour rest and regain your daily-use abilities and spells. If the weapon with the <em>beneficent</em> fusion has an item level of 14 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast <em>remove condition</em>. If the weapon has an item level of 19 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast <em>greater remove condition</em>. A weapon cannot have the <em>beneficent</em> weapon fusion if it also has the <em>unholy</em> or <em>wounding</em> weapon fusions.</p>"
