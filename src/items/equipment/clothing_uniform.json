Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Uniforms are clothes worn by members of a specific group. They come in a wide variety of styles, each unique to the group or organization that uses them. Examples include uniforms for corporate employees, emergency-service workers, health-care practitioners, maintenance workers, military or security personnel, prisoners, public-transit employees, students, and more. Wearing the proper uniform grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a member of the group that the uniform represents. Some uniforms, especially for government-funded organizations such as the military or security forces, are tightly controlled and may not be available for purchase by non-members (or cost considerably more on the black market).</strong></p>"
