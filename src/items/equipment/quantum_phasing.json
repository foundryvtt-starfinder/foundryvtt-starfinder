      "value": "<p>This armor upgrade allows you to rapidly and randomly transition in and out of rel-state. You can activate the upgrade as a swift action; when it is activated, attacks against you have a 50% miss chance. During this time, you are flickering in and out of existence, so the Blind-Fight feat, blindsense ability, and true seeing spell don&rsquo;t help opponents locate you. While this upgrade is active, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. If you end your turn inside a solid object, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet traveled. These benefits last until you take another swift action to deactivate the upgrade or it runs out of charges. A quantum phasing upgrade&rsquo;s charges replenish each day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
