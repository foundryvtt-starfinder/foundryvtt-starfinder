      "value": "<p>This armor upgrade allows you to rapidly and randomly transition in and out of rel-state. You can activate the upgrade as a swift action; when it is activated, attacks against you have a 50% miss chance. During this time, you are flickering in and out of existence, so the Blind-Fight feat, blindsense ability, and true seeing spell don’t help opponents locate you. While this upgrade is active, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. If you end your turn inside a solid object, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet traveled. These benefits last until you take another swift action to deactivate the upgrade or it runs out of charges. A quantum phasing upgrade’s charges replenish each day.</p>"
