You must be standing on the ground when you activate the time-pit boots, and you can’t activate them in zero-g. Upon activating the boots, a rift in the fabric of time opens beneath your feet and sucks you in. The rift closes immediately behind you, and you can’t take any other creatures with you. You cease to exist for 1d4 rounds as you fall though time; you are undetectable and can’t be affected by any creature. You can’t take actions during this time, as it passes instantaneously for you. You’re then expelled through a momentary rift that appears above the space you occupied when you activated the boots (or the nearest random open space, if your original space is now occupied). You’re treated as having fallen 50 feet for every round you were gone, although if you can fly or otherwise mitigate the falling damage, you land uninjured.</p>\n<p>Time-pit boots can’t be recharged normally. When worn by a creature under a haste effect countered by slow, or under a slow effect countered by haste, the boots latch onto the slight temporal displacement to begin recharging. They can’t be used for 24 hours, but recover all their charges at the end of that period.</p>"
