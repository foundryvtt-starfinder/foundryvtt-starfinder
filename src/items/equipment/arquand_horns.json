While you wear Arquand horns, you receive a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against fear effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can command the Arquand horns to protect you with an aura that lasts for 1 minute. While the aura lasts, creatures within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to attack you, cast a spell that includes you as an unwilling target, or take any action to directly harm or disable your equipment. This is a mindaffecting, emotion effect, and a creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the aura for 24 hours. Arquand gazelles are immune to the aura. A set of Arquand horns can create this effect once per day, and after you have used one set of Arquand horns to create this effect, you can’t do so again with any other set for 24 hours.</p>"
