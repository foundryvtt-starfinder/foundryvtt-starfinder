While you wear Arquand horns, you receive a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against fear effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can command the Arquand horns to protect you with an aura that lasts for 1 minute. While the aura lasts, creatures within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to attack you, cast a spell that includes you as an unwilling target, or take any action to directly harm or disable your equipment. This is a mindaffecting, emotion effect, and a creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the aura for 24 hours. Arquand gazelles are immune to the aura. A set of Arquand horns can create this effect once per day, and after you have used one set of Arquand horns to create this effect, you can&rsquo;t do so again with any other set for 24 hours.</p>"
