      "value": "<p>A wrist leech is a dark red, sluglike life-form about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch in thickness; one end of the creature ends in a circular sucker with tiny teeth. The leech can be applied to an individual&rsquo;s skin, whereupon it attaches and begins sucking the individual&rsquo;s bodily fluids. The wrist leech&rsquo;s carefully designed physiology then filters the blood, removing toxins and other harmful chemicals from the bloodstream before returning it to the host&rsquo;s body. An individual with an attached wrist leech gains a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against any injury affliction. A wrist leech requires no battery, but survives for only 4 hours once placed on the skin before it shrivels up and dies.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>",
