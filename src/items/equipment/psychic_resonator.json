      "value": "<p>A&nbsp;psychic resonator&nbsp;amplifies telepathy, allowing long-distance telepathic communication. The resonator doubles the range of limited telepathy and telepathy, affecting creatures on a planetary scale. If you have limited telepathy or telepathy, you can operate the&nbsp;psychic resonator&nbsp;as if it were a comm unit with a system-wide range to send a message to a creature you know. Otherwise, the resonator can send a telepathic broadcast at a much shorter range, such as from the depths of a star to that star&rsquo;s surface. In any case, if your telepathy is @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Language-dependent}, you must still share a language with your target for that target to understand the message. In addition, sources of psychic interference can hamper or block messages sent through a&nbsp;psychic resonator, changing the message&rsquo;s content, feeling, or both, as well as making the results affect only certain creatures.</p>"
