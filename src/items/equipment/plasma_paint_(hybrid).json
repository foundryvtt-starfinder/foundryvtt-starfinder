Grinding down these parts and combining them with specially formulated chemicals creates a protective paint for coating armor or shock-sensitive electronics. Plasma paint doesn&rsquo;t need to coat the entire surface of the armor it&rsquo;s being applied to, and plasma paint enthusiasts, such as celebrity performers, often commission protective suits painted with stunningly decorative designs.</p>\n<p>Your armor&rsquo;s painted patterns channel incoming energy, either dissipating it entirely or directing it into your weapons. You gain electricity resistance 5. When you take 5 or more electricity damage from a single attack or effect (before applying your resistance), you glow in a 10-foot radius (increasing the light level by one step, up to normal light) until the end of your next turn. During this time, any electricity damage you deal with non-analog weapons before the end of your next turn increases by 1d6.</p>"
