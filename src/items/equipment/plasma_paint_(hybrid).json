Grinding down these parts and combining them with specially formulated chemicals creates a protective paint for coating armor or shock-sensitive electronics. Plasma paint doesn’t need to coat the entire surface of the armor it’s being applied to, and plasma paint enthusiasts, such as celebrity performers, often commission protective suits painted with stunningly decorative designs.</p>\n<p>Your armor’s painted patterns channel incoming energy, either dissipating it entirely or directing it into your weapons. You gain electricity resistance 5. When you take 5 or more electricity damage from a single attack or effect (before applying your resistance), you glow in a 10-foot radius (increasing the light level by one step, up to normal light) until the end of your next turn. During this time, any electricity damage you deal with non-analog weapons before the end of your next turn increases by 1d6.</p>"
