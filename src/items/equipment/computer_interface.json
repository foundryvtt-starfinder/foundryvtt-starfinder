      "value": "<p>Your armor is wired to allow an integrated onboard computer to monitor your condition and operate some functions of your armor. An armor interface comes with a tier 1 computer with an artificial personality and a single control module linked to your armor. You can access this computer without exposing it or yourself to the environment outside of your armor, and you receive information from it through heads-up displays and broadcasts via your armor’s integrated comm unit.<br>With a successful Computers check (DC = the DC needed to hack the computer) you can set the computer to give basic information about your condition (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and so on) to authorized users (which you designate), or to anyone with a medkit, advanced medkit, or medical lab. Characters who can access this information gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks they attempt on you.<br>With 10 minutes of work, you can set the computer’s control module to operate any one system in your armor, as long as that system doesn’t take a full action or longer to activate or deactivate. Common applications are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} or a force field armor upgrade. You can set the computer to operate the upgrade at your command (allowing you to activate one such item each round without taking an action to do so), or set it to automatically trigger the system under specific conditions as follows: the first time you take damage, the first time you take Hit Point damage, when you are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned}, when you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{Staggered}, when you are unconscious, or when the atmospheric conditions change. If the trigger occurs, the computer automatically activates the linked system. This occurs at the end of your next turn after the condition occurs. The control module can be linked to weapons or tools that are part of the armor, subject to the normal limitations of control modules (Core Rulebook 215).<br>You can install a higher-tier computer into the computer interface, as long as it has light or negligible bulk. You must pay for the additional computer separately, and installing it requires a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the DC to hack the new computer. The computer cannot have countermeasures that require links to the environment beyond the armor (such as a shock grid) or control modules that control anything other than armor systems, and it cannot activate more than one system each round (even if linked to multiple systems with automatic triggers).</p>",
