      "value": "<p>This smooth, thumb-sized device activates automatically when it is inside a living creature. You can implant a diagnostic lozenge subdermally in a willing or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} creature with a successful DC 20 Medicine check, or a creature can choose to swallow one. An activated diagnostic lozenge steers itself into a creature&rsquo;s tissue and extrudes several filaments to monitor its status, broadcasting information on a predetermined wireless frequency to a designated receiver, such as a datapad or comm unit, as long as the receiver is within 1 mile of the lozenge. The diagnostic lozenge broadcasts the creature&rsquo;s direction and distance relative to the receiver, as well as any of the following conditions that are affecting the creature: @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4MxAK5uS0zMNWhUK]{Dying}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.DtwiUWi8dpzkq4tM]{Frightened}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{Nauseated}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.BVdjvpucmvQU4cc1]{Panicked}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{Sickened}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.H51jmhxF9XuwDOE7]{Stable}, staggered, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}. A single receiver can accept information from up to six different diagnostic lozenges simultaneously. When a diagnostic lozenge runs out of charges, it breaks down into harmless components that eventually pass out of the creature&rsquo;s body. Diagnostic lozenges can&rsquo;t normally be safely removed once activated.</p>",
