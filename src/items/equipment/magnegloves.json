These magnets can be activated as a move action, providing you a +2 insight bonus to Athletics checks to climb metal surfaces, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against attempts to disarm you (per the disarm combat maneuver) of metal items that youâ€™re holding, consuming 1 charge every hour.</p>\n<p>As a move action while you are grappling a creature, you can cause the magnegloves to draw together more powerfully, increasing the DC of the Acrobatics check to escape your grapple or pin by 2, or by 5 if the creature is wearing metal armor, carrying a significant amount of metal, or made of metal. You can unbind the magnegloves as a swift action. While set to draw together, the magnegloves consume 1 charge each round.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> Varies</p>"
