You can pilot the suit of powered armor that has the upgrade, activating the upgrade as a move action to move the linked armor up to its land speed. You can instead take a full action to activate the linked armor and have it automatically follow the remote at a selected distance from 5 to 500 feet. The linked powered armor can otherwise take no actions or carry any objects or creatures. If the linked armor is ever more than 500 feet from the remote, it immediately stops in place and must be reactivated to be used again.</p>"
