The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save; otherwise, it can&rsquo;t use its limited telepathy or telepathy for 1d4 rounds. If the creature has the hive mind or Swarm mind ability, it can&rsquo;t use that ability and gains the flat-footed and off-target conditions for the same duration. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the <em>hive buster</em> effect.</span></p>",
