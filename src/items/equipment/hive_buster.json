The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save; otherwise, it can’t use its limited telepathy or telepathy for 1d4 rounds. If the creature has the hive mind or Swarm mind ability, it can’t use that ability and gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} conditions for the same duration. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the <em>hive buster</em> effect.</p>"
