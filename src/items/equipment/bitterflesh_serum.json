In addition, for the first 10 minutes, your body becomes universally foul-tasting, causing any creature that damages you with a bite or tongue attack to become sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your Constitution modifier).</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Serums</h2>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
