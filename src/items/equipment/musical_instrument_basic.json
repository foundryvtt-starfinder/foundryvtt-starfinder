All but the most traditional and classical instruments use modern technology to amplify their sound, provide musical accompaniment, or connect wirelessly to other instruments in a band or orchestra.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basic musical instruments can vary widely in quality and dimensions, but all can be played to provide a +2 insight bonus to Profession (musician) checks to earn a living. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, this bonus might also apply to similar Profession skills.
