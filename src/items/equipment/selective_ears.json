When you activate your selective ears as a reaction, you can’t take a move action on your next turn. Selective ears have three modes: inactive, muffling, and silence. Your selective ears remain in their current mode until you change them. While your selective ears are in muffling mode, you take a –2 penalty to initiative checks and hearing-based Perception checks, but you can’t be deafened for more than 1 round by sonic effects and you have sonic resistance 1. While your selective ears are in silence mode, you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.D8JvCEmOiWKe2UDx]{deafened} and thus immune to sound-based sensedependent effects, and you also have sonic resistance 5.</p>\n<p><em>Enable/Disable sonic resistance in the Modifiers tab.</em></p>"
