The specific effect depends on the purpose for which the seed was bioengineered.&nbsp;Vital seeds&nbsp;can grow livestock and plants, replace missing organs, and perform many other useful tasks. Some common vital seeds are listed here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>As a standard action, you can squeeze a&nbsp;beast vital seed&nbsp;and place it on the ground or throw it (range 20 feet). A Medium First World beast grows from the seed instantaneously as if you had just completed casting the 3rd-level version of the&nbsp;summon creature&nbsp;spell. Rather than obeying your commands, the creature is initially friendly toward you.</strong></h4>"
