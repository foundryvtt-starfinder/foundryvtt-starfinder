Drinking a spellcaster’s serum fills you with additional magical energy that you can use to enhance the next spell you cast. This energy lasts until the end of your next turn. If you don’t cast a spell in this time, this magical energy is wasted with no effect. A spell can be modified by only one spellcaster’s serum at a time and each spellcaster’s serum can modify only one spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Reaching (Level 5; 480 credits)</strong>: A reaching spellcaster’s serum is red. The first time you cast a spell while this serum is in effect, you extend its range. If the spell has a range of close, the spell’s range is increased by 5 additional feet. If the spell has a range of medium, the range is increased by 10 additional feet. If the spell has a range of long, the range is increased by 40 additional feet. If the spell does not have one of these ranges, the spell is unaffected by the effects of this serum. If the spell affects an area, this increase to its range doesn’t alter the size of its area.</p>"
