It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a move action, you can create a double (as mirror image) that lasts until you spend another move action to deactivate the device or it runs out of charges. No more than one double can be active at the same time. A holodouble moduleâ€™s charges replenish each day.</p>\n<p>This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor</p>"
