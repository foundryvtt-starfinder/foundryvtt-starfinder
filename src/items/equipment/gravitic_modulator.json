While a selamid simply absorbs the device into its protoplasm, most humanoids wear the&nbsp;gravitic modulator&nbsp;as a backpack due to its size and weight.</p>\n<p>While wearing a&nbsp;gravitic modulator, you are shielded from some of the effects of rapidly changing gravity. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws to resist gravity-based effects, such as a&nbsp;control gravity&nbsp;spell or a solarian’s black hole revelation. In addition, whenever you would take damage from extreme gravity, you take 5 less damage (minimum 0 damage).</p>"
