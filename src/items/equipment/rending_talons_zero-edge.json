      "value": "<p><strong>Damage </strong>8d6 S</p>\n<p>These augmentations can take the form of retractable claws installed directly into your feet, or prosthetic feet that replace your own and sport powerfully clawed toes. In either case, the rending talons provide you excellent grip and provide a deadly advantage against anyone you grab. You ignore any increase to the DCs of Acrobatics checks to balance and Athletics checks to climb due to slipperiness or iciness.<br />When you renew a grapple, as a swift action before the end of your turn you can use your talons to rake your target. Your talons function as a basic melee weapon with the analog weapon special property for this purpose, and they deal damage based on their model. The talons can only be deployed properly as weapons when grappling a target or damaging a helpless target, and thus can&rsquo;t be used to make other attacks.</p>"
