      "value": "<p>A personal phase shifter works on a subatomic level to allow atoms to pass out of phase with one another. In practice, this allows the affected material to exist without interacting with other physical material. A personal phase shifter is a formfitting jumpsuit that can be worn over most clothing and light armor, but not over heavy armor or powered armor. When you activate a personal phase shifter, you are incorporeal (Core Rulebook 264) except you do not gain the ability to move at full speed if you otherwise could not do so. The phase shifter contains antigravity repulsors that grant you a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. You cannot hold any items while incorporeal, and your nonmagical attacks deal half damage. Magical attacks are unaffected, and you can use magic items and other equipment worn under the jumpsuit as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>100;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>10/round</p>"
