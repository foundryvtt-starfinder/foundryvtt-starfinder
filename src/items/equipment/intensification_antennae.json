      "value": "<p>These supplemental antennae take a variety of forms, tailored to your species and style, such as foot-long antennae that emerge from your temples or manes of sensory whiskers surrounding the ears. Intensification antennae augment your sensory abilities. If you have blindsense or blindsight, this augmentation extends the range of that sense by 30 feet (maximum twice the sense&rsquo;s base range). If you have both blindsense and blindsight based on the same sense, such as blindsense (vibration) and blindsight (vibration), this augmentation affects both. However, if you have multiple forms of blindsense or blindsight based on different senses, such as one based on vibration and another on scent, you must choose one of the senses for the antennae to enhance when you acquire the augmentation.</p>"
