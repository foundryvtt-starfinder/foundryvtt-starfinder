This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the <em>malediction</em> fusion if it also has either the <em>holy</em> or <em>merciful</em> weapon fusions.&nbsp;</span></p>",
