      "value": "<h1>Animistic Tools</h1>\n<p>People often have superstitions regarding whether objects have a spirit or intelligence, and animistic tools were made with such beliefs in mind. Each of these tool kits has the power to communicate a user&rsquo;s intentions to inanimate objects. When you use&nbsp;animistic tools&nbsp;with the appropriate skill and you fail a check, you can use the tool&rsquo;s magic to reroll the check and take the higher result. In addition, as a move action, you can tap or bang a tool from the kit on a broken object, causing the object to ignore the penalties of being broken for a time. An item can benefit from&nbsp;animistic tools&nbsp;in this way only once per day, causing some engineers to joke that no one likes percussive maintenance.<br /><br />The model of the tools determines the number of rerolls per day and the time an item ignores the broken condition. Once you use a set of animistic tools, you can&rsquo;t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Two rerolls; ignore the broken condition for 10 minutes</strong></p>"
