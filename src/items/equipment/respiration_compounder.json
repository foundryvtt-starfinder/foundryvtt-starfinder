Treat your Constitution score as though it were doubled for the purpose of how long you can hold your breath. You also gain a +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue holding your breath. This doesn’t protect you from other dangers of an airless environment.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListCybernetics_ctl00_LabelName\">The compounder also filters your air, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons or other airborne toxins.</span></p>",
