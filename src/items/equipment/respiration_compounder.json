Treat your Constitution score as though it were doubled for the purpose of how long you can hold your breath. You also gain a +4 bonus to Constitution checks to continue holding your breath. This doesnâ€™t protect you from other dangers of an airless environment.</p>\n<p>The compounder also filters your air, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws against inhaled @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} or other airborne toxins.</p>"
