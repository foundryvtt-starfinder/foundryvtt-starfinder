      "value": "<p>A gray comm unit, a bizarre device made of smoky crystal and wires of gold and silver, functions like a normal comm unit, except it sends only telepathic signals. You must identify the receiver, who must also have a gray comm unit, which notifies the receiver of an incoming message. To send or receive the message, you must have limited telepathy or telepathy, or you must cast mindlink (an exception to that spellâ€™s normal targeting) or telepathy targeting the gray comm unit. Either spell retains its other parameters, such as duration. A mystic using the mindlink class feature can target a gray comm unit with the spell any number of times per day, even if the message comes from or goes to the same creature. Three kinds of gray comm unit units see use.</p>\n<p>This bulky handheld unit can reach another unit on the same planet or on an object orbiting the same planet.</p>"
