A user operating the receiving computer can affect the computer to which the transponder is attached without being physically present at that computer. Because the&nbsp;astral transponder&nbsp;transmits its signal through another plane, normal shielding, signal jammers, and similar countermeasures have no effect on the transmission. An&nbsp;astral transponder&nbsp;can be attuned to a new receiving computer with 1 minute of work and a successful DC 22 Computers or Mysticism check.</p>"
