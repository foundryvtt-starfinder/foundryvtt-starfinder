The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only <em>true seeing</em> or similar magic reveals the true nature of a <em>glamered </em>weapon while it is in disguise. After a <em>glamered</em> weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.&nbsp;</span></p>",
