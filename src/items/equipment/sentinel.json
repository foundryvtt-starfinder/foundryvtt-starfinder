      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Like most weapon fusions designed for use on AbadarCorp weapons, the <em>sentinel</em> fusion makes a weapon richly ornamented, sometimes even gold-plated, and often adds icons of vault doors. Favored by colonists and corporate guards, once per day a <em>sentinel</em> weapon allows you to declare an area of up to 1,000 cubic feet as being under guard for up to 8 continuous hours. While wielding the <em>sentinel</em> weapon within an area under guard in this manner, you gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks and Perception checks.&nbsp;</span></p>",
