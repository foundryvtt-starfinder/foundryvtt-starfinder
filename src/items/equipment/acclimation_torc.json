      "value": "<p>This simple metal band attaches to the collar area of your space suit, suit of armor, or other set of clothes. When activated as a standard action, an acclimation torc places your respiratory system and your digestive system in a form of temporal stasis, while still keeping you alive. Essentially, your need to eat, drink, and breathe is temporarily “paused” while the acclimation torc continues to hold a charge. You can breathe normally in vacuums, clouds of smoke, water, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres, though you aren’t protected against the damage of a corrosive atmosphere. In addition, you don’t need to worry about starvation or thirst while your acclimation torc is active. Unlike the normal protections provided by most suits of armor, an acclimation torc doesn’t grant you protection against low levels of radiation or conditions of cold and heat. An acclimation torc holds 50 charges and uses 1 charge per hour. You can replenish these charges the same way you recharge the duration of a suit of armor’s @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} (Starfinder Core Rulebook&nbsp;198).</p>\n<h2>Relic</h2>\n<p>These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the item’s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p>"
