      "value": "<p>Beacon buoys are tiny, specialized flotation devices, each of which can self-adjust to float in place in water of any density. You can deploy a single beacon buoy as a move action, and each is automatically paired with a simple application that can be installed on most comm units and datapads. To deploy a buoy so that its data proves useful, it must have sufficient space by being at least 1 mile from any other buoy you’ve deployed. When you have at least 2 buoys deployed with sufficient space, you can use their relational-data feed to give you a circumstance bonus to Piloting checks to navigate in a vehicle and to Survival checks to orienteer underwater. This bonus is equal to half the number of buoys you’ve deployed with sufficient space (to a maximum of +10).</p>"
