They also pass into the Ethereal Plane, allowing such attacks to affect ethereal creatures normally. Weapons with the <em>ghost killer</em> fusion can also score critical hits against incorporeal creatures. In addition, an incorporeal creature (though not an ethereal one) can pick up, move, or wield a <em>ghost killer</em> weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>",
