These enlightened medicinals follow the rules for medicinals on pages 231–232 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook, though they’re hybrid items that use Life Science or Mysticism as the associated skills for crafting.</p>\n<h3>Revitilate</h3>\n<p>A revitilate contains a spark of Nirvana’s vitality that activates when it senses death is near. A revitilate you take or are injected with provides no immediate benefit but remains in your system for a number of hours equal to the medicinal’s tier. The first time you would spend Resolve Points to stabilize, you can subtract the medicinal’s tier from your maximum RP total when determining how many RP you must spend. The first time you spend 1 RP to stay in the fight after using the medicinal, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 1d8 times the medicinal’s tier. Once the medicinal provides both benefits, its effects end.</p>"
