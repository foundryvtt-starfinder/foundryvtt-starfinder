The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use&nbsp;entropic grasp&nbsp;as a spell-like ability (save DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier; caster level 9th). If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of&nbsp;entropy gloves, you can&rsquo;t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>"
