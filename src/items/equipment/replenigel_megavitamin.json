      "value": "<p>Replenigel is a nutritional gelatin interwoven with nanites that bolster the immune system. Originally designed by Abadarcorp during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, replenigel is intended to provide a soldier with all of their daily nutritional needs and an added resistance to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions}, while digesting slowly enough to require a soldier to eat only once per day. To minimize packaging costs, Abadarcorp commonly shipped replenigel to the front lines in 50-pound blocks that, unappetizingly, resembled marbled sulfur. After the conflict with the Veskarium ceased, the corporation found itself with a surplus of replenigel cubes and no way to sell them. A particularly savvy marketing executive realized that subtle tweaks to the product’s aesthetics could have a dramatic impact on its commercial viability. After extensive focus-group testing, Abadarcorp created Nutrimanders, reshaping the gelatin into sizable, 1-pound megavitamins molded to look like skittermanders and available in various artificial flavors and colors.</p>\n<p>It takes 5 minutes to consume a replenigel megavitamin. You gain 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Diseases} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} for the next 24 hours. In addition, you don’t need to eat food or water for 24 hours. If you subsist on replenigel megavitamins for 5 consecutive days, you must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the end of that fifth day and on each subsequent consecutive day you continue to eat these megavitamins; the bonus from the megavitamin doesn’t apply to this save. Failure means you develop a waxy sheen on your skin that makes you smell vaguely like a fermented version of the flavor of megavitamin you most recently consumed. Your skin remains this way for 1d4 days, during which time you take a –4 penalty to all Charismabased skill checks; if you consume another megavitamin during this time, the duration is increased by 1 day.</p>"
