A melee weapon with this fusion gains the thrown special property with a range increment of 10 feet. If the weapon has an item level of 10 or higher, the range increment is 20 feet. This fusion allows you to add additional fusions that benefit thrown weapons. You must be proficient with a melee weapon with the <em>throwing</em> fusion in order to benefit from the thrown special property granted by it. Only melee weapons can benefit from the <em>throwing</em> fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
