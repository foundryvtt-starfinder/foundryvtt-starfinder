      "value": "<p>A Veskarian corporation, Brortrav Ordnance Factories manufactures a wide range of personal weaponry, but it is most famous for its specialty heavy weapons that incorporate menacing decorative elements such as spikes and fanged maws. These motifs are intended to be stylish, and yet unnerving to your foes. When you fire a Brortrav heavy weapon, targets take a â€“2 penalty to attack rolls for attacks of opportunity made against you as a result of that ranged attack. Brortrav heavy weapons cost 10% more than normal and have a bulk 1 higher than normal.</p>",
