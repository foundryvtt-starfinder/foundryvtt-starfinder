As a full action, you can create a globe of force that functions as resilient sphere but contains only you. The effect has a duration of concentration, to a maximum of 1 minute. Alternatively, as a full action, you can attempt to place another creature that is your size or smaller within a globe of force that is just large enough for the creature to fit in without squeezing. To do so, you must hit that creature with a melee attack against its EAC; instead of adding your Strength modifier to this attack roll, you can add your key ability score modifier if it is higher. Once you use your force palms, you can’t use them again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.vYw5lZM5hlUPsyLA]{Resilient Sphere}</p>"
