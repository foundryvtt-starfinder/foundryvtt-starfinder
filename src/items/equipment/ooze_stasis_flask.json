      "value": "<p>An ooze stasis flask is a transparent cylinder 12 inches long and 3 inches in diameter. One end of the cylinder features a latched and hinged flap. Designed to contain an ooze, the flask is reinforced on the interior with invisible force fields that harmlessly compress such a creature, which is usually inserted via the means of a funnel or other implements (a prod is often required to force the ooze to comply).<br />An ooze stasis flask can hold one Medium or smaller ooze of CR 3 or lower. When the flask is sealed, the contents are placed in a stasis field, preventing the ooze from aging or needing any sort of sustenance. An ooze stasis flask can be thrown as an improvised grenade-like weapon as a standard action, or manually poured out as a full action. If thrown, the flask is destroyed and its contents immediately expelled.<br />An ooze stasis chamber uses a standard battery and expends 1 charge per day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Capacity&nbsp;20;&nbsp;Usage&nbsp;1/day</p>"
