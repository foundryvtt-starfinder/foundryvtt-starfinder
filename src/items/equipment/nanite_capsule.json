While standard operating procedure mandates the destruction of these nanites to prevent any possibility of future replication, scientists have recruited adventurers to obtain such samples for study in the hopes of recovering data from the parent goo and learning more about its strange abilities.</p>\n<p>An ambitious scientist or inventor, their identity lost to the Gap, eventually found a use for the inert goo in the form of ingestible capsules. However, because of the pill’s unpredictable results and the lack of a steady and reliable supply of raw material, it quickly became a hot black market item. Some claim it has the power of transforming the living into constructs, while others claim it simply functions as an expensive placebo.</p>\n<p>As a move action, you can swallow this silvery, one-time-use pill to hopefully gain an edge on the competition, though you risk deleterious side effects.
