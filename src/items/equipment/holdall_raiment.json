A holdall raiment features a dozen pockets, each of which can access a series of linked extradimensional pockets. Each pocket can hold a single item that weighs up to 1 bulk, though any item stored within the raiment can be retrieved from any pocket as a move action, but only by the wearer of the raiment. The stored items cannot be detected by anyone searching or frisking you.</p>\n<h2>Relic</h2>\n<p>These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the itemâ€™s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p>"
