      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This tiny ornamental copper lantern draws inspiration from the Eldest known as the Lantern King, a notorious trickster fey. The lantern is typically worn as a necklace or belt bauble, and its interior dances with a magic red flame that sheds no appreciable heat or light. While wearing the lantern, you&rsquo;re aware of any magic that would discern or prohibit your lying, even if it has failed to affect you, and you gain a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws against such effects. Once per hour when a creature within 30 feet of you rolls a natural 1 when attempting a skill check or saving throw, you can intensify their failure as a reaction, causing additional minor mishaps that give the target your choice of the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.v9RNVTqyTyaPchvd]{Bleeding 1d8}, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed}, or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} conditions in addition to any other effects of failure. The flat-footed and off-target effects last 1 round, and the bleeding effect ends after 1d4+1 rounds if not stopped earlier.</span></p>"
