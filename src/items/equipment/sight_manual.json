It may be a loop with an incorporated reticle, or a series of guidelines with high-visibility pigment on them, or some other simple design aid to aiming your weapon. A sight attaches to a small arm or railed weapon&rsquo;s top rail. A sight can&rsquo;t be added to a weapon with a scope. As a move action, you can aim through a sight. This can be done as part of the same move action as is required to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special quality, or as part of a @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.MBNI94tbMoqizPUk]{Trick Attack (Ex)} where you do not take any movement even if you also aim a sniper weapon as part of that action. Aiming through a sight reduces penalties to attack rolls due to range or bonuses to AC from cover, depending on the sight&rsquo;s type. The reduction in penalties due to aiming with a sight applies only to the next attack roll you make with the weapon before the end of your next turn.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponAccessories_ctl00_LabelName\">A manual sight reduces penalties due to range and AC bonuses from cover by 2.</span></p>",
