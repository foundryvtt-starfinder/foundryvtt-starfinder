      "value": "<p>The sleeping sentry is an exoskeletal harness equipped with an automated medical unit that can deliver pharmaceuticals intravenously, all mounted vertically atop a disk large enough for a Medium creature to stand on. Sleeping sentries are often used by eccentric corporations or military organizations that want round-the- clock non-automated security patrols but who don’t want to pay for multiple shifts. You activate a sleeping sentry by leaning back into the exoskeletal harness, allowing it to gently lock you into a standing position while supporting your neck, spine, legs, and arms. The automated medical unit then injects you with a cocktail of barbiturates that puts you instantly to sleep for the next 8 hours (or until awoken by the sleeping sentry); an unwilling creature forced into the harness can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to remain conscious. Shortly thereafter, antigravitry circuitry within the disc activates, suspending the entire structure approximately 1 inch off the ground and moving along a preprogrammed patrol route at a speed of 20 feet. The disc can move over land and over water, but not underwater.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures who come within 30 feet of an activated sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 25 Stealth check to fool the sleeping sentry’s motion detectors, or else an integrated high-frequency proximity alarm sounds, waking you and releasing you from the harness to confront the threat. Any creature that is more than 30 feet away from a sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 22 Perception check to recognize its occupant is asleep or a DC 20 Engineering check to identify the device.</p>"
