Once the compass is registered this way, the compass needle points toward the creature, regardless of distance. If the registered creature dies or is on a different plane from the compass, the deviceâ€™s needle wobbles indecisively. More sophisticated models can register more than one creature, and the wielder simply needs to think about the creature they want to locate to have the compass switch targets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 1):&nbsp;</strong> The compass can register one creature.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 4):&nbsp;</strong> The compass can register up to four creatures</li>\n</ul>"
