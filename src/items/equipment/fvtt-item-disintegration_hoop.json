      "value": "<p>This adamantine ring is 1 foot in diameter and surrounded by coils and circuitry. When activated, the disintegration hoop completely obliterates all matter placed through the center. Creatures that place an appendage into the hoop take 4d20 electricity and fire damage as the appendage is disintegrated, and creatures small enough to fit entirely within the hoop instead take 14d20 electricity and fire damage. In either case, a creature that would be forced through the hoop can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to avoid passing into the hoop. Appendages destroyed by the disintegration hoop can be restored only with&nbsp;regenerate&nbsp;or a similarly powerful effect; creatures slain by the hoop can be restored only with&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish. Attempts at creating larger disintegration hoops have thus far been disastrous failures, although rumors persist of larger, stable disintegration hoops that use advanced technology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>100;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>10/round</p>",
