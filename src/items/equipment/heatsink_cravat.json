      "value": "<p>This garment is worn over the exterior of armor, often around the neck or head. Woven from golden nanotubes, a heatsink cravat converts heat energy into cold. It functions like a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://aonsrd.com/OtherItemsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Environmental&amp;Family=Clothing\">heat climate environmental clothing</a>&nbsp;without consuming any charges. If you gain the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition while wearing the cravat, it activates automatically, reducing the amount of damage you take from the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition each round by 1 (minimum 0) for as long as it is active. In addition, while a heatsink cravat is active, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws to end the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition, which stacks with any bonus from previously failed attempts to end the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition.<br /><br />A heatsink cravat uses a battery, and each round of use consumes 1 charge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/round</p>",
