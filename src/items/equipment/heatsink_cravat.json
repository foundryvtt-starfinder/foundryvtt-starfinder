It functions like a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://aonsrd.com/OtherItemsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Environmental&amp;Family=Clothing\">heat climate environmental clothing</a>&nbsp;without consuming any charges. If you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition while wearing the cravat, it activates automatically, reducing the amount of damage you take from the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition each round by 1 (minimum 0) for as long as it is active. In addition, while a heatsink cravat is active, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws to end the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition, which stacks with any bonus from previously failed attempts to end the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.8LdyXZl9PeXXFE8O]{Burning} condition.</p>\n<p>A heatsink cravat uses a battery, and each round of use consumes 1 charge.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/round</p>"
