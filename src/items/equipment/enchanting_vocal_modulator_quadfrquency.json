      "value": "<p>Your voice box has an enchanted digital modulator that can alter its frequency to be supernaturally compelling. As a move action you can calibrate it to a single creature that you have heard and understood speaking or using other sound-based communication. It remains calibrated to that target until you pick a new target. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to influence that creature using your voice (not other forms of communication). In addition, you can cast <em>suggestion</em> once per day (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) as a standard action, targeting a creature your system is calibrated to.</p>\n<p>A <em>duofrequency enchanting vocal modulator</em> can target two creatures at once. It can be calibrated to two targets with a single move action, and its suggestion function can be used to target both with a single command. Similarly, a quadfrequency enchanting vocal modulator can target up to four creatures.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.nmBeoZQUNcZw7nmy]{Suggestion}</p>"
