You can activate and deactivate your artificial third eye with a move action. When activated, an artificial third eye collects X-ray data and relays the information gathered directly to your eyes. You gain sense through (vision) with a range of 30 feet, though your vision is limited to black-and-white. The amount of visual information you receive when your artificial third eye is active can be distracting, imposing a â€“4 penalty on initiative checks.</p>"
