The following tool kits supplement those presented on page 221 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook&nbsp;and provide circumstance bonuses to one or more skills in specific situations. These tool kits include the following: animaltrainer’s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks to handle an animal or rear a wild animal), astrogator’s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Piloting checks to navigate or astrogate), aura-translation kit (grants a +4 bonus to Mysticism checks to identify a magic item), broad-spectrum scanning kit (grants a +4 bonus to Perception checks to search), light-scattering sniper’s blind (grants a +4 bonus to Stealth checks when sniping), <strong>mental interpretation kit</strong> (grants a +4 bonus to Sense Motive checks to discern a secret message out of combat), personal gravitational redistributor (grants a +4 bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance out of combat), and thieves’ tools (grants a +4 bonus to Computers checks to hack a computer system that controls a door and a +4 bonus to Engineering checks to disable a mechanical or technological lock). When using a thieves’ tools tool kit for its specialized purpose, you don’t take the –2 penalty to Engineering checks if you don’t have an engineering kit.</p>"
