Most maps are digital files that can be downloaded onto a computer, but physical maps are also available. The prices listed on Table 1–31 are for both digital or physical maps. There are two broad categories of maps: survey and navigational. In addition, maps differ based on the size of the area they cover: local maps depict an area up to 1,000 square miles, regional maps depict an area up to 10,000 square miles, planetary maps depict an entire planet, and system-wide maps depict an entire star system.</p>\n<p>A map grants you a circumstance bonus to Survival checks perform the orienteering task or Piloting checks to navigate within the region detailed by the map; survey maps grant a +1 bonus, and navigational maps grant a +2 bonus. You gain the bonus for using a map only if you are traveling directly through the area depicted by the map. For instance, you gain no bonus from a planetary map when navigating on foot through the streets of a settlement, but you would gain the bonus when plotting a course to a different location on that planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigational maps are based on detailed explorations. They are extremely accurate and have in-depth detail on the detailed region’s features.</strong></p>"
