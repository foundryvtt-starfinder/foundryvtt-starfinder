      "value": "<p>As the scions of angels and other celestial beings, aasimars can shed an almost holy light. With thousands of photonproducing cells embedded under your dermal layer (or similar system), you can also glow brightly. As a standard action, you can cause light within 20 feet of you to increase two steps (up to bright) and light for 10 more feet beyond that to increase one step (up to normal). This lasts for 1 minute, but you can dismiss it as a swift action. Magical darkness can decrease the light level in this area only if it&rsquo;s from an item or creature of a level or CR higher than your level. You can use this ability once per day, plus a number of additional times equal to half your level.</p>",
