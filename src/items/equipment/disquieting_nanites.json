      "value": "<p>This augmentation infuses your skin with a host of iridescent nanites that swirl in hypnotic patterns. Internally, some of the nanites cluster around your voice box, slightly modifying your voice to create a kind of rhythmic reverberation. As a standard action, you can activate the nanites. After the first round, you must use a swift action each round to maintain the effect. A creature that can see or hear you when the nanites are activated must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or be @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} for as long it can see or hear you and you continue the effect. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it is immune to the effect of the nanites for 24 hours. You can choose for the nanites to not affect allies. If the creature can both see and hear you, it takes a â€“2 penalty to the saving throw. This is a mind-affecting, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent} effect. You can use the augmentation for 8 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>"
