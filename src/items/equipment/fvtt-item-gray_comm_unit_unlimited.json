      "value": "<p>A gray comm unit, a bizarre device made of smoky crystal and wires of gold and silver, functions like a normal comm unit, except it sends only telepathic signals. You must identify the receiver, who must also have a gray comm unit, which notifies the receiver of an incoming message. To send or receive the message, you must have limited telepathy or telepathy, or you must cast mindlink (an exception to that spell&rsquo;s normal targeting) or telepathy targeting the gray comm unit. Either spell retains its other parameters, such as duration. A mystic using the mindlink class feature can target a gray comm unit with the spell any number of times per day, even if the message comes from or goes to the same creature. Three kinds of gray comm unit units see use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Few have seen these massive gray comm unit units, which take up a small room and highjack Drift beacons to transmit their telepathic signals across interstellar distances.</p>",
