      "value": "<p>This fledgling Brethedan company seeks to make weapons less unwieldy for flying customers by incorporating a context-sensitive air bladder unit into larger weaponry. The corporation only manufactures weapons of 2 bulk or more. Its signature modifications, which give a weapon the living special property, reduce the weapon’s bulk by 1 and reduce the minimum Strength score required to wield the weapon by 2. These benefits apply only while in an atmosphere and increase the price of the weapon by 40%. Whirlwindustries hasn’t yet perfected its design to function across all environments; these weapons rupture and become broken when exposed to vacuum.</p>",
