      "value": "<p>This elaborate datapad has several additional audio receptors to capture nearby sounds. If you don&rsquo;t share a language with creatures you encounter, you can activate this device to collect basic linguistic information. The device requires 10 minutes of observed conversation to gain enough information to operate. The device then acts as a rudimentary translator. It does not allow you to converse with creatures with whom you don&rsquo;t share a language, but it can relate very basic information. Examples of statements the device could interpret would be: &ldquo;come with us,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower your weapons,&rdquo; or &ldquo;leave immediately.&rdquo; The device cannot parse proper names, including personal designations or the names of items and places. Some extraordinary complex or obscure languages might not translate clearly with this device.<br /><br />A Tetrad certified translator has 10 capacity and 1/hour usage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Capacity&nbsp;10;&nbsp;Usage&nbsp;1/hour</p>",
