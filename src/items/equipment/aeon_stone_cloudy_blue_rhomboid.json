This <em>aeon stone</em> can be activated once per day.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Aeon stones</h2>\n<p><em>Aeon stones</em>&nbsp;are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements.&nbsp;<em>Aeon stones</em>&nbsp;are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.</p>\n<p>Placing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em>&nbsp;must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em>&nbsp;has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand).</p>\n<p>Most&nbsp;<em>aeon stones</em>&nbsp;(including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>aeon stone</em>&nbsp;also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you.</p>"
