      "value": "<p>Stylemanders are fluffy, finger-sized, eight-legged grooming insects. Although nearly mindless, they&rsquo;re considered by some to be cute and useful. They are always spotlessly clean, are natural cleaners of other creatures, and even clean the glass jars in which they are kept. Their instinct to groom hair has made them popular among nuar, skittermanders, ysoki, and other shoppers with fur or furry pets, but occasionally even humans and lashunta use one in lieu of conventional combing routines. To use a stylemander, let it out of its jar and let it comb through your hair or fur for 5 minutes. It removes and eats bugs, parasites, dirt, and stray hairs. Some designer breeds are marketed for their tendency to comb fur into particular styles or patterns. A stylemander lives for about 3 months.</p>"
