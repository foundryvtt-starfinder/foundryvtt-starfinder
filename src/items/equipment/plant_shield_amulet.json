You can move through undergrowth that acts as difficult terrain (such as bushes, fungal blooms, roots, and vines) at your normal speed and without taking damage from thorns or similar elements of the plant life. Plant creatures&rsquo; attacks and abilities, as well as spells and other magical effects such as the xenodruid&rsquo;s grasping vines mystic connection power, affect you normally.</p>"
