For 1 round, the skin of the ovoid heaves and roils in waves that seem to be constantly falling in toward the ovoid and never rising out of it, yet the ovoid remains the same size. When an explosion or a weapon with the explode special property detonates within 30 feet of the explosion inhibitor, its explosion radius is halved (rounded down to the nearest increment of 5 feet, minimum radius of 5 feet). An explosion inhibitor can’t be harmed by explosives or weapons with the explode special property, regardless of the type of damage the explosion deals. An explosion inhibitor’s internal battery can’t be recharged by ordinary means, but when it’s within an explosion that deals at least 50 damage, it regains 1d6 charges, to a maximum of 10.</p>"
