To collect such memories, a telepathic artist interviews the subject along with those who know or have strong memories of the subject. This process takes at least a week. In the past, these objects were magical, and some still are, but most modern empathic depictions are hybrid items that use advanced holography to create realistic memorials. Creating such an empathic depiction is a crafting task that uses the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.76u4HnGcAlySicb4]{Engineering} skill or an appropriate artistic @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.bD4kmdFU7wwsenOf]{Profession} skill in a similar way. (A wholly magical version uses @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.HXcmgteT2OegqFrB]{Mysticism} instead.)</p>\n<p>Creatures within range of an empathic depiction (based on its model) can feel the emotions and recall the memories placed within it. A creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC based on the model) to resist these experiences, which cause no damage or harmful effect. These hybrid items utilize magic and psychic energy, remaining active while an observer is in range. They can also be plugged into a power grid and operate continuously while such power flows.</p>\n<p><strong>An empathic portrait is a handheld item that provides up to a 6-inch depiction. It must be touched to have an effect and has a DC of 12.</strong></p>"
