It has a pincher hand, a scoop, a low-power suction hose, and a strainer, each of which can be set as the active attachment. A sure collector can be attached to any flat surface that can support it with a full action. As a standard action, you can extend one of the collector’s attachments up to 10 feet and move one object of up to 1 bulk up to 10 feet. The sure collector includes a battery and uses 1 charge per minute of use.</p>"
