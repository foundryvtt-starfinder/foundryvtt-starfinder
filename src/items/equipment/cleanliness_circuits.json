This circuitry blends into your clothing and works to ensure that your outfit looks pristine even when it isn’t and cleans itself as fast as possible. Cleanliness circuits work by breaking up any substance that has attached to the clothing. If there’s more material than can be cleaned immediately, then a secondary feature removes the pigment from the material so that it at least blends in with the white clothing. Cleanliness circuits can be combined with @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.J45jy4henaOrz6bV]{Defensive threads} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.FlwWo6HJtIJSW3bP]{Sense silk} in a single outfit (paying each cost separately), and such an outfit counts as only one worn hybrid item.</p>"
