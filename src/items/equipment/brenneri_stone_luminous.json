Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the brenneri stone to gain an additional effect; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. After you use the stone, the radius of its light effect is reduced to 5 feet for 24 hours. You can gain the benefits of only one brenneri stone per day. Brenneris can use their favored object species trait with a brenneri stone and gain the benefits of both the item and the class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Luminous:</strong> You lose the fatigued condition or reduce your exhausted condition to fatigued. This doesn’t remove any underlying source of exhaustion or fatigue.</p>"
