Such weapons typically take on decorations of crossed blades, bundles of arrows, or similar sets of weaponry. When you use a <em>tactical</em> weapon to provide covering fire or harrying fire, the bonus granted increases by 1. This ability of this fusion doesn’t stack with other abilities that increase the bonuses provided by covering fire or harrying fire.&nbsp;</span></p>",
