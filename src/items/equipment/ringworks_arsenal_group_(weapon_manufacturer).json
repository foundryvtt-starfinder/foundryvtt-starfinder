      "value": "<p>When Vercite starship manufacturer Ringworks Industries formed a separate personal-scale energy weapons manufacturer as a wholly-owned subsidiary, its subsequent business and marketing decision sometimes left audiences skeptical. The relatively recent Ringworks Arsenal Group has since won over numerous customers as its products remain sturdy, reliable, and functional. The Ringworks weaponry line includes a distinctive feature for customers who prove loyal to the brand: a Ringworks weapon can recharge its battery at specialized stations onboard any Large or larger Ringworks starship at no cost. This process takes 1 minute per charge. Ringworks Industries can include this functionality in any weapon with a battery, but the weapon costs 10% more than the listed price.</p>",
