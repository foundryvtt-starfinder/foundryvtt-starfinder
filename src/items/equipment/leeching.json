      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">The <em>leeching</em> weapon fusion gives a weapon the leech critical hit effect. When you score a critical hit with the weapon, if at least one target of the attack takes damage equal to the weapon&rsquo;s item level, you recover a number of Hit Points equal to the weapon&rsquo;s item level, in addition to any other critical hit effect. This healing restores Hit Point damage first, followed by Stamina Points. Any healing in excess of your Hit Point damage and Stamina Point damage is lost. Once you have benefited from this healing, you cannot benefit from the <em>leeching</em> fusion again until you take a 10-minute rest and expend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points.</span></p>",
