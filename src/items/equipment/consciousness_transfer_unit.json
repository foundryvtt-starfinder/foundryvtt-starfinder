In a process that takes 1 minute, a creature lying on the disk can attach electrodes to their head (or equivalent region) and transfer their mind into a computer or construct adjacent to the consciousness transfer unit, functioning as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.dIjaNl0eUXdoFpnN]{Transfer Consciousness}COM(CL 14th). If the creature whose consciousness is transferred is unwilling, they can negate this effect with a successful DC 22 Will save. Once a creature has been affected by the device, whether the effect succeeded or not, they’re immune to that consciousness transfer unit’s effects for 24 hours.</p>"
