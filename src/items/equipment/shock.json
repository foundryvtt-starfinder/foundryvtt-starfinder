You can activate or deactivate the shock fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with electricity (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the&nbsp;shock&nbsp;fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal electricity damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.</p>"
