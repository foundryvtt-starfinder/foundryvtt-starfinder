Xhinti tool kits include the following: a climbing kit (grants a +4 bonus to Athletics checks when climbing), demolitionist&rsquo;s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Engineering checks when arming and disarming explosives), linguist&rsquo;s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Culture checks when deciphering writing), portable weather station (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks when predicting the weather), starship repair kit (grants a +4 bonus to Engineering checks when repairing the hull of a starship), and survivalist&rsquo;s kit (grants a +4 bonus to Survival checks when enduring severe weather or living off the land). When using a demolitionist&rsquo;s kit or starship repair kit for its specialized purpose, you don&rsquo;t take the &ndash;2 penalty to Engineering checks if you don&rsquo;t have an engineering kit.</p>"
