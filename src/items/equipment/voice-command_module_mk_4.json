      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListArmorUpgrades_ctl00_LabelName\">This microphone-linked control module allows you to activate one of your armor&rsquo;s systems, such as environmental protections, with a verbal signal; no action is required. The function must require no more than a standard action for you to activate normally. Higher-end models can be linked to a number of different systems equal to the model number; different vocal commands activate each of these systems. At mk 2 and higher, this upgrade comes with an enviro-sensor built in.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListArmorUpgrades_ctl00_LabelName\"><br />When combined with a computer interface, this upgrade has a voice command module that functions as a number of extra control modules equal to its model number. This feature allows you to program the computer interface to automate each system linked to the voice-command module in the same way the computer interface can automate one system on its own.</span></p>",
