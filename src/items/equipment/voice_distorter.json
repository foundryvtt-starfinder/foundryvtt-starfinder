A voice distorter worn over the mouth converts the user&rsquo;s voice into an unrecognizable and obviously artificial tone. Any check attempted to identify the wearer&rsquo;s voice takes a &ndash;5 penalty, and such identification can succeed only by relying on speech patterns, distinguishing phrases, and other idiosyncrasies of the wearer&rsquo;s speech rather than the sound of the voice itself.<br /><br />If the distorted voice is recorded, a character can remove the distortion and reveal the speaker&rsquo;s original voice. Doing so requires a successful DC 21 Computers check. The decipherer gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check with access to an undistorted recording of the same voice.</p>"
