A voice distorter worn over the mouth converts the user’s voice into an unrecognizable and obviously artificial tone. Any check attempted to identify the wearer’s voice takes a –5 penalty, and such identification can succeed only by relying on speech patterns, distinguishing phrases, and other idiosyncrasies of the wearer’s speech rather than the sound of the voice itself.</p>\n<p>If the distorted voice is recorded, a character can remove the distortion and reveal the speaker’s original voice. Doing so requires a successful DC 21 Computers check. The decipherer gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check with access to an undistorted recording of the same voice.</p>"
