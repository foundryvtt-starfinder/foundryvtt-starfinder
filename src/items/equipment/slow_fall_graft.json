A mechanism implanted at the base of your spinal column (or similar structure) can be used in a similar fashion. As a reaction, you can spin a web balloon to slow your fall in an environment with atmosphere. You fall at a rate of just 60 feet per round and take no damage upon landing while the balloon is inflated (which is for 1 round per level you have or until you land, whichever comes first).</p>"
