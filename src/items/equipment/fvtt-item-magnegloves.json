      "value": "<p>These heavy, durable gloves have powerful electromagnets built directly into the palms and are designed to be worn either directly on the body, or over armor or protective gear. These magnets can be activated as a move action, providing you a +2 insight bonus to Athletics checks to climb metal surfaces, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against attempts to disarm you (per the disarm combat maneuver) of metal items that you&rsquo;re holding, consuming 1 charge every hour.<br /><br />As a move action while you are grappling a creature, you can cause the magnegloves to draw together more powerfully, increasing the DC of the Acrobatics check to escape your grapple or pin by 2, or by 5 if the creature is wearing metal armor, carrying a significant amount of metal, or made of metal. You can unbind the magnegloves as a swift action. While set to draw together, the magnegloves consume 1 charge each round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>Varies</p>",
