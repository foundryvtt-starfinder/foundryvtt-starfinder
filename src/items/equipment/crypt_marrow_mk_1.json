Mk 5 crypt marrow allows you to spend 1 Resolve Point as a swift action to ignore the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{exhausted} or fatigued condition for 5 rounds. This doesn’t eliminate the underlying source of the condition, but these rounds count toward the condition’s duration.
