      "value": "<p>A wingsuit consists of a tight-fitting overall with smart-fabric membranes stretched between the arms and legs. When wearing a wingsuit, you can retract or deploy the membranes as a swift action. When the membranes are deployed, your falling speed is slowed, reducing the maximum damage you could take from a fall to 10d6 (rather than 20d6), and you act as if you deliberately jumped instead of fell. The wingsuit grants you a +5 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to reduce falling damage, as long as you are falling from a height of at least 30 feet. If you succeed at this check, you also don&rsquo;t land @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XeRGqHVtcZ7vsgJ0]{Prone}. If the result of this check exceeds 20, you reduce the damage by an additional 1d6, and if the result exceeds 30, you further reduce the damage by 2d6 (4d6 total). While falling with the membranes deployed, you can also make small adjustments to move yourself laterally, moving up to 10 feet for every round spent falling.</p>",
