When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the burdening fusion, the target gains the encumbered condition for 1d4 rounds. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can&nbsp; apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the burdening effect.</p>"
