A gunner harness reduces the minimum Strength score required to fire a heavy weapon without penalty, as determined by the harness’s type. In addition, when you fire the mounted weapon, reduce the total penalty you take for making a full attack and due to range by a value determined by the harness’s type. Donning or removing a gunner harness is a full action, and attaching a weapon to a gunner harness or removing it is a full action.</p>\n<p>A <em>null-space gunner harness</em> must be integrated into a heavy weapon.</p>\n<p>It functions like a <em>null-space grip</em> that turns the harness and its attached weapon into the disk. A <em>null-space gunner harness</em> otherwise functions as a heavy gunner harness.</p>"
