Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serumâ€™s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
