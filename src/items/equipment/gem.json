The value of a gemstone is determined by many factors, including size, rarity, clarity, cut, polish, and potential cultural influences. Gems considered of low quality are usually priced at 5&ndash;45 credits. Gems rated as semiprecious are generally priced at 50&ndash;95 credits. Gems rated as precious are generally priced at 150&ndash;450 credits, and those rated as jewels are generally priced at 1,000&ndash;4,500 credits. Gems rated as grand jewels are priced no lower than 5,000 credits, and the rarest and most valued can be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of credits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;Varies</strong></p>"
