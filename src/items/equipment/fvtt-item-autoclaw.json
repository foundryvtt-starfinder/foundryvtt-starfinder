      "value": "<p>This advanced device has adjustable arms that can be folded into multiple configurations, allowing you to bend, open, and twist objects made of metal and other durable materials. Powered by electric motors, an autoclaw takes 1 minute to configure for a specific task and has an effective Strength score of 30 (a +10 bonus) for the purpose of attempting Strength checks to break down doors and similar efforts; your own Strength score doesn&rsquo;t affect checks attempted with the autoclaw.<br /><br />Autoclaws are frequently used in tasks beyond industrial uses. Free Captains and other space pirates use autoclaws to open stolen containers, while the Stewards&rsquo; special tactical units use autoclaws to force doors open.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/round</p>",
