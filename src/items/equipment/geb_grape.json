A slogan at the bottom of the label reads, “Chase the ghoulish flavor!” The serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of undead creatures.</p><h2>Galorion World Serums</h2><p>The many restaurants and snack stands across Golarion World’s parks offer a variety of food and drink, including the fizzy, syrupy Golarion World serums, each of which comes in a different flavor and confers some beneficial effect upon drinking. Guests can purchase these serums by the bottle or have them mixed with tonic water or alcoholic spirit for a refreshing cocktail. Due to their popularity, New Horizons Luxury Retreats has begun selling its line of Golarion World serums across the galaxy, though the prices of the flavors presented here might be higher outside the theme parks.</p>\n<p>These serums function similarly to serums of enhancement (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 225), except where noted. They’re effective when imbibed by a living creature and last for 1 hour.</p><h2>Serums of Enhancement</h2><p>This vial of performance-enhancing serum unlocks or enhances aspects of your body and mind. Imbibing this serum grants a living creature bonuses based upon the type of serum imbibed, as described below. The effects of a serum of enhancement last 1 hour.</p><h2>Serums</h2><p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
