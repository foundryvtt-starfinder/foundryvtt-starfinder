      "value": "<p>A reusable battlefield trap that SDF soldiers deploy to secure locations and encampments against wild animals and smaller Swarm foes, a bug snare is four large metallic claws that extend outward from a central point and snap shut when disturbed. As a full action, you can set a bug snare at an intersection to cover a 5-foot radius. The next creature that steps into that radius sets off the trap and must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or take 1d4 piercing damage and gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} condition until it (or an adjacent ally) can extricate itself with a successful DC 14 Strength check as a standard action. An included wireless remote control can be used to disarm the trap from 15 feet away as a move action. You can attempt to hide a bug snare from view with a Stealth check (this check is opposed by the Perception check of a potential target). You can attach a bug snare to a fixed object (such as a nearby tree) with a length of cable line, rendering a trapped creature immobile, but this grants any creature attempting to spot a hidden bug snare a +2 circumstance bonus to its Perception check.</p>\n<p>A bug snare requires two hands to hold and set. It uses a battery and consumes 1 charge each time it is set.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/use</p>"
