For 1 minute, you can activate or suppress your X-ray vision as a move action. While your X-ray vision is active, you have @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#sense-through]{Sense Through} (vision) that can be blocked by 2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal. Your X-ray vision is black and white, and while you use it, you lose the benefit of any vision other than darkvision. In addition, while using X-ray vision, you can&rsquo;t attempt sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Serums</h3>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum&rsquo;s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
