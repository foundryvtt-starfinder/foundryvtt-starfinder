This fusion often makes the weapon pearly white with gold accents. You can add up to 400 credits of UPBs to a<em>manufacturing</em> weapon as a swift action. When you do, the fusion’s magic instantly manufactures ammunition inside the weapon worth an equal amount (which might mean recharging a battery) up to the maximum the weapon can carry. This ammunition is nonmagical and can be removed normally.</p>"
