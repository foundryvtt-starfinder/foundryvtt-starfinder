This artificial personality serves as a backup for the host that bolsters their mental faculties and can be activated when psychic attacks disrupt their free will. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saves against charm, compulsion, or mind-affecting effects. Once per day when you fail a save against a charm, compulsion, or mind-affecting effect, you can activate your backup personality by spending a Resolve Point to immediately reroll the save and take the new result.</span></p>"
