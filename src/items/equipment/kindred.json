Any attacks made with the weapon veer around creatures of the chosen species, taking a –4 penalty to hit and dealing the attack’s minimum damage to such creatures. These creatures don’t block or impede the weapon’s attacks, granting no soft cover for the attacks and not preventing a weapon with the line weapon special property from attacking creatures farther away from the weapon.</p>"
