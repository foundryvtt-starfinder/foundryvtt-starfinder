While curled into a defensive ball, you gain the ability to charge without taking the normal penalties to your attack roll or AC, and you gain a +5 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity during your movement. At the end of your movement, you can’t make a normal melee attack, but you can instead attempt either a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver against your target with a +4 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. Once you make a rolling charge, you can’t use this ability again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>"
