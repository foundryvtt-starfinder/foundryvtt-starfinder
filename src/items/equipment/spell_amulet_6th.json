      "value": "<p>Spell amulets can take many aesthetic forms, but in general, a spell amulet consists of a chunky piece of crystal mounted in a metal and silicon frame. A spell amulet functions in most respects like a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.w9spF6uxe3PzXLgB]{spell gem}, in that it grants the temporary ability to cast a spell encoded into the amulet without using one of your spell slots. You must be holding the spell amulet throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least a standard action using the spell amulet, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Only spellcasters are capable of using spell amulets—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge the amulet unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell amulet to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list) and you must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell amulet’s item level is higher than your caster level, once you’ve spent the full casting time of the spell, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell amulet’s item level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell amulet, the spell remains, and you can attempt to use the amulet again.</p>\n<p>However, unlike a spell gem, the mystical encoding within a spell amulet isn’t lost when the spell is cast, and it can be refreshed each day. To do so, a spellcaster must expend a spell slot of the same level as the level of the spell encoded within the amulet during their daily preparations, though the spellcaster needn’t know the spell originally encoded in the amulet. For instance, a spellcaster can expend a 2nd-level</p>\n<p>spell slot to replenish a spell amulet of invisibility even if invisibility isn’t on their list of spells known. A 0-level spell can’t be encoded into a spell amulet.</p>\n<p>A spell amulet can’t be used with a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.Pyir6Wr0AjG2ttcJ]{spellthrower} weapon, but it otherwise counts as a spell gem for the purpose of a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.luVYStId3CvCDUfY]{psacynoid’s} @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.yxRrBWOdw8Siif79]{crystal crafter} ability.</p>\n<p>To craft a spell amulet, you must know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{raise dead}), they must be provided while crafting the amulet and each time it’s refreshed, and the amulet’s price is increased by the price of the components.</p>\n<p>Like spell gems, you can create compound spell amulets holding multiple spells, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it plus an additional 10% of that total. Such spell amulets can be used to cast only one spell at a time.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can affix a spell amulet to a weapon or suit of armor in a process that takes 10 minutes. Only one spell amulet can be affixed to a single weapon or suit of armor. When the spell within the amulet is cast, you gain a temporary benefit depending on the spell’s school of magic (below); you must be wielding the weapon or wearing the suit of armor to gain this benefit. You can remove a spell amulet with another 10 minutes of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Abjuration:</strong> You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC until the end of your next turn; this bonus increases to +2 if the spell cast is 4th level or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Conjuration:</strong> You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Divination:</strong> You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws until the end of your next turn; this bonus increases to +2 if the spell cast is 4th level or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Enchantment:</strong> As a reaction immediately after casting the spell, you can attempt a ranged attack against the EAC of a target within 20 feet. If successful, the target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.aAQ6SW6iK0EVq8Ce]{staggered} until the end of its next turn; if the spell cast is 4th level or higher, the target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.CvsDp0GvojxiF2jz]{stunned} instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Evocation:</strong> As a reaction immediately after casting the spell, you can attempt a ranged attack against the EAC of a target within 20 feet. If successful, an energy ray deals 1d4 damage per level of the spell cast of an energy type of your choosing.</p>\n<p><strong>Illusion:</strong> Each enemy within 10 feet of you is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{dazzled} for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s level.</p>\n<p><strong>Necromancy:</strong> As a reaction immediately after casting the spell, you can attempt a ranged attack against the EAC of a target within 20 feet. If successful, the target is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{sickened} for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s level.</p>\n<p><strong>Transmutation:</strong> Your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn; this bonus increases to 20 feet if the spell cast is 4th level or higher.</p>\n<p>The cost and item level of a spell amulet depends on the level of the spell within.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>SPELL LEVEL</td><td>ITEM LEVEL</td><td>PRICE</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>5</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>8</td><td>8,000</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>11</td><td>21,000</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>14</td><td>58,000</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>17</td><td>200,000</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><em>Enable/disable modifiers in the Modifiers tab.</em></p>"
