The weapon gains the stunned critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the stunned effect. Only weapons that deal sonic damage can benefit from the temporal disruption fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you can apply the stunned critical effect only if one of those damage types is sonic.&nbsp;</span></p>",
