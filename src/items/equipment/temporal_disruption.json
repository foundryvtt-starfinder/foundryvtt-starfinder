The weapon gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned} critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned} effect. Only weapons that deal sonic damage can benefit from the temporal disruption fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you can apply the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Stunned} critical effect only if one of those damage types is sonic.</p>"
