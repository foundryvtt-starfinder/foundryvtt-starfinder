This fluid could then be used to flood entire medical facilities, creating a restorative environment for sivv patients whose natural healing was stimulated by the drained life force. Life fluid can be concentrated, making an excellent emergency medicine for the treatment of disease, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison}, or wounds.<br />A life fluid hypopen is a one-use device like other hypopens in size and usage, requiring a standard action to activate. A single life fluid hypopen restores 10d8 Hit Points and affects the subject with greater remove condition.</p>"
