Additionally, you can deploy these gliders while falling to slow your descent to 60 feet per round and move horizontally at a rate of 5 feet for every 1 foot you fall. While the glider foils are deployed, your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). The glider foils have no power of their own and don’t allow you to gain altitude.</p>"
