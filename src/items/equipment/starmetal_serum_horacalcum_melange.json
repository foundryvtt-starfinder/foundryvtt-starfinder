If you change shape again, or revert to your true form, the effect of the horacalcum mélange ends. If a you don’t change shape within 24 hours of drinking a horacalcum mélange, the serum has no effect, and a horacalcum mélange has no effect on a creature without the change shape species trait.</p>\n<h2>Serums</h2>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
