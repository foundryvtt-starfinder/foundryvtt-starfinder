      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListOtherItems_ctl00_LabelName\">Although this high-tech suit offers little protection against attack, it does provide all the same @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} as a suit of armor (see page 196). Unlike armor, a space suit is not designed for the rigors of combat. Whenever you take damage while wearing a space suit, you must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC equal to the damage dealt) or the space suit&rsquo;s life systems suffer catastrophic failure, gaining the broken condition and losing all @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} in 1d6 hours unless the suit is repaired. If you fail such a saving throw while the suit already has the broken condition, you lose all @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} in 1d6 minutes unless the suit is repaired. You can&rsquo;t wear a space suit while also wearing any type of armor, even if that armor is broken.</span></p>",
