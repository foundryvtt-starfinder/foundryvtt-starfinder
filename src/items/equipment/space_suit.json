Unlike armor, a space suit is not designed for the rigors of combat. Whenever you take damage while wearing a space suit, you must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC equal to the damage dealt) or the space suit&rsquo;s life systems suffer catastrophic failure, gaining the broken condition and losing all @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} in 1d6 hours unless the suit is repaired. If you fail such a saving throw while the suit already has the broken condition, you lose all @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} in 1d6 minutes unless the suit is repaired. You can&rsquo;t wear a space suit while also wearing any type of armor, even if that armor is broken.</span></p>"
