You still must eat, but you suffer no ill effects from eating spoiled food and gain a +4 enhancement bonus against ingested drugs and poisons, unless they specifically affect undead. In addition, you can extrude your squirming entrails from your mouth as a move action and use them almost like an additional limb, though you can’t speak, ingest anything, or hold your breath while doing so. You can retract your squirming entrails as a move action.</p>\n<p>Each model of squirming entrails functions differently when extruded: mk 1 squirming entrails help you keep your balance, so you don’t take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{flat-footed} condition when you are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.QnGpBSHSTiszjPSb]{off-kilter}, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0#balance]{balance}. Mk 2 squirming entrails function as mk 1 squirming entrails, except that they also allow you to stand from prone as a swift action. Mk 3 squirming entrails function as mk 2 squirming entrails and are also prehensile, allowing you to hold an additional hand’s worth of equipment. Mk 4 squirming entrails function as mk 2 squirming entrails and allow you to hold two additional hands’ worth of equipment. Mk 5 squirming entrails function as mk 4 squirming entrails and, when not holding any objects, can perform an attack five times a day identical to that of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.equipment.6jdDkLYrMqBEKTBM]{mk 3 ghoul glands}. Squirming entrails that allow you to hold more equipment don’t increase the number of attacks you can make in combat, but they allow you to store a single object of light or negligible bulk inside your body when you retract them. An external examination or a tactile search can’t detect the hidden object, but most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect it.</p>"
