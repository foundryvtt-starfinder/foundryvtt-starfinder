While you wear the amulet, if a spell includes you as a target, the necklace allows you to use the counter option of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.KQ4vSfG9tq8EJxir]{Dispel Magic} against that spell as a reaction. You must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + half the amulet’s item level + your key ability score modifier). A captive-star amulet works once per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate it a second time during that same day. Once you use a given captive-star amulet, you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Captive star amulets&nbsp;come in three types with varying functions.</p>\n<p><strong>A&nbsp;pulsar captive-star amulet&nbsp;can function like a&nbsp;magnetar captive-star amulet. Alternatively, instead of negating and absorbing the spell, you can redirect the spell. You choose the spell’s new targets, area, or other variables, but statistics determined by caster level are still calculated according to its original caster.</strong></p>"
