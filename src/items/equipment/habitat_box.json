Habitat boxes are typically used by explorers and naturalists to preserve samples, but couriers and smugglers also find them useful. The box has an adjustable temperature and humidity to keep the interior at a consistent environment, and food and water dispensers can sustain creatures stored within for as long as the box has power. The standard habitat box is a cube 2 feet square, although interior dividers allow you subdivide the box into several smaller compartments, each with their own isolated environment.</p>"
