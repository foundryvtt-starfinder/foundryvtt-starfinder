For 10 minutes, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.universal-creature-rules.Item.WYinJZZxKYueyaY1]{Amorphous} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.universal-creature-rules.Item.sguC9bc7vP22wrXW]{Compression} universal creature rules. Most users find this experience wildly disorienting. For the serum’s duration, your speed is halved and you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} condition. As a standard action, you can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save, ending the serum’s effects early if you succeed.</p>\n<h3>Serums</h3>\n<p>Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.</p>"
