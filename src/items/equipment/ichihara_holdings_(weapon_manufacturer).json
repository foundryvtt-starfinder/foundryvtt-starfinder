      "value": "<p>Ichihara Holdings weaponry is often found in the hands of Xun working for the Golden League, every investigation into the company has failed to uncover any formal links to the crime organization. The company itself claims its weapons are simply popular with some groups because of the ingenious solutions devised by their engineering teams to create equipment—from pistols to vehicles—with modular, interchangeable parts. All Ichihara Holdings weapons follow this standard and can be easily repaired, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to repair them. The company manufacturers most weapons, but specializes in advanced melee weapons. An Ichihara Holdings weapon costs 10% more than normal.</p>",
