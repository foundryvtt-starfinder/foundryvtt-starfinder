      "value": "<p>The static charge prevalent throughout Tarchuuva’s upper atmosphere has given rise to a recreational activity called static gliding. This leisure activity is restrictive due to the costs of the equipment and travel to Tarchuuva, but competitive static gliding was one of the most widely viewed sporting activities on Ilemchuuva.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;static glider&nbsp;is a thin metallic sheet incorporated onto a minimal nanocarbon frame roughly 10 feet across. You can strap into a harness on the glider’s underside, taking a full action. The glider’s surface is designed with a microtexture that allows it to build up an electromagnetic charge and use that energy to produce lift. A glider requires no power source on Tarchuuva or during electromagnetic storms, but otherwise, the device requires a battery and consumes 1 charge per minute. While using a&nbsp;static glider, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. You are @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-footed} while using the glider to fly unless you dedicate two hands to steering it.</p>"
