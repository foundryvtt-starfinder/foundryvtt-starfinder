      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">mind memory chip </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">resembles a thumb drive or similar data-storage device, albeit with a flesh-like exterior engraved with silvery outlines resembling a brain&rsquo;s folds. When held against the skin of a helpless or willing living creature for 3 rounds, the chip adheres to the creature, after which you can command the chip to download a specific memory (or memories from an unbroken stretch of time) from the host creature. The host creature can resist the chip in several ways. First, the host can attempt a Will save with a DC based on the device&rsquo;s model, becoming immune to that chip&rsquo;s memory extraction for 24 hours if it succeeds. Second, attaching the chip to a sleeping host is noticeable, and you must succeed at a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the host&rsquo;s Perception check (including only a &ndash;5 penalty for the asleep condition) to attach it without alerting the target.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">mind memory chip </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">detaches from the host creature easily and can be plugged into a computer to transfer and display the memories like a video or uploaded into another creature&rsquo;s memories through a datajack augmentation or similar device. A recipient can easily distinguish uploaded memories from their own, and even if the uploaded memories record educational material, the memories don&rsquo;t grant the recipient additional skills, languages, or abilities. The capacity of the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">mind memory chip </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">is dependent upon its model, as described below.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle4\"><strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The chip has a 10-minute capacity and Will save DC of 14</span></li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"fontstyle4\">Mk 2 (Level 8): </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The chip has a 1-hour capacity and Will save DC of 18.<br /></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle4\"><strong>Mk 3 (Level 14):</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The chip has a 1-day capacity and Will save DC of 22.<br /></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle4\"><strong>Mk 4 (Level 19):</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The chip has a 1-week capacity and Will save DC of 26.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /><br /></li>\n</ul>"
