      "value": "<p>This sturdy, metallic tripod can turn almost any gun into a semi-mobile turret, allowing soldiers to guard areas without putting themselves in harm’s way. It takes 10 minutes to attach or detach a non-analog longarm or heavy weapon to the emplacement; when attached to an emplacement, the gun can’t be wielded normally and can be fired only using the included wireless remote control that functions as a tier 1 computer with a control module. As long as the remote control is within 100 feet of the gun emplacement, you can use it to see through the emplacement’s camera (which has darkvision with a range of 30 feet) and operate the attached gun, either using your own ranged attack bonus with the attached weapon or allowing the computer to make the attack roll; the computer has a ranged attack bonus of +1 and proficiency with the attached weapon. Any weapon special properties and critical hit effects apply. When a gun emplacement gains the broken condition, you can no longer fire the attached gun.</p>\n<p>A gun emplacement uses a battery and consumes 1 charge per hour of use (or fraction thereof).</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/hour</p>"
