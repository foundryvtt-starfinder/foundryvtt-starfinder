When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the <em>charge disrupting</em> fusion, either the target or a single visible object carried by the target is subject to <em>discharge</em>, as the spell. The target creature (or its bearer, in the case of an object) can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect, as normal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the <em>charge disrupting</em> effect.&nbsp;</span></p>",
