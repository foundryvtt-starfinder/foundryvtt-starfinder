It contains miniscule pheromone emitters and holo-psychic transmitters to help you fit in as an ordinary member of any fairly large organization where the members don&rsquo;t all know one another well, like a mercenary company or employees in a corporate office. Generally, any organization with at least 50 members qualifies, but the GM makes the final decision. When you spend at least a minute interacting with an organization member, you can attempt a DC 25 Culture check. On a success, you learn enough for the fitting jacket to attune its emissions to that organization. Rank-and-file members of the organization have a starting attitude of indifferent toward you; to them, you appear to be wearing the appropriate uniform, have the appropriate credentials, and so on, even though you can&rsquo;t detect those details. The jacket can&rsquo;t make you appear as any specific individual, but you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a member of the chosen organization. If you fail the Culture check, the jacket can&rsquo;t attune to that organization for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>A fitting jacket can only be attuned to one organization at a time. Successfully attuning it to a new organization causes it to lose its attunement to the prior organization.</p>"
