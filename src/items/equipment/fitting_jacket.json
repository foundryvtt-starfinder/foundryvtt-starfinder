It contains miniscule pheromone emitters and holo-psychic transmitters to help you fit in as an ordinary member of any fairly large organization where the members don’t all know one another well, like a mercenary company or employees in a corporate office. Generally, any organization with at least 50 members qualifies, but the GM makes the final decision. When you spend at least a minute interacting with an organization member, you can attempt a DC 25 Culture check. On a success, you learn enough for the fitting jacket to attune its emissions to that organization. Rank-and-file members of the organization have a starting attitude of indifferent toward you; to them, you appear to be wearing the appropriate uniform, have the appropriate credentials, and so on, even though you can’t detect those details. The jacket can’t make you appear as any specific individual, but you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a member of the chosen organization. If you fail the Culture check, the jacket can’t attune to that organization for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>A fitting jacket can only be attuned to one organization at a time. Successfully attuning it to a new organization causes it to lose its attunement to the prior organization.</p>"
