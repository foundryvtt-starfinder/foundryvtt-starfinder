      "value": "<p>Barathus designed flight skins to help them move comfortably in the cramped spaces favored by many terrestrial species, but the modular design proved easy to adapt to other species. A flight skin comprises redundant layers of light, airy material that lie nearly flat and resemble rubber or soft cloth but, buttressed by bio-psychic force fields, briefly inflate to reduce sudden impact. Flight skin @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} take the form of a thin membrane that, when activated, envelops exposed skin.<br />When you fall or are hit by a falling object while you&rsquo;re wearing your flight skin, calculate the damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter.<br />The armors was developed by and designed for barathus; as such, they are highly adjustable, easily accommodating barathus&rsquo; ever-changing physiology. Reduce the DC for Engineering checks to adjust these armors by 5; if you pay a professional to adjust the armor instead of doing so yourself, the cost is 5% of the armor&rsquo;s purchase price.</p>",
