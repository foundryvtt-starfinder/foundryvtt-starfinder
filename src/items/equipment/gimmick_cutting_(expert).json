      "value": "<p>Agimmickis a small, handheld item, usable only by spellcasters, that focuses their spellcasting in a unique way. When you cast a spell, you can channel the magic through onegimmickyou’re holding to alter the spell, both changingany perceptible manifestations and effects in a specific way based on thegimmick. Once used to modify a spell, agimmickcan’t be used again until after you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge an attunedgimmickwithout spending an action.</p>\n<p>Agimmickrequires time to attune to a new user, functioning only once it has been in your possession for at least 24 hours. However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attune to a newgimmickwith only 10 minutes of concentration. Once attuned to you, thegimmicktakes a shape of your choice that reflects your personality and spellcasting tradition, appearing as a wand, mystical orb, engineering tool, or the like. A gimmick can’t be shaped into a functioning weapon, though it can take a weapon-like appearance. A technomancer can turn agimmickinto their spell cache by performing an 8-hour ritual, though if thegimmickspell cache is lost or destroyed, a newly created spell cache no longer has thegimmick’s properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting (Levels 2–10):</strong> Thisgimmickgrants you a bonus to any caster level checks you make to overcome targets’ spell resistance with the channeled spell, based on thegimmick’s model. This bonus does not stack with that provided by the Spell Penetration or Greater Spell Penetration feats.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apprentice (Level 2):</strong> The model’s bonus is +1.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Expert (Level 6):</strong> The model’s bonus is +2.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Master (Level 10):&nbsp;</strong> The model’s bonus is +3.</li>\n</ul>"
