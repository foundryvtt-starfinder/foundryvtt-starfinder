Once implanted, they produce modified dycepskian spores and stimulate growth of a mycelial network that snakes up the throat to expel the spores with great force. Once per day as a standard action, you can use your fungal breath on a creature within 15 feet. Unless it is immune to disease, the target is sickened for 1 day and, if it fails a Fortitude save, is stunned for 1 round. Creatures sickened by this effect who spend Resolve to regain Stamina Points can attempt the saving throw again, ending the condition on a success.</p>"
