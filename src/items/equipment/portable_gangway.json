      "value": "<p>When activated, this heavy, 1-foot-square metal box unfolds into a flat gangway up to 30 feet long and 10 feet wide that is capable of supporting up to 2 tons. The gangway is selfsupporting with struts that automatically unfold and brace it in place, as long as there is terrain to support the gangway on at least one end. The gangway can have an angle of up to 45 degrees when it is created, forming a ramp instead of a bridge. The portable gangway unfolds only partway if there isn’t room for the entire gangway, supporting as much of its size as can fit into the area. When a control stud at any of the gangway’s corners is pressed as a move action, the gangway refolds into a box around that stud, as long as there are no creatures or objects on the gangway.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/use</p>"
