All others hear nothing but the soft rush of breath sweeping through the instrument. When you play a shantak whistle for 1 minute, its song reaches out to the stars, and within 1d6 hours, a single shantak arrives at your location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once it arrives, a shantak is under no magical compulsion to serve you, but you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to skill checks to secure the shantak’s service as a mount (at the GM’s discretion, usually requiring @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.1tzIBDaDAO4hmX5C]{Diplomacy} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i]{Intimidate}) for one Large or smaller creature. Even a shantak compelled to serve as a mount usually refuses to participate in battle and is likely to cooperate only long enough for a one-way trip using its spaceflight ability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A shantak whistle can be used only once every 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.alien-archives.rd0AtjaMqZ8RI03A]{Shantak}</p>"
