      "value": "<p>Founded through an extremist arm of the church of Oras, Twisted Ribbon—a reference to the double helix of most species’ DNA—produces weaponry necessary for the church’s aim of unfettered evolution. Developed specifically for barathus, these weapons are designed to be easily smuggled into sensitive areas.</p><p>Twisted Ribbon can manufacture any weapon with the living property. Such weapons can be integrated with a barathu body as a standard action, their component materials dissolving and their structure written into the barathu’s DNA. Weapons integrated in this way cannot be disarmed or sundered. A barathu with the adaptation or early stage adaptation ability can draw a Twisted Ribbon weapon as an option of that racial ability. The cost for a Twisted Ribbon weapon is twice the listed price, given its strictly black-market nature, and a barathu may have only one Twisted Ribbon weapon integrated into their body at a time.</p>",
