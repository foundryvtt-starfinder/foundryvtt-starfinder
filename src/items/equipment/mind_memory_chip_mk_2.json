      "value": "<p>Amind memory chipresembles a thumb drive or similar data-storage device, albeit with a flesh-like exterior engraved with silvery outlines resembling a brain’s folds. When held against the skin of a helpless or willing living creature for 3 rounds, the chip adheres to the creature, after which you can command the chip to download a specific memory (or memories from an unbroken stretch of time) from the host creature. The host creature can resist the chip in several ways. First, the host can attempt a Will save with a DC based on the device’s model, becoming immune to that chip’s memory extraction for 24 hours if it succeeds. Second, attaching the chip to a sleeping host is noticeable, and you must succeed at a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the host’s Perception check (including only a –5 penalty for the asleep condition) to attach it without alerting the target.</p>\n<p>Themind memory chipdetaches from the host creature easily and can be plugged into a computer to transfer and display the memories like a video or uploaded into another creature’s memories through a datajack augmentation or similar device. A recipient can easily distinguish uploaded memories from their own, and even if the uploaded memories record educational material, the memories don’t grant the recipient additional skills, languages, or abilities. The capacity of themind memory chipis dependent upon its model, as described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 3):</strong> The chip has a 10-minute capacity and Will save DC of 14</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 8):</strong> The chip has a 1-hour capacity and Will save DC of 18.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 14):</strong> The chip has a 1-day capacity and Will save DC of 22.\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 4 (Level 19):</strong> The chip has a 1-week capacity and Will save DC of 26. <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\">\n</li>\n</ul>"
