      "value": "<p>A voice encoder, often simply called a voxbox, is a cybernetic augmentation of your throat. When activated, the device takes control of your voice, speaking instructions in the artificial language known as Vox. This instruction is concealed inside a conventional Common phrase. A primal voice encoder allows you to use <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.PVzsrE1TxBBjDLCa]{command}</em> as a spell-like ability. A sophisticate voice encoder allows you to use <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.nmBeoZQUNcZw7nmy]{suggestion}</em> as a spell-like ability. Using a voice encoder is a standard action. You can use a voice encoder once per day, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again immediately.</p>\n<p>Before you can use a voice encoder, it must be programmed at a computer that can communicate with the voxbox wirelessly, through a datajack, or some other direct means. Programming a voxbox takes 1 minute. You program the device with the specific command or suggestion, as well as the Common phrase in which the instruction is hidden. (For example, the suggestion “Kill Raia Danviri” might be hidden behind the phrase, “I’m from the Stewards. Let me show you my badge.”) Until the voice encoder is reprogrammed, it can be used only to give the chosen command or suggestion, which is always concealed within the same Common phrase.</p><h3>Suggestion</h3><p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.</p>\n<p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration of the spell. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell’s duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p>\n<p>A very reasonable suggestion imparts a penalty (such as –1 or –2) to the target’s saving throw.</p>"
