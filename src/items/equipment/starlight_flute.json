      "value": "<p>A starlight flute is an elaborately carved ritual bone flute based on a traditional @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.vBGA5tASjIErgZD2]{maraquoi} design. The flute sheds dim light in a 30-foot area. Once per day, you can play the flute as a full action to create an illusory effect made of music and starlight, replicating the effect of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.J1k3B5PmIc4SUC9L]{ghost sound} with a range of 30 feet. If you continue concentrating and playing as a standard action on following rounds, the illusion develops a visual aspect, instead functioning as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.kDFNOMx78KU1GGol]{holographic image} as a 2nd-level spell with a range of 30 feet. The Will save DC to disbelieve either effect is 13 or 12 + half your ranks in @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.bD4kmdFU7wwsenOf]{Profession} (musician), whichever is higher. The visual image the flute creates always has a luminous quality, and unless the image is one observers would expect to glow (such as a lantern, a cabin with lit windows, or a glowing celestial figure), an observer can automatically attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion without having to interact with it first.</p>"
