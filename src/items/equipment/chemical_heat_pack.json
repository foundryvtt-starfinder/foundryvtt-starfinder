While held against the body, an activated cold pack grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against hot environments. Once per day after being in contact with an activated cold pack for an hour, you also recover 1d4 Hit Points or Stamina Points lost due to hot environments or fire damage. Finally, if you have at least half of your maximum Stamina Points remaining and apply an active cold pack to your body while spending a Resolve Point to recover Stamina Points, you can recover the Stamina Points with 5 minutes of rest rather than 10 minutes.</p>"
