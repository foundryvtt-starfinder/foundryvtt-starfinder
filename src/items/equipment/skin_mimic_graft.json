With mere thought, you can control traces of potentiometric dye that have been injected throughout your skin. If you stay stationary for 1 round, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to Stealth checks (this bonus doesn&rsquo;t stack with the invisibility spell and similar effects). If you take any action, you lose this bonus until you once again spend 1 round remaining still. If you wear clothing or armor that covers more than one-quarter of your body, you can&rsquo;t use this ability.</p>"
