The specific effect depends on the purpose for which the seed was bioengineered.&nbsp;Vital seeds&nbsp;can grow livestock and plants, replace missing organs, and perform many other useful tasks. Some common vital seeds are listed here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>As a standard action, you can swallow a&nbsp;regrower vital seed. This allows you to regain 12d8 Hit Points and removes the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} and fatigued conditions. Any lost organs and limbs also start regrowing. If you can reattach a missing part, this regrowth takes only 1 round. Otherwise, it takes 2d10 rounds.</strong></h4>",
