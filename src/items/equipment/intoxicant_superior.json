      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListOtherItems_ctl00_LabelName\">The price and bulk listed here is of a single serving of an intoxicating beverage or inhaled substance, which in the Pact Worlds is most often alcohol or tobacco. An intoxicantâ€™s potency can be minor or superior. A minor intoxicant might be beer or wine, which takes a few servings to cause any physiological effects. A superior intoxicant is usually a strong spirit, such as whiskey, that can start producing effects after a single serving. Unlike @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, intoxicants are usually not addictive, although a GM might rule that a PC who partakes of too much of an intoxicant on a regular basis might begin to suffer the effects of an addictive @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drug} (as described in @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} on page 417).&nbsp;</span></p>",
