The most common of these is a stalkring, a band of stone or metal sized to be worn around a quorlu’s eyestalk. Creatures lacking such extremities can wear similar rings on a similarly slender appendage. Most stalkrings are decorative in nature, though the ever-pragmatic quorlus have also imbued some stalkrings with beneficial qualities.</p>\n<p>When you wear a <em>digger stalkring</em>, you gain a burrow speed equal to half your base speed and you can burrow through earth and stone that have a hardness up to 15. As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to step into an adjacent area of such material that can enclose a creature of your size. When you do so, you can sense any open area within 30 feet that is large enough for you to enter and adjacent to an area of solid rock big enough to enclose a creature of your size. You can choose to move into one of the open areas you sense. If you don’t or can’t move to such an open space, you emerge where you started, having still used the action and Resolve Point.</p>"
