A <em>vicious</em> weapon gains the boost special weapon property, but when you make an attack with the boosted damage, you take damage equal to the additional boost damage.

If the weapon does not use charges or ammunition, boosting it takes a standard action and does not expend any additional charges or ammunition. You cannot boost an attack made with the automatic, blast, explode, or line weapon special property. Weapons that have the boost special weapon property cannot be <em>vicious</em>.</p>"
