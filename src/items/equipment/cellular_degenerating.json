The weapon gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Degeneration} critical hit effect, dealing d6 equal to the weapon’s level divided by 5 (round down). You can activate or deactivate the cellular degenerating fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already has a critical effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Degeneration} effect. This fusion can never cause a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.</p>"
