The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use their embedded spell as a spell-like ability. If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of&nbsp;holding gloves, you canâ€™t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The spell imbued in&nbsp;holding gloves&nbsp;depends on their model, as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.W0oa8tqHXAcWNaGT]{Hold Person} (save DC = 12 + your key ability score modifier; caster level 5th)</strong></p>"
