It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. While you are wearing the armor and this upgrade has a charge, you ignore the effects of the shaken condition. When an effect would cause you to gain the frightened or panicked condition, as a reaction you can expend the device’s charge to be shaken for the same amount of time instead. The device’s charge replenishes each day.</p>",
