Using microscopic, spore-producing cells in your lungs (or similar organs), you can do the same. As a move action while in an atmosphere, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to release these spores into the air. When you use this ability, choose a type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will) and whether to enhance or penalize this save. If you choose to enhance, creatures within 20 feet of you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws of the chosen type for 1d4 rounds; if you choose to penalize, creatures within 20 feet of you take a &ndash;1 penalty to saving throws of the chosen type for 1d4 rounds. A creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Constitution modifier) before the bonus or penalty is applied to ignore this effect. This is an inhaled poison effect.</p>"
