      "value": "<p>This surprisingly light suit of hybrid powered armor uses technomagical microthrusters to grant you flight and incredible mobility. In its undeployed form, an angel frame looks and functions as a specific kind of clothing LEVEL 16 (Starfinder Core Rulebook 230), often an environmental outfit or travel outfit. In this form, an angel frame grants none of the effects of wearing powered armor and doesn&rsquo;t use charges. As a full action, you can speak a command word that causes pieces of the armor to deploy from extra-dimensional spaces and fit together around you. Once deployed, the angel frame functions as powered armor with the listed statistics. You can return the angel frame to its undeployed form as a full action by speaking the same command word. An angel frame that runs out of power stays in its deployed form and has a bulk of 18; you can still exit the armor as a full action.<br />Angel frames tend to resemble a gleaming suit of full plate perfectly tailored to your form, sometimes with wing-like protrusions at its shoulders; its appearance can also be subtly altered to fit your personal aesthetic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bulk:</strong> 18 (deployed), 1 (undeployed)</p>",
