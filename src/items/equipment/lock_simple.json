      "value": "<p>Locks are extremely advanced reusable devices, able to secure any fastening or closure by bonding with its surface and then holding fast. Locks usually open with a code, security chip, or voice command. Successful Engineering checks can disable locks. Locks come in four levels of quality&mdash;simple, average, good, and superior&mdash;which determine the DC of Engineering checks to open them without the proper key or code. A lock takes two hands to secure or open with a security chip. For more information on locks, including the Engineering DCs to open them, see the Engineering skill on page 141.</p>"
