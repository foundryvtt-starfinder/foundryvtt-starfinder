      "value": "<p>Weapons with the&nbsp;burning&nbsp;fusion often take on an appearance that includes numerous flame-like elements. However, if applied to a weapon that already has visual details representing crows or ravens, the fusion adds further raven-like flourishes to the weapon instead. A weapon with the&nbsp;burning&nbsp;fusion gains the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Burn} critical hit effect. The @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Burn} damage for the critical hit effect is 1d6 when the fusion is applied to a 4th- or 5th-level weapon, 2d6 when applied to 6th- to 10th-level weapons, 3d6 when applied to 11th- to 15th-level weapons, and 4d6 when applied 16th- to 20th-level weapons. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Burn} critical hit effect when you score a critical hit.</p>",
