You can trigger this gland as a standard action to expel a breath weapon in a 15- foot cone as an extraordinary ability. Choose the damage type when the organ is biocrafted, picking from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You are not harmed by using your own breath weapon. Once you&rsquo;ve used your breath weapon, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>\n<p>A wyrmling dragon gland deals 3d6 damage, a standard gland deals 9d6 damage, and a wyrm gland deals 18d6 damage. Targets in the area can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) to take only half damage.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.equipment.FAt6V9HDubZ9ZivD]{Dragon breath, wyrm}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
