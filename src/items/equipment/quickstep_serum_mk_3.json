      "value": "<p>This acrid golden potion is mixed with horacalcum shavings. When you drink this potion, you gain a magical reserve of power that you can expend to slip through time for a fraction of a second, granting you additional movement. This can’t be used in combination with other effects to gain more than one additional move action on a turn. This magical reserve lasts for 1 hour. During the serum’s duration, you can take an additional move action on one turn to move up to your speed. Higher level versions of this serum allow you to use this ability more than once. After you drink a quickstep serum, you can’t be affected by another quickstep serum for 24 hours. If you drink another quickstep serum in this time, the quickstep serum is expended with no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 1 (Level 4; 350 credits)</strong>: You can take an additional move action once during the duration of a mk 1 quickstep serum.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 2 (Level 8; 1,500 credits)</strong>: You can take an additional move action twice during the duration of a mk 2 quickstep serum.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 3 (Level 12; 5,700 credits)</strong>: You can take an additional move action three times during the duration of a mk 3 quickstep serum.</p>"
