It can be activated or deactivated as a move action to cause the crystal to resonate in a fashion that impedes psychic ability. Within 30 feet of any phrenic scrambler, limited telepathy does not function and other telepathic communication is hopelessly garbled unless both the sender and the recipient share a language.
