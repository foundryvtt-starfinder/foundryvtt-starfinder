      "value": "<h1>Glass Cutter</h1>\n<p>This tool consists of a tiny blade at the end of a short arm that is attached to the center of an adhesive disc. When the disk is attached to a smooth surface such as a glass window or panel, you can spin the blade-tipped arm in a circle around the disk to quietly cut a 1-foot-diameter circle out of the glass. More advanced models with adamantine-diamond alloy blades can cut through surfaces even harder than glass. The type of material a glass cutter can cut through depends on its model, as described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You can cut through transparent aluminum or any material with a hardness of 10 or less.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
