For those wishing to consume their chosen entertainment media, tried-and-true headphones of all varieties are still the galactic standard, as are speaker systems for those who enjoy sharing with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic (Level 1)</strong>: Basic headphones are available in hundreds of colors, patterns, and styles, each adaptable for members of all species. These vary from earbuds to ear covers that are connected with thin-but-flexible wires to their host comm units or media players. Some think this makes them old-fashioned, but audiophiles across the cosmos swear that their sound-quality is better than wireless varieties.</p>\n<p><strong>Wireless (Level 1)</strong>: Wireless headphones have the same variety as their basic counterparts, though they lack the wire that connects them to the device theyâ€™re linked to. The lack of tethering means there is no chance of getting anything tangled up, but it also increases the chances of electromagnetic interference or the risk of losing an earbud or ear cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Noise-Canceling (Level 2)</strong>: Available in basic or wireless varieties, noise-canceling headphones see widespread use in crowded places such as the spaceports of Absalom Station and the ever-open markets of Verces. At GM discretion, noise-canceling headphones can reduce penalties to skill checks due to loud distractions, though the same reduction applies to sound-based Perception checks.</p>"
