By focusing on a particular sample, the wearer can trigger magnification and a HUD that provides helpful analysis and commentary. Fung-eye goggles are popular among scientists, custodial employees, and school children. The latest model, however, can also identify dycepskian hosts and free-floating dycepskian spores.</p>\n<p>While you have fung-eye goggles activated, you have a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to spot bacteria, fungus, molds, spores, and similar organic material, and a +1 circumstance bonus to Life Science checks to identify these targets once you see them. These bonuses rise to +2 to spot and identify dycepskians, dycepskian spores, or creatures infested by dycepskian spores but who have not yet succumbed.</p>"
