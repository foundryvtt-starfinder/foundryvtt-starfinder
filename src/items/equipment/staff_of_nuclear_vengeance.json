      "value": "<p>The&nbsp;staff of nuclear vengeance&nbsp;is an 8th-level hybrid item of 1 bulk, and it costs 10,500 credits. It resembles an autoclaw fixed to the end of a long rod, with the claw gripping a small chunk of glowing nuclear material encased in an invisible forcefield. It can be used as either a melee weapon or a small arm. As a basic two-handed melee weapon, the staff deals 2d6 bludgeoning and fire damage with the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Irradiate} critical hit effect and has the special properties block and radioactive weapon. When the staff is used as a small arm, it has a range increment of 60 feet, and a single shot consumes two charges from its 40-charge capacity and deals 2d4 fire damage with the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Irradiate} critical hit effect and the radioactive weapon special property. Switching the staff from melee functionality to ranged functionality (and vice versa) is a swift action. Additionally, the staff may be loaded with a small piece of specially-crafted radioactive material costing 2,500 credits; the wielder may consume this resource as a standard action to cast @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Irradiate} as though using a spell gem, using his character level as his mystic level, even if he isn&rsquo;t a spellcaster.</p>",
