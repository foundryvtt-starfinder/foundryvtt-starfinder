When you acquire and install this augmentation, you choose one polymorphed form and its abilities, per the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.gNgdSyi4pXQmasmc]{polymorph}</em>. The spell level of the polymorph effect equals that of the augmentation’s model number (e.g. polymorph as a 4th-level spell for a mk 4 augmentation).</p>\n<p>As a reaction when you take a critical hit in combat or fail a Fortitude save, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate this augmentation; alternatively, you can activate the augmentation as a full action by spending 3 Resolve Points. Your body begins transforming into your polymorphed form, as though you were the target of a polymorph spell, completing its transformation at the beginning of your next turn. You retain your polymorphed form for 1 minute or until you end the effect as a standard action, after which you become fatigued for 1 minute. This transformation is an extraordinary ability that is not subject to dispel magic or similar effects.</p>"
