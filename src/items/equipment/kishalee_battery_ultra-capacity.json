By a strange quirk of fate and parallel engineering, kishalee batteries can be interchanged with the standard batteries used among the Pact Worlds and beyond, but these rare batteries allow a creature to use and kishalee artifacts with greater efficiency. If placed in non-kishalee items, a kishalee battery functions like a standard battery. The technology for rapid recharging of a kishalee battery has been lost, but such batteries recharge themselves automatically over the course of 24 hours of disuse.</p>\n<p>These batteries come in four different varieties: normal, high-capacity, super-capacity, and ultra-capacity. Each variety has a maximum number of charges as the normal batteries of the same type (Starfinder Core Rulebook&nbsp;179). When these batteries are found, they are almost always fully charged.</p>\n<h3>Relic</h3>\n<p>These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the itemâ€™s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.</p>"
