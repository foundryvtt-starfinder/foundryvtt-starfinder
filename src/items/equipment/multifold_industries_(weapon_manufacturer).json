      "value": "<p>One of Aballon’s leading manufacturers, Multifold is known not for ingenuity but for reliability. When calculating the hardness and Hit Points for a weapon manufactured by Multifold Industries, the item-level multiplier is 3 for hardness, rather than 2, and 4 for Hit Points, rather than 3. Multifold Industries makes all sorts of weapons, but the company’s superior craftsmanship results in its products costing 20% more than normal.</p>",
