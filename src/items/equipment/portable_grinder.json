      "value": "<p>Based on protocite reclaimers, this grinder has flat-toothed discs that interlock and rotate toward one another. A multistage mechanism allows these grinders to break material down into junk or polyfluid. The initial stage renders 1 bulk of technological items into 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment suitable as a target for some spells, such as&nbsp;battle junkbot. Further grinding produces polyfluid that flows into a swappable tank that itself weighs 1 bulk empty. Polyfluid can be gleaned from both analog and technological items. In any case, the material you produce is worth 10% of the original itemâ€™s value. The weight of the polyfluid produced is determined by that monetary value.</p>\n<p>A portable grinder requires a battery. It takes 1 charge and 1 minute to grind 1 bulk of items into junk. Another charge and minute are required to produce polyfluid.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong> 20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong> 1/use</p>"
