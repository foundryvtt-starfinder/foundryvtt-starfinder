      "value": "<p>Thin leather gloves that have delicate steel wires running through them,&nbsp;telekinetic gloves&nbsp;allow you to manipulate objects at a distance. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />While you wear the gloves, you can use @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.byAI5MUa3DgiiXc9]{Psychokinetic Hand} as a spell-like ability at will with a range of up to 30 feet. Once per day, the glove can be used to either use @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.OHGWvzUb9MJCNB8u]{Psychokinetic Strangulation} as a spell-like ability (range 30 feet, duration 2 rounds, save DC = 13 + your key ability score modifier) or attempt to disarm or trip a target within 30 feet of you. To attempt a combat maneuver, roll 1d20 + your level + your key ability score modifier against your target&rsquo;s KAC + 8. If you succeed at the disarm maneuver, you can bring the object to you, catching it in a hand you have free or allowing it to land in your space. After you use the gloves this way for the first time in a day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to do so again, up to two more times a day. Once you use a given pair of telekinetic gloves, you can&rsquo;t use a different pair for 24 hours.</p>"
