      "value": "<p>Xenobotanists have long been intrigued by the moonflower’s ability to produce powerful bursts of light. After many unsuccessful attempts to harness this capability from moonflower tissue alone, they discovered that grafting a bioengineered light-producing nodule to another living creature could give that host the ability to activate a similar light-burst effect. Given the strange thoughts of moonflowers, however, few customers elect to have such an augmentation installed.</p>\n<p>This implant can be used to produce light like a flashlight with a 30-foot cone, drawing power from you. In addition, as a standard action, you can raise your augmented hand and create a blinding burst of light in a 30-foot cone-shaped burst extending from your hand. A creature that can see in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} for 1d4 rounds. Once you activate this ability, you can’t activate it again that day unless you spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it.</p>"
