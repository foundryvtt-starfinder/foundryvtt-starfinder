      "value": "<p>Xenobotanists have long been intrigued by the moonflower&rsquo;s ability to produce powerful bursts of light. After many unsuccessful attempts to harness this capability from moonflower tissue alone, they discovered that grafting a bioengineered light-producing nodule to another living creature could give that host the ability to activate a similar light-burst effect. Given the strange thoughts of moonflowers, however, few customers elect to have such an augmentation installed.</p>\n<p>This implant can be used to produce light like a flashlight with a 30-foot cone, drawing power from you. In addition, as a standard action, you can raise your augmented hand and create a blinding burst of light in a 30-foot cone-shaped burst extending from your hand. A creature that can see in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.tOpF6qjnlnKc10t7]{Blinded} for 1d4 rounds. Once you activate this ability, you can&rsquo;t activate it again that day unless you spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it.</p>"
