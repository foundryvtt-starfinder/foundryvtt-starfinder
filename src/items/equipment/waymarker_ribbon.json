If you apply these to your path, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to orienteer, and other creatures following your trail gain a +5 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to orienteer and follow your tracks. The ribbon’s adhesive usually lasts for one month before losing strength. One roll of waymarker ribbon is typically sufficient to mark 20 miles of trail.</p>"
