      "value": "<p>The following weapon fusion uses a blend of magic and technology to adjust light patterns emitted from the weapon, simulating the oscillating glow of a hulsa which, under exactly the right circumstances, can temporarily beguile a target. The fusion sees regular use by commandos and raiders, who both exploit the light’s resulting confusion to strike hard and get away before their targets can mount a counterattack.</p>\n<p>The <em>kaleidoscopic</em> fusion augments a weapon’s attacks, causing them to appear unusually bright, colorful, and even mesmerizing. The weapon gains the kaleidoscopic charm critical hit effect. When this critical hit effect is triggered, the fusion converts the weapon’s force into a powerful enchantment. The target takes no damage from the attack and instead is charmed for 1d4 rounds, as though you had cast @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.SysRFlYml1f1Eofd]{Charm Monster} on it (Will save negates). If the target is immune to this effect or negates it with a successful saving throw, the target takes the double damage as normal. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has multiple critical hit effects, you can apply only one of those effects of your choice. This fusion can only be applied to weapons that deal electricity or fire damage, or that have the aurora, bright, or fiery weapon special properties.</p>"
