Helmets of this sort belonged to veteran warriors of ages past, each dent representing a potentially mortal blow the kasa deflected. You wear the kasa by incorporating it into part of your armorâ€™s headwear. The helmet counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.</p>\n<p>While wearing the dented kasa, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against critical hit effects. In addition, when you take a critical hit, you can spend 2 Resolve Points as a reaction to negate the resulting extra damage and critical hit effect. When you do so, the kasa gains a new dent, scratch, or other mark.</p>"
