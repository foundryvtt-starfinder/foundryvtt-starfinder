In addition, you can activate the graft to emit constant, erratic vibrations that interfere with blindsense (sound) and blindsight (sound). While activated, creatures can detect you with blindsense (sound) at only one-third the normal range, whereas creatures with blindsight (sound) gain only the benefits of blindsense when detecting you. The graft remains activated for 5 minutes or until deactivated, after which it can&rsquo;t be activated again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.</p>"
