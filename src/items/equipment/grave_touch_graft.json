With undead flesh grafted onto your hands (or similar appendages) or arcane mechanisms generating negative energy installed in your palms, your melee weapons become wreathed in darkness. You impart the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Leech} critical hit effect (AR pg. 31) to any melee weapon you wield, but the saving throw DC is 10 + your character level + your Strength modifier, and the duration of the effect is 1d4 rounds. In addition, when a creature fails its save against this @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Leech} critical hit effect, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half its CR or level. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you must choose which to apply on a critical hit.</p>"
