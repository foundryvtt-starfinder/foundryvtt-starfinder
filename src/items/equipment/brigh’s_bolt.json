      "value": "<p>This simple, shiny metal bolt is the size of a thumbnail and has an image of a tiny gear on its head. As a full action, you can affix a&nbsp;<em>Brigh’s bolt</em>&nbsp;to a broken suit of armor, tool, vehicle, or weapon to negate the penalties of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.0yJjfyvWg5pDLcVR.JournalEntryPage.qtS73Nr2s2OvQadu]{Broken} condition for as long as the bolt is affixed. The bolt does not repair any damage sustained by the object and the object is still visibly damaged, so its resale value is reduced as normal for a broken item. If the item is repaired so as to no longer have the broken condition, the Brigh’s bolt falls off; otherwise, it can be removed as a full action. If an item to which a&nbsp;<em>Brigh’s bolt</em>&nbsp;is attached is destroyed, the bolt is also destroyed.&nbsp;</p>"
