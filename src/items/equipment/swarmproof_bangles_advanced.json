When activated, they produce a broad-spectrum field around your body that repels vermin, making it difficult for Diminutive and Fine vermin to make physical contact with you.</p>\n<p>Advanced swarmproof bangles generate a more precise modulating field that impedes more than just vermin. You are not @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} when using advanced swarmproof bangles, and you have DR 10/— against the swarm attack of Fine creatures and DR 5/— against the swarm attack of Diminutive creatures.
