When activated, they produce a broad-spectrum field around your body that repels vermin, making it difficult for Diminutive and Fine vermin to make physical contact with you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Advanced swarmproof bangles generate a more precise modulating field that impedes more than just vermin. You are not @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled} when using advanced swarmproof bangles, and you have DR 10/&mdash; against the swarm attack of Fine creatures and DR 5/&mdash; against the swarm attack of Diminutive creatures. You also gain a +4 bonus to your AC against attacks by nanites or nanobots, such as those created by the&nbsp;inject nanobots&nbsp;spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>40; <strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/minute</p>",
