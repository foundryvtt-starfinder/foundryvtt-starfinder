Once per day when you use asuperchargingweapon’s boost weapon special property, you can activate the fusion to further empower the effect; for each of the boost property’s additional damage dice with a result less than that die’s average result, you treat the die’s result as though it had instead rolled the average result, rounded up (such as treating each 1, 2, or 3 for a d6 as though it were a 4). If the weapon doesn’t have the boost property, the fusion instead gives the weapon the boost property it can use once per day, dealing 1d6 additional damage for every 5 item levels the weapon has. This fusion can be applied only to weapons that use charges.</p>"
