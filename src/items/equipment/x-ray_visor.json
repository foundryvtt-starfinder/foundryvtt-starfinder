      "value": "<p>This sensor is worn as an adjustable viewer resting over the eyes, like goggles or thick glasses. It sends out X-rays and interprets the information gathered as an image it imposes over your normal vision. This grants sense through (vision), though it is blocked by materials one-fifth as dense as those that block normal sense through (2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal) and limits you to black-and-white vision while in use. You don't gain the benefit of any other special visual senses (such as low-light vision) while the visor is active, and you can't attempt sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet. Activating or deactivating the sensor is a move action.</p>",
