      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl00_LabelName\">A <em>charge cloak</em> can power devices that depend on electrical charges as if it were a battery. The cloak produces 4 charges each day, but they must be used as a single unit. Thus you could power a single attack from a yellow star plasma sword, which has a usage of 4, but you could also make only a single attack with a sub zero pistol, which has a usage of 1. The item must be one which uses charges or a battery, rather than petrol, rockets, rounds, or other forms of ammunition or power. You must be wearing or touching the item to be charged. You cannot use this item to recharge a battery or item; it can only be used to directly power an item for a single usage.&nbsp;</span></p>",
