When the grenade detonates, roll d% on the following table to determine the effect. (The GM is free to make up a similar effect based on your surroundings and circumstances.) If any effect of the grenade allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + your key ability score modifier.<br>These grenades pose a risk to the thrower. If you roll a 1, 3, or 5 on the attack roll, when the grenade lands but before it goes off, you teleport into the nearest open space in the blast radius. If no such space exists, you don’t teleport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 548px; text-align: center; border-width: thin; border-color: black; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; height: 2718px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<th style=\"border-left: thin solid black; background-color: #82f5de; width: 52px;\">D%</th>\n<th style=\"border-left: thin solid black; background-color: #82f5de; width: 489px;\">WONDER EFFECT</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">1–5</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius switches positions with another randomly determined creature in the blast radius (no save).

Some of these arms lack anatomy consistent with their host. Only two are useful, like a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha}’s extra arms.

The beast appears in an unoccupied space, only 1 square of which must be in the blast radius. If the beast doesn’t have enough room to appear, a beast of the next smaller size appears. The beast is no one’s ally. It has a 25% chance to arrive hostile, but is otherwise indifferent until it reacts to the current situation. Use the summoning creatures rules (Alien Archive 244) to determine the creature’s statistics.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">56–60</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius can hear the surface thoughts of other creatures within 30 feet of it as a bewildering jumble alongside its own. This mind-affecting effect renders a creature shaken. A creature can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw by 5 or more, that creature is no longer shaken and can focus the effect to function as detect thoughts, lasting for the remainder of the effect’s duration.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">61–65</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Will saving throw or suffer the mind-affecting delusion that it has increased one step in size. An affected creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Dexterity-based checks and saving throws, as well as to EAC and KAC. It is treated as squeezing when a creature of its imagined size would be squeezing, and it is unlikely to attempt to move into areas “too small” for it. If a creature believes it is constrained completely, it becomes @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.NV4qXRDgb7zTNkW2]{Paralyzed}. This delusion lasts 2d4 rounds, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw once on any round when something happens that contradicts the false belief, such as being moved when it believes itself constrained.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">66–70</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">About 5,000 harmless, beautiful flying insects appear within the blast radius.

This horde makes the blast radius difficult terrain, and at the end of every round, that area expands by 5 feet.
