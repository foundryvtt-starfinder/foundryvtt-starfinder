      "value": "<p>When it detonates, a wonder grenade releases a locus of magical uncertainty, which explodes into a strange effect once it makes contact with reality. When the grenade detonates, roll d% on the following table to determine the effect. (The GM is free to make up a similar effect based on your surroundings and circumstances.) If any effect of the grenade allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + your key ability score modifier.<br>These grenades pose a risk to the thrower. If you roll a 1, 3, or 5 on the attack roll, when the grenade lands but before it goes off, you teleport into the nearest open space in the blast radius. If no such space exists, you don’t teleport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 548px; text-align: center; border-width: thin; border-color: black; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; height: 2718px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<th style=\"border-left: thin solid black; background-color: #82f5de; width: 52px;\">D%</th>\n<th style=\"border-left: thin solid black; background-color: #82f5de; width: 489px;\">WONDER EFFECT</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">1–5</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius switches positions with another randomly determined creature in the blast radius (no save).

These limbs remain for 4d6 hours, but can also be removed with remove affliction (DC 20).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">51–55</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">One First World beast is teleported into the blast radius. Roll d% to determine the beast: 1–15—Huge beast (such as an elephant); 16–50—Large beast (such as a rhino); 51–100—Tiny beast (such as a squirrel). The beast appears in an unoccupied space, only 1 square of which must be in the blast radius. If the beast doesn’t have enough room to appear, a beast of the next smaller size appears. The beast is no one’s ally. It has a 25% chance to arrive hostile, but is otherwise indifferent until it reacts to the current situation. Use the summoning creatures rules (Alien Archive 244) to determine the creature’s statistics.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">56–60</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius can hear the surface thoughts of other creatures within 30 feet of it as a bewildering jumble alongside its own. This mind-affecting effect renders a creature shaken. A creature can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw by 5 or more, that creature is no longer shaken and can focus the effect to function as detect thoughts, lasting for the remainder of the effect’s duration.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">61–65</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Will saving throw or suffer the mind-affecting delusion that it has increased one step in size. An affected creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Dexterity-based checks and saving throws, as well as to EAC and KAC. It is treated as squeezing when a creature of its imagined size would be squeezing, and it is unlikely to attempt to move into areas “too small” for it. If a creature believes it is constrained completely, it becomes paralyzed. This delusion lasts 2d4 rounds, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw once on any round when something happens that contradicts the false belief, such as being moved when it believes itself constrained.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">66–70</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">About 5,000 harmless, beautiful flying insects appear within the blast radius.

Creatures in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dragged to the enarest space adjacent to the grenade's point of detonation. Any creature that collides with terrain that blocks line of effect or with another creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">76–80</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">The grenade splits into 1d3+1 grenades, each of a kind determined randomly by rolling d%: 1–20—frag II, 21–34—screamer II, 35–50— shock II, 51–70—stickybomb II, 71–80—cryo I, 81–90—flash II, 91–100—incendiary II.

This horde makes the blast radius difficult terrain, and at the end of every round, that area expands by 5 feet. Any item dropped or thrown into the area is knocked 1d4 squares in a random direction by the scrambling creatures, and knocked again when the area expands. The horde expands enough to disperse after 5 rounds.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">86–90</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">For 4d4 rounds, the blast radius fills with a windstorm (Core Rulebook 400).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 41.2188px;\">91–95</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 0.4em; border-left: thin solid black; width: 478.219px;\">Each creature in the blast radius changes color to a random neon hue (no save). Roll 1d6: 1 red, 2 orange, 3 yellow, 4 green, 5 blue, or 6 violet.

Air outside the vacuum rushes in to fill it after 4d4 minutes, unless the vacuum completely fills a sealed area, in which case it remains a vacuum even after 4d4 minutes have passed until the area is unsealed.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
