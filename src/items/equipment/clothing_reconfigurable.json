Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconfigurable clothing is constructed of specialized nanofibers that allow the clothing to shift between one or more outfits at your signal, such as clicking your heels together, speaking a command word, or twirling in place. As a move action, you can change your clothing from its current configuration to another outfit incorporated into the clothes. When you purchase reconfigurable clothing, choose one or more outfits to incorporate into your clothes. A single outfit of reconfigurable clothing can hold up to five other outfits of clothing. The cost for an outfit of reconfigurable clothing is 100 credits plus the cost of all outfits incorporated into the clothing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;100 + cost of component outfits</strong></p>"
