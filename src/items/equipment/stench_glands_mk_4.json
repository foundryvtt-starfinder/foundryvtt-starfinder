As a standard action a number of times per day equal to your stench glands’ mark, you can activate the necrograft to form a 10-foot radius cloud of stench centered on you that persists for 1 minute. Living creatures that enter your cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.ZacF0l6IwqBwToTJ]{sickened} until they leave the cloud and for [[/r 1d4 + 1]]{1d4+1} rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at this save is unaffected by your stench for 24 hours. Creatures that do not breathe or use self-contained breathing are unaffected by your stench. You can halt the stench as a swift action.</p>\n<p>Mk 4 and mk 5 stench glands produce a particularly loathsome funk that can drive off most creatures. After the first round of being sickened by your stench, a creature in your cloud must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw or become @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.LoRydw1D4bqlbkA2]{nauseated} until it leaves your cloud, after which it is sickened for [[/r 1d6 + 2]]{1d6+2} rounds. A creature that succeeds at this second Fortitude save remains sickened as normal, but it must continue to attempt a Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated each round it remains in your cloud.</p>"
