      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">A weapon with the <em>dispelling </em>fusion gathers spare wisps of latent magic during combat, which it can then unleash in a focused effort to dispel magic. The weapon gains dispelling as a critical hit effect in combat. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, so you must be in combat and facing a significant enemy (see page 242) for it to gain this critical hit effect. If there’s any doubt about whether you’re in combat or able to access the critical hit effect, the GM decides. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted <em>dispel magic</em>, as the spell, using the weapon’s item level as the dispel check’s caster level.&nbsp;</span></p>",
