      "value": "<p>This purplish-black cube, about 4 inches on each side, is based on the data cores of protocite speakers. It can store information and protect it from punishment and erasure. A data core is tough (AC 11, hardness 35, 55 HP) and can hold as much information as a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://aonsrd.com/ComputerMods.aspx?ItemName=Large&amp;Family=Secure%20Data\">computer&rsquo;s large secure-data module</a>. The core doesn&rsquo;t require energy, but another computer must be used to write to the drive or read it. Once you write data to the data core, it can only be read or, with a successful DC 19 Computers or Engineering check, erased. Erasing data renders that core section unmodifiable, so the core can hold less and less information the more that is erased from it.</p>",
