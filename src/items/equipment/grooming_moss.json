      "value": "<p>Grooming moss is a consumable, palm-sized organic patch you can apply to your skin as a standard action. When you do, it consumes dirt and byproducts from your skin, slowly working its way over your entire body to make your skin clean and healthy. You can use a move action to tear off a patch of grooming moss, but it falls off naturally after 12 hours. As long as it is attached to your bare skin, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against contact afflictions. Each breed of moss is meant to be used by a single group of physiologically similar species, such as lashunta and humans; when used on a different group of similar species, the moss still attaches to the skin for 12 hours, slowly working its way across the body, but the only result is itching and discomfort.</p>"
