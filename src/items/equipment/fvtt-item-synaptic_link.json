      "value": "<p>These heavy headbands resemble woven insect chitin and always come in pairs. Each headband has a capacity of 100 and uses 5 charges per round. When you and another creature wear and activate the headband, you both benefit from a psychic communion that transmits information about danger between you instantaneously as long as you are within 60 feet of each other. While connected in this way, both wearers gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative and Perception checks. If one wearer is aware of a combatant, the other wearer is also aware of it, and a wearer cannot be surprised unless the other wearer is also surprised. If one wearer succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve an illusion effect, the other wearer also disbelieves that effect. This link does not otherwise allow thoughts or communication to be shared.<br /><br />You can wear only one synaptic link at a time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>100;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>5/round</p>",
