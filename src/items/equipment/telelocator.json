      "value": "<p>A telelocator is a hybrid scanner that you can hold in one hand and activate as a move action if you have limited telepathy or telepathy. Each round, you use a move action to combine your telepathic ability with the scanner. The scanner operates by using @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.RVk6hgUCq3SDfeCb]{Blindsense} (thought) with a range equal to the range of your limited telepathy or telepathy, as well as@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.o5FtLBDT0f0zig3C]{Sense Through} (thought) at half that range. Targets appear on the scanner showing their distance and direction from you. A telelocator works on an internal energy source that can power it for 10 minutes per day. Each use, no matter how short, consumes 1 minute of this time. However, a creature that has limited telepathy or telepathy can spend 1 Resolve Point to use personal psychic power to fully recharge the telelocator. The psychic link created by using a given telelocator prevents you from using a different one for 24 hours.</p>"
