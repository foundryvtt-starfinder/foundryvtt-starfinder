      "value": "<p>Mirrored shards of glass are sewn into the cloth of this long overcoat at regular intervals. Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the shards to jut outward at deadly angles for 1 minute. During that time, each time you are struck with a creature’s natural weapon or unarmed strike, that creature takes 2d6 slashing damage. The creature can attempt a Reflex saving throw or half damage. In addition, once per day, if you are struck with a critical hit from a creature’s natural weapon or unarmed strike, you can cause the shards to fly from the coat as a reaction, dealing 8d6 slashing damage to every creature in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex save half). The DC for either Reflex save is equal to 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier. After doing so, you can’t use the coat’s other protective ability for 24 hours.</p>",
