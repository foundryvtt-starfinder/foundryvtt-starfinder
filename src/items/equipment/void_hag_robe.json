In either case, you can treat the robe as a worn magic item. If you do so, you can use the void hag’s stardust robes special ability. Once you use a given void hag robe, you can’t use another void hag robe for 24 hours. However, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to use the robe’s powers again during the same day, up to a maximum of three times per day.</p>\n<p>The robes aboard the Crucible are cursed. If you use the robes as a worn magic item, you are affected as if you are inside a planar barrier. You can still travel to another plane in a larger vehicle, such as a starship entering @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, but you can’t travel the planes bodily. The hags on the Crucible placed this curse knowing it would preclude the bearers of their robes from using spells such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.yjClpQv6CCrRE4EC]{Plane Shift} to easily escape the PCs, whose attack the hags foresaw in visions.</p>\n<h3>Stardust Robes (Su)</h3>\n<p>Three times per day as a standard action, a void hag can release the energies of the cosmos stored within her robes. Creatures within 30 feet of the void hag each take 2d6+10 force damage and are outlined in glowing motes of stellar energy for 2d4 rounds. An outlined creature takes a -20 penalty to Stealth checks and doesn’t benefit from the concealment normally provided by @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.kcIcN01XehzRe4Ui]{Displacement}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.YDXegEus8p0BnsH1]{Invisibility}, or similar effects. A target that succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex saving throw halves this damage and negates the outlining effect. Other void hags are immune to this ability.</p>"
