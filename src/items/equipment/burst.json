The weapon gains the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Arc} critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Arc} effect. The amount of damage dealt to the secondary target is equal to one-third the level of the weapon with the <em>burst</em> fusion (minimum 1). Only weapons that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage can benefit from a <em>burst</em> fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you select one of those types for the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.Item.O5GDQUKPCJ9Zbnfj]{Arc} critical hit effect to apply to secondary targets when the fusion is added.</p>"
