A common sensor is the radiation sweeper, a handheld device capable of detecting radiation within 120 feet. The sweeper emits warning pings in different tones to indicate the presence of low, medium, high, or severe radiation and displays the areas of radiation on a screen at the top of the device. You must take a move action each round to use the radiation sweeper. A radiation sweeper cannot detect radiation through 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field.</p>"
