A suspension pill ensures that whether you’ve contracted radiation sickness, been exposed to an unknown plague on a remote planet, or accidentally pricked yourself with a lethal toxin, help is never more than a Drift away. Individuals who have consumed a suspension pill should be taken to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station} or another world within their present planetary system for immediate medical treatment.</p>\n<p>A character can consume a suspension pill by taking a move action; alternatively, another character can take a standard action to feed a suspension pill to an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} or willing character. The suspension pill places the character in a coma-like state for a period of one week, during which the character is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} and requires no food or water. During this time, any @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} affecting the character don’t progress, and the character doesn’t attempt saving throws for them; the affliction remains at whatever state it was in for the duration of the pill’s effect, then resumes when the pill wears off.</p>\n<p>Once a suspension pill wears off, the character is immune to the effects of suspension pills for one week.</p>"
