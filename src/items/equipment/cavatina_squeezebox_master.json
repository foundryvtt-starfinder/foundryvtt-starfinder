If you succeed at a DC 17 Profession (musician) check when you play the squeezebox, you and all allies within 60 feet who can hear the music gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against fear effects until the beginning of your next turn. You can continue to play the squeezebox and grant this bonus as a move action each subsequent round without needing to attempt the skill check again. However, if you stop playing for even 1 round, you must succeed at the skill check again to grant the bonus again. This is a sense-dependent effect.</p>"
