One round after failing a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, or if the effect has any partial effect even with a successful save, you can attempt a new save against the same DC (this takes no action). If you succeed, the effect is removed entirely. If the mind-affecting effect already allows a second saving throw, you receive only one additional saving throw on the following round.</p>"
