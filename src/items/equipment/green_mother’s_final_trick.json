You wear the band around exposed flesh on an arm, neck, leg, or tail where its sharp thorns painlessly prick into the skin.</p>\n<p>While wearing afinal trick,you gain a +4 resistance bonus to saving throws against poison. If you successfully save against a poison, as a reaction you can absorb the poison into thefinal trick. As a standard action, you can deliver the poison with a touch, requiring a successful attack against an unwilling target’s EAC. Alternatively, you can deliver the poison as a reaction when you successfully damage a creature with a melee unarmed strike. The saving throw DC to resist the absorbed poison uses the poison’s original save DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your level + your Constitution modifier,whichever is lower. The final trick can store only one poison at a time, and the stored poison loses its potency and becomes useless if not used within 1 minute.</p>"
