After the ghibranis devastated their world with nuclear war, some of the survivors fended for themselves in the wastes, while the rest lived comfortably in a city protected by a bubble of force. The lingering radiation (even within the city) caused a rapid change in their biology, leading to two subspecies: husks, who have lost the use of their wings, and membranes, who have grown idle in their luxury.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis are Medium humanoids with the ghibrani subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.M3CbZjuqDmp7SjLr]{Affable}</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis receive a +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy skill checks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.3uLQiM92Tk7hoaDm]{Ghibrani Movement}</h2>\n<p>All ghibranis have a land speed of 30 feet.
