After the ghibranis devastated their world with nuclear war, some of the survivors fended for themselves in the wastes, while the rest lived comfortably in a city protected by a bubble of force. The lingering radiation (even within the city) caused a rapid change in their biology, leading to two subspecies: husks, who have lost the use of their wings, and membranes, who have grown idle in their luxury.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis are Medium humanoids with the ghibrani subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Affable</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis receive a +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy skill checks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ghibrani Movement</h2>\n<p>All ghibranis have a land speed of 30 feet. Husk ghibranis have a climb speed of 20 feet, while membranes have an extraordinary fly speed of 20 feet with average maneuverability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Distracting Buzz</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, a membrane ghibrani can vibrate her wings fast enough to produce an almost imperceptible hum. All creatures within 15 feet of the membrane ghibrani that hear this buzz must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ghibrani&rsquo;s character level or CR + her Wisdom modifier) or gain the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.yUtkoIshf4dPruNd]{Off-Target} condition for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent} ability. The membrane ghibrani can&rsquo;t use her wings to fly in the same round in which she uses this ability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis can see twice as far as @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Humans} in conditions of dim light.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sturdy</h2>\n<p>Husk ghibranis receive a +2 racial bonus to KAC against attempts to bull rush or reposition them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Subspecies</h2>\n<p>Ghibranis belong to one of two subspecies: husk or membrane. All ghibranis start with +2 Wisdom at character creation. Husk ghibranis are more hardy (+2 Constitution) but less imaginative (&ndash;2 Intelligence). Membrane ghibranis are more nimble (+2 Dexterity) but weaker (&ndash;2 Strength).</p>",
