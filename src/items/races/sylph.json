They can also arise in areas that have strong influences from the Plane of Air. Though sylphs can pass for other kinds of humanoids, they tend to be slender, and all have complex blue markings swirling across their skin. Sylphs are naturally reserved and they avoid attention.<br><br><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Dex, +2 Int, –2 Con<br><strong>Hit Points</strong> 2</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Sylphs are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Air Affinity</h2>\n<p>Sylphs have a +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks and, if able to fly, maneuverability one step better than normal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Sylphs have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Electricity Resistance</h2>\n<p>Sylphs have electricity resistance 5.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell-Like Ability</h2>\n<p>Once per day, a sylph can use flight (1st level) on herself as a spell-like ability.
