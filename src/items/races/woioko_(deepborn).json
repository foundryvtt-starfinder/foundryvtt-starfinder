      "value": "<p>Inhabitants of the ocean planet Heicoron IV (<em>Starfinder Adventure Path #1</em>62), woiokos are humanoids who have smooth, eellike skin. They evolved from underwater-dwelling ancestors, but more recently they split into two subspecies when rising sea levels destroyed their terrestrial civilization. The air-breathing Floatborn remained above the waves and now reside in vast floating arcologies divided into dozens of autonomous nations. The Deepborn genetically modified themselves to breathe water as well as air and returned to their primeval homes deep in the ocean, where short-lived domains constantly vie for dominance. The two subspecies have little contact with one another, each remaining in its preferred environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong>+2 Cha, +2 Str, -2 Con (Deepborn) or +2 Cha, +2 Dex, -2 Con (Floatborn)</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Woiokos are Medium humanoids with the woioko subtype.
