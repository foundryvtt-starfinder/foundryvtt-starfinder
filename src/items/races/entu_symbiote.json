      "value": "<p>Entu colonies begin their life cycle as a collection of minuscule&nbsp;spores. Over time, the spores fuse together through intricate&nbsp;networks of mycelia that function similarly to neurons, creating&nbsp;sapient and mobile fungal colonies. These structures generate&nbsp;conscious thought and obtain sensory information about the&nbsp;colony&rsquo;s environment.</p>\n<p>In their first weeks of life, entu spores gradually coalesce into amorphous pools of opalescent slime with malleable pseudopodâ€‘like organs. At this stage, colonies can communicate&nbsp;telepathically with other creatures using a lexicon of sensory and&nbsp;emotional concepts. Entu colonies can reproduce asexually once&nbsp;they reach maturity, typically six months after they first sprout&nbsp;mycelia. Most of the resulting spores integrate into the parent&nbsp;colony, but some may split off to form a separate colony.</p>\n<p>Thought not parasitic, entu colonies feed on emotion and&nbsp;thought. In fact, some seek to consensually merge with other&nbsp;sentient creatures rather than form into full-fledged and&nbsp;independent colonies. Instead of harming their host, an entu&nbsp;fungus&rsquo;s adaptable cells mimic the host&rsquo;s brain and nerve tissue.&nbsp;Their mycelia intertwine with their host&rsquo;s central nervous&nbsp;system, creating new synapses and enhancing sections of the&nbsp;host&rsquo;s brain. Despite inhabiting the host&rsquo;s body, the entu fungus&nbsp;retains a separate consciousness which intertwines with its host&nbsp;through shared functional memories and sensory input. The&nbsp;resultant symbiotic life-form, called an entu symbiote, eventually&nbsp;attains self-awareness, complex thought, and even linguistic&nbsp;ability. Entu integration can sometimes result in entu symbiotes&rsquo;&nbsp;offspring already being seeded with the fungal life integrated&nbsp;into their bodies and brains; this development has led to the&nbsp;&ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; of entire species of previously non-sapient animals.</p>\n<p>The nelentu, one of the founding species of the Kreiholm&nbsp;Freehold, is a prominent example of a successful symbiosis&nbsp;that spans generations. Originally a species of bat-like&nbsp;animals called neleks that evolved on Agillae-2, these once&nbsp;unintelligent, fruit-eating creatures encountered entu spores&nbsp;early in their evolution and willingly became their&nbsp;hosts. The two species formed&nbsp;a society based on this&nbsp;symbiosis. Today, nelentus&nbsp;inhabit tiered jungle-cities&nbsp;built around green spaces,&nbsp;known as Gardens of Thought,&nbsp;where they cultivate entu spores for&nbsp;future generations. Nelentus&nbsp;consider themselves to&nbsp;be one species, referring&nbsp;to themselves and other&nbsp;nelentus using plural pronouns&nbsp;in deference to their dual nature.</p>\n<p>Entu fungi of all kinds seek&nbsp;constant exposure to emotion&nbsp;and thought to thrive, and&nbsp;those involved with symbiotes&nbsp;prioritize their hosts&rsquo; physical&nbsp;needs. They prefer to enter&nbsp;symbiotic relationships with&nbsp;creatures who can benefit from&nbsp;their cellular mimicry, living as long&nbsp;as the host creature does&mdash;and @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4MxAK5uS0zMNWhUK]{Dying}&nbsp;along with it. Entu colonies, on the&nbsp;other hand, can survive for up&nbsp;to 300 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong>: +2 Int</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong> Varies by animal<br /><strong>Average Weight</strong> Varies by animal<br /><strong>Age of Maturity</strong> 5 years<br /><strong>Maximum Age</strong> 30 + 1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Entu symbiotes are Small, Medium, or Large animals with the entu symbiote subtype.</p>\n<h2>Entu Symbiote Senses</h2>\n<p>An entu symbiote has blindsense (emotion) with a range of 30 feet and low-light vision.</p>\n<h2>Extrasensory Perception</h2>\n<p>The mycelia integrated into an entu symbiote&rsquo;s nervous system allow them to perceive ambient thoughts and emotion.
