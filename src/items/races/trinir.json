These small, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}-like beaked humanoids lack a history, as they awakened in hibernation chambers only recently as their planet thawed. Thanks to the Gap (and possibly other unknown factors), trinirs have found little to indicate who they are or how they came to be.
