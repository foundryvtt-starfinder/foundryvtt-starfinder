These small, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}-like beaked humanoids lack a history, as they awakened in hibernation chambers only recently as their planet thawed. Thanks to the Gap (and possibly other unknown factors), trinirs have found little to indicate who they are or how they came to be. Some believe ruins of their ancient civilization might be found somewhere within the ice.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong>+2 Con, +2 Int, –2 Cha</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Trinirs are Small humanoids with the trinir subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.2GfIHAWAuRMw6BVL]{Biotech Organism}</h2>\n<p>For effects targeting creatures by type, trinirs count as both humanoids and constructs (whichever effect is worse).
