Kaa-lekis are tripodal humanoids with patches of blue-green moss that grow naturally on their skin; these dense clumps luminesce involuntarily (but faintly) when the kaa-leki experiences strong emotions. The kaa-leki home world is the corpse of a titanic organic crystalline creature called @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.KICH9Mu0E2lfxY9h]{Hawanna} (see page 62), but their legends claim they originated elsewhere. Kaa-lekis have learned to handle the strange and hostile crystal constructs that roam Hawanna&rsquo;s surface, but the true history of the constructs is lost to the Gap.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Kaa-leki society centers around small, semi-nomadic family groups and extended kin networks. The role of each family member is passed on through generations, though some may be given a different task if they show an affinity for it. One of the most important of these roles is that of &ldquo;reaper.&rdquo; Reapers venture into the crystal caverns of Hawanna to harvest the crystals used to craft the sonic weapons that are the bulk of their world&rsquo;s exports. This usually puts the reapers in the path of Hawanna&rsquo;s roaming constructs, making it a dangerous job for only the bravest kaa-lekis. To increase their chance of survival, reapers must undergo months of intensive training before being allowed to undertake such missions. <br /><br /><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Kaa-lekis are Medium humanoids with the kaa-leki and plantlike subtypes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.ozy0QflcHh2fippf]{Evaluate Construct}</h2>\n<p>As a move action, a kaa-leki can attempt a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} check against a construct it can see (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the construct&rsquo;s CR).
