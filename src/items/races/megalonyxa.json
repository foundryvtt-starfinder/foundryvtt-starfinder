There, they contemplated the stars as a mostly sedentary species, and were able to build a thriving civilization through the use of magic. Spaceflight eluded them, however. As such, when extraplanetary visitors arrived, they found a highly evolved society eager to take to the stars. Within a few decades, all megalonyxas left Karnoq, consigning their cities and other settlements to the wastes of history. Explorers from other worlds can learn much from these remains if they can withstand the planet&rsquo;s crushing gravity.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">A typical megalonyxa stands about 10 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Int, &ndash;2 Dex<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Megalonyxas are Large monstrous humanoids with a space and reach of 10 feet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Megalonyxas have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Efficient Sabotage</h2>\n<p>Once per day when attempting an Engineering check to disable a device, a megaloynxa can roll 1d6 and add the result of the roll as an insight bonus to the check.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">High Grav Worlder</h2>\n<p>Megalonyxas gain Heavy Weapon Proficiency without having to meet the prerequisites.
