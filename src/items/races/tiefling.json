      "value": "<p>Many kinds of extraplanar beings can infuse humanoids’ bloodlines, whether as a side effect of powerful magic or the result of a tryst; those in whom extraplanar traits surface strongly are known as planar scions. Aasimars and tieflings, the mortal offspring of celestials and fiends, respectively, are the most common of these. Though planar scions resemble their humanoid kin, their appearance and demeanor bear supernatural touches. Tieflings might have horns, vestigial wings, or cloven hooves, while aasimars may have glowing eyes or a metallic sheen to their hair and skin.</p>\n<p>Because of their innate curiosity, humans are more likely to dally with outsiders, and as a consequence, a significant percentage of planar scions living in the Pact Worlds are descended from humans. However, because humans are far less populous than in pre-Gap eras, planar scions descended from other humanoid races are now far more numerous. A planar scion might pass for a member of the humanoid parent’s species, or the scion’s otherworldly features could make their origin obvious to those who are familiar with the species’ normal characteristics. Those whose outsider blood is evident still find acceptance in most major settlements across the Pact Worlds, where diverse beings coexist in peace. On @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.hepqXl6gFvs5sDQu]{Absalom Station}, the hub of interspecies relations, few people bat an eye when they meet an aasimar or tiefling.</p>\n<p>However, in insular or tradition-bound communities, any signs of plane-touched heritage can be a blessing—or a death sentence—depending on the dominant traditions. The demon-worshiping @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.races.3kLK4WKPqNvFTwIB]{Drow} of @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.psZBx1kcx9pHsLrz]{Apostae} see tieflings as a favor from demonic patrons, while the elves of Sovyrian on @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel} are likely to banish children who bear such fiendish heritage. The Radiant Cathedral, on the other hand, trains aasimars to become beacons of the Sarenite faith, and also guides tieflings to a brighter future than their heritage suggests. Formians, shobhads, vesk, and other species with flexible morality view aasimars and tieflings, particularly those descended from their own kind, with both admiration and suspicion.</p>\n<p>Planar scions are often outliers in their community, either put on a pedestal or ostracized because of their ancestry. The potent blood that courses through the veins of aasimars and tieflings also makes them ambitious; many choose a dangerous but rewarding profession, such as explorer, mercenary, spy, or pilot.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong>+2 Dex, +2 Int, –2 Cha</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height</strong>&nbsp;5–7 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight</strong>&nbsp;100–300 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity</strong>&nbsp;18 years</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age</strong>&nbsp;80+2d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Planar scions are often Medium, and all are outsiders with the native subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.HhrIJeHTxSGVX9mV]{Darkvision}</h2>\n<p>Aasimars and tieflings have darkvision to a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.0Pcm0XeDIMI0C1jK]{Deceitful}</h2>\n<p>Tieflings gain a +2 species bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.GcVVfpQ79HdcMqBt]{Bluff} and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.5h3iePfJaeQMc3Qr]{Stealth} checks.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.ICBjLsdFY0avOwCK]{Fiendish Gloom}</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, the tiefling causes light within 20 feet of her to decrease one step. This gloom lasts for up to 1 minute, but the tiefling can dismiss it as a swift action. Nonmagical light sources can’t increase the light level in this area. Magical light can increase the light level in this area only if it’s from an item or creature of a level or CR higher than that of the tiefling. A tiefling can use this ability once per day, plus a number of times equal to half her CR or level.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.sM8KLNy9c7lenEkC]{Fiendish Resistance}</h2>\n<p>Tieflings have resistance 5 to cold, electricity, and fire.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Species Traits</h1>\n<p>The following are alternate species traits for planar scions.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.STG0VDqk8bTAbJjm]{Fiendish Inferno}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 52</p>\n<p>Many tieflings born of Hell’s fiery depths can call forth flames to sear their foes. The tiefling can cast @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.a2zXJ84rzkD8SIBe]{Overheat} as a spell-like ability. At 11th level, the scion can instead cast @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.spells.WP0QPu6QvApGaQIG]{Explosive Blast} as a spell-like ability. The scion can invoke hellfire this way once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces deceitful and fiendish gloom.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.tOQ6ppFm7fuYjTvU]{Fiendish Nihilism}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 52</p>\n<p>The nightmare of Abaddon often forms tieflings who are natural life-stealers. As a swift action, these tieflings can devour the fleeting life force of a creature within 30 feet that was killed since the end of the tiefling’s last turn. Doing so grants the tiefling temporary Hit Points equal to the killed creature’s CR and a +1 divine bonus to saving throws, which last for 1 minute or until they use this ability again. The tiefling can devour life force in this way once per day, plus a number of times equal to half their CR or level.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces deceitful and fiendish gloom.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.NsHvaIAD0UQmpEoC]{Fiendish Ruin}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 52</p>\n<p>The roiling tumult of the Abyss creates tieflings cursed—or blessed—with the ability to enter frenzies of destructive activity. As a swift action, the tiefling can enter a frenzy, which lasts for 1 minute. During this time, the tiefling takes a –2 penalty to AC and a –1 penalty to all saving throws, but gains a +1 divine bonus to attack rolls and a +2 divine bonus to melee damage rolls. The tiefling can frenzy this way once per day, plus a number of times equal to half their CR or level.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces deceitful and fiendish gloom.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.7TXDXrPIEhs8gldz]{Fiendish Torment}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 52</p>\n<p>Tieflings who trace their lineage to the Shadow Plane’s velstracs can conjure lengths of chain to bind foes. As a standard action, the tiefling chooses a foe within 30 feet and attempts a combat maneuver check to grapple, using their highest ability modifier in place of their Strength modifier. The tiefling does not gain the grappled condition this way. In subsequent rounds, the tiefling can spend a move action each round to command the chains to continue grappling, potentially pinning the target as normal. Each use of these binding chains lasts 1 minute, until the scion uses this ability again or dismisses the chains as a swift action. The tiefling can conjure binding chains this way once per day, plus a number of times equal to half their CR or level.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces deceitful and fiendish gloom.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.ZB9diCMqimFfwR25]{Myopic Resilience}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> AP #46 pg. 53</p>\n<p>Some planar scions build a particularly intense resistance rather than developing diverse resistances; tieflings of infernal lineage often possess superb fire resistance, for example. When selecting this trait, the planar scion chooses a single energy type to which they normally have resistance, such as cold, electricity, or fire. The scion loses resistance to the other energy types, but the resistance they choose increases to 10 at 8th level and to 15 at 12th level.</p>\n<p><strong>This ability alters celestial resistance for aasimars, distortion resistance for ganzis, or fiendish resistance for tieflings.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.0oQnLsoXNVkdIPfs]{Prehensile Tail}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 53</p>\n<p>A planar scion with this alternate species trait has a long, dexterous, fully prehensile tail (or similar appendage, such as a tentacle or prehensile hair). This appendage enables them to wield and hold up to three hands’ worth of weapons and equipment. While their appendage increases the number of items they can have at the ready, it doesn’t increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces observant for ganzi or deceitful for tieflings.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.1nYYgRMf1o4973cB]{Winged Scion}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong> AP #46 pg. 53</p>\n<p>A planar scion with this alternate species trait has a pair of fully developed wings sprouting from their back. Aasimars with angel wings and tieflings with bat wings are the most iconic, but by no means are these the only manifestations. A planar scion with this trait has an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces celestial radiance for aasimars or fiendish gloom for tieflings.</strong></p>"
