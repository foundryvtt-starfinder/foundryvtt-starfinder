They have sharp-toothed mandibles and smooth, hairless heads. Kish skin color ranges from gray to sky blue, with gradations in hue across their bodies. There is little variation between kish genders, though kish can easily tell males from females by subtle differences in the shape of the central eye.</p>\n<p>Kish tend to congregate into tribes that are led by either the strongest or the wisest of their number.
