Sulis are difficult to recognize by sight, since they resemble ordinary humanoids with, perhaps, an occasional flash of elemental light in their eyes. Most manifest their otherworldly heritage at adolescence. Strong of body and personality, sulis readily survive and assimilate, making them one of the most widespread planar scions.<br /><br /><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Str, +2 Cha, &ndash;2 Int<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Sulis are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.HhrIJeHTxSGVX9mV]{Darkvision}</h2>\n<p>Sulis have low-light vision.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.Xj51QXKB8KMqYJeV]{Elemental Assault}</h2>\n<p>As a swift action, a suli can cause half the damage dealt by a weapon she wields to be acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage for 1 round.
