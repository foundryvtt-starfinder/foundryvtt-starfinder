Oreads usually have skin of a dark neutral tone, and some have features that appear to be made of stone, crystal, or packed earth.

Oreads with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} checks to balance across narrow ledges, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.iLlBAZBfHJMZQRQx]{Athletics} checks to climb stony inclines, and Fortitude saves to prevent being fatigued by thin @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.NOrSFYXShdxot60k]{Atmospheres} due to altitude (Core Rulebook 397).</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces earth affinity.</strong></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.X6bpbuzxguajA7Yy]{Static Discharge}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> AP #46 pg. 53<br />Some oreads born of waterless sand planets can draw upon the friction of their desert worlds to channel their elemental opposite. An oread with this trait can cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.yFhvmdW0BnMHV3Sm]{Jolting Surge} once per day with a caster level equal to their level. At 8th level, they can use this ability one additional time per day; at 16th level, they gain a third use per day.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces an oread&rsquo;s spell-like ability.</strong></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.JWMBE2ja8VmCo5m6]{Warp Element}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong>AP #46 pg. 53<br />When a planar scion with this trait makes an attack or casts a spell that would deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, they can instead choose to match half of that damage to the element of their heritage (fire for ifrits, acid for oreads, electricity for sylphs, or cold for undines).</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces each planar scion&rsquo;s elemental affinity.</strong></p>"
