Oreads usually have skin of a dark neutral tone, and some have features that appear to be made of stone, crystal, or packed earth. Oreads are generally calm to the point of stoicism.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Str, +2 Wis, &ndash;2 Cha<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Oreads are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.ursgilW1UIpEd3vc]{Acid Resistance}</h2>\n<p>Oreads have acid resistance 5.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.HhrIJeHTxSGVX9mV]{Darkvision}</h2>\n<p>Oreads have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.12EB1YcNhJnwzIGh]{Earth Affinity}</h2>\n<p>Whenever an oread deals acid damage (including with spells such as <em>energy ray</em>), the oread can change it to bludgeoning damage instead.

An oread with this trait can cast @Compendium[sfrpg.spells.yFhvmdW0BnMHV3Sm]{Jolting Surge} once per day with a caster level equal to their level. At 8th level, they can use this ability one additional time per day; at 16th level, they gain a third use per day.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces an oread&rsquo;s spell-like ability.</strong></p>\n<h2>@Compendium[sfrpg.racial-features.JWMBE2ja8VmCo5m6]{Warp Element}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source&nbsp;</strong>AP #46 pg. 53<br />When a planar scion with this trait makes an attack or casts a spell that would deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, they can instead choose to match half of that damage to the element of their heritage (fire for ifrits, acid for oreads, electricity for sylphs, or cold for undines).</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces each planar scion&rsquo;s elemental affinity.</strong></p>"
