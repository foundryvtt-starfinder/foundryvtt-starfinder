Alkainan mythology speaks of their home world, a realm of naturally occurring metallic spires somewhere in the Vast, and how they fled a “great evil” that none can specify.</p>\n<p>Current alkainan society consists of three castes: the byggja, custodians of the Volunisp settlements; the leita, who take to the stars to meet and trade with other species; and the matriarchs, female alkainan leaders and ministers of marriage and other spiritual matters. While most matriarchs remain on Volunisp, a few travel with leita on their chrome-plated starships.</p>\n<p>Part of an alkainan's physiology depends on the types of metals consumed by their ancestors on their home world, granting unusual coloring to their fur and unique defenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong> +2 Str, +2 Con, –2 Wis</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p><h2>Size and Type</h2><p>Alkainans are Medium humanoids with the alkainan subtype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.ivfqMdylivscbLak]{Low-Light Vision}</h2><p>Alkainans have low-light vision.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.J0NXGFNv4msxyMWr]{Metallic Bloodline}</h2><p>Each alkainan's ancestors survived on a type of metal, granting their descendants a certain ability as follows.</p>\n<p><em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.bdfjLmAqNcoYrfTv]{Ferrous}:</em> When wearing armor, the alkainan gains a +1 species bonus to KAC.</p>\n<p><em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.KmbbqcLqnjDwylk6]{Nonferrous}:</em> The alkainan gains a +2 species bonus to Reflex saving throws.</p>\n<p><em>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.Item.wBBmNIKjcGAGnZE8]{Skymetal}:</em> The alkainan's unarmed strikes count as magic.
