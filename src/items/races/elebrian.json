Only a tiny population of living elebrians now remain.</p>\n<p>Elebrians are very humanlike, and it has been suggested that they and humanity may share a common ancestor in the ancient past. A typical elebrian stands slightly over 6 feet tall and has pale skin and large, dark eyes. They have oversized craniums with slightly distended foreheads to house their large brains. Most elebrians are entirely hairless, but a small minority grow wispy hair on their scalps and thin eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Elebrians have quick wits and a natural desire to accumulate both knowledge and power. They are driven to undertake tasks that provide either a valued insight or a significant personal advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong>+2 Con, +2 Int, -2 Wis</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 2</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Elebrians are Medium humanoids with the elebrian subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.i2kNZLmAceYBrcFc]{Find Weakness}</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can instinctively find and take advantage of other creaturesâ€™ weak points. An elebrian can make a single melee or ranged attack as a full action, and if she hits, she can add half her level to the damage dealt (minimum +1 damage). Whether successful or not, once an elebrian has used this ability on a creature, that creature is immune to it for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.4sC0S5Wf5oL62PjC]{Intellectual Knack}</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can easily comprehend complex issues and remember minutia. An elebrian can attempt a skill check to recall knowledge untrained, regardless of the DC, and can always take 20 to do so (though this takes 2 minutes), even without access to an information network or data set.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.ivfqMdylivscbLak]{Low-Light Vision}</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>"
