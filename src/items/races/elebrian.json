Only a tiny population of living elebrians now remain.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Elebrians are very humanlike, and it has been suggested that they and humanity may share a common ancestor in the ancient past. A typical elebrian stands slightly over 6 feet tall and has pale skin and large, dark eyes. They have oversized craniums with slightly distended foreheads to house their large brains. Most elebrians are entirely hairless, but a small minority grow wispy hair on their scalps and thin eyebrows.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">Elebrians have quick wits and a natural desire to accumulate both knowledge and power. They are driven to undertake tasks that provide either a valued insight or a significant personal advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Ability Adjustments </strong>+2 Con, +2 Int, -2 Wis<br /><strong>Hit Points</strong> 2</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Elebrians are Medium humanoids with the elebrian subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Find Weakness</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can instinctively find and take advantage of other creatures&rsquo; weak points. An elebrian can make a single melee or ranged attack as a full action, and if she hits, she can add half her level to the damage dealt (minimum +1 damage). Whether successful or not, once an elebrian has used this ability on a creature, that creature is immune to it for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Intellectual Knack</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can easily comprehend complex issues and remember minutia. An elebrian can attempt a skill check to recall knowledge untrained, regardless of the DC, and can always take 20 to do so (though this takes 2 minutes), even without access to an information network or data set.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>Elebrians can see in dim light as if it were normal light.</p>"
