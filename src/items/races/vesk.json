      "value": "<p>Heavily muscled and covered with thick scales and short, sharp horns, the reptilian vesk are exactly as predatory and warlike as they appear. Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds—for now.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>The lizard-like vesk stand close to 7 feet tall, are thick with muscle, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Though they’ve long since adopted technological weapons, they retain the thick claws and teeth of natural predators and enjoy using them to intimidate “softer” races. In addition, they also have long, powerful tails—while these are primarily used for balance, some vesk martial arts incorporate formidable tail slaps. Small horn spikes dot the skulls of both sexes, and protrude from their lower jaws in bony “beards” that sometimes extend down their spines to their tails. Female vesk are often larger than their male counterparts, and whereas males are various shades of green, females often have vibrant, mottled coloration that’s considered an indicator of both health and attractiveness.</p>\n<h3>Home World</h3>\n<p>Vesk first arose on a single world around their sun but quickly spread to the others, turning potential competitor races (as the vesk saw them) into vassals in the vast empire they call the Veskarium. Today, these other worlds officially no longer even have names, only numbers correlating to their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). The exception to this rule is Vesk Prime, vesk’s ancestral home, which remains the seat of their government and high society.</p>\n<h3>Society and Alignment</h3>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. While merchants and others with peaceful professions can advance economically, political power is the exclusive domain of those who’ve proven themselves in armed conflict. Surprisingly, this proof doesn’t need to come through military service, or even benefit the Veskarium. Many vesk attain similar elevation in social status through performing mercenary work, engaging in dueling, or providing security on exploration missions. Though obsessed with conquest, dominance, and social rank, vesk have an equally strong sense of honor and pride in fulfilling their agreements and treating subordinates of all races fairly. They are stoic and taciturn with strangers but capable of great bursts of emotion in private or in the heat of battle. Vesk society tends to be efficient, respectful, and law-abiding—especially since nearly any insult or violation of custom could trigger a brutally violent blood debt. Even outside of their home system, vesk are most often lawful, though usually according to their own code of honor rather than that of whatever society they happen to be in. They tend toward a neutral morality, though individuals can easily skew good or evil.</p>\n<h3>Relations</h3>\n<p>Vesk’s love of military conquest and empire building originally led to significant skirmishes between their star system and the nearby Pact Worlds, and the ensuing conflict—often called the Silent War—might have continued indefinitely had the Swarm not attacked both systems simultaneously. Banding together for mutual defense, vesk and Pact Worlds cultures successfully fought off the Swarm, forging a tentative peace in the process.</p>\n<p>Vesk respect honor, strength, and self-mastery. Though their relations with the races of the Pact Worlds remain strained due to the only barely averted war, they admire androids’ dispassionate consistency, kasathas’ sense of honor, and the strength of lashuntas in battle. However, they find ysoki weak and frivolous, and humans quick to break their agreements. Shirrens perplex vesk with their refusal to parlay their strengths, including their instinctive coordination in battle and willingness to die for their comrades, into an empire.</p>\n<h3>Adventurers</h3>\n<p>Vesk adventuring with races from other systems fall into two categories. The first are mercenaries or glory-seekers looking for a chance to engage in honorable combat and build up their prestige. The second are nonwarrior vesk who have rejected their home society for its obsession with combat and have chosen instead to seek opportunities among more open-minded races. Warrior vesk most often fit the soldier class, though a growing number have become intrigued by the path of the solarian. Noncombatant vesk often lean toward becoming mystics, though some overcome the traditional vesk culture’s dismissal of education to become mechanics or even technomancers.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Adjustments</strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points&nbsp;</strong> 6</p>\n<h2>Vital Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Average Height&nbsp;</strong> 6-8 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Average Weight&nbsp;</strong> 200-300 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Age of Maturity&nbsp;</strong> 16 years</p>\n<p><strong>Maximum Age&nbsp;</strong> 70+1d20 years</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Vesk are Medium humanoids with the vesk subtype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.AbAOlXlBL5lYzKnH]{Armor Savant}</h2>\n<p>Vesk use armor in a way that complements their uniquely sturdy physiology.

Vesk gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1–1/2 × their character level to their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).</p>\n<h1>Alternate Species Traits</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em></p>\n<p>Vesk adaptations vary from individual to individual, with many vesk training their bodies from a very young age to excel in particular ways. Other vesk are born with unusual physical traits that suggest some genetic exception. The following alternate species traits represent some of these changes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.P3NaY8yoWHOjDJNU]{Brawny}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS <em>pg. 135</em></p>\n<p>Many vesk take pride in being as physically fit as possible.

These individuals might take up careers working in facilities or vessels located underwater or in space. Vesk with this species trait can hold their breath for 10 times the normal duration, and they can begin to hold their breath as a purely defensive reaction whenever they are submerged underwater, enter a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.BWuAh3NeW0Dcnjon]{vacuum}, or would otherwise begin @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.SfkuzH5kxSAmG4nv.JournalEntryPage.n461i9lDXw303SiY#suffocation-and-drowning]{Suffocation and Drowning} or inhaling a substance they suspect to be harmful.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces armor savant.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.kGv6ghOHS9bGcXqQ]{Forceful Mind}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;NS <em>pg. 135</em></p>\n<p>Some vesk fight via means other than weapons. Once per day, when an opponent succeeds at a saving throw against a spell cast by a vesk with this trait, that vesk can force the opponent to reroll the saving throw with a –2 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces natural weapons.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.2IpAD2REUlJOwqz1]{Frilled}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> NS <em>&nbsp;pg. 135</em></p>\n<p>Some vesk have particularly elaborate bone spikes on their heads, giving them an especially fearsome appearance. These vesk gain a +2 species bonus to @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i]{Intimidate} checks.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces armor savant.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.fhsjtDU0gu23QLTZ]{Observant}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em></p>\n<p>Some vesk learn to watch their environment and other creatures around them for signs of danger. Vesk with this species trait select either @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.gZlg2ZKze0erNLmP]{Perception} or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.nBrYkGfNBJAHe0xJ]{Sense Motive}. They gain a +3 species bonus to checks with the chosen skill. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces fearless.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.IrCKdQw6GBGQtll3]{Prehensile Tail}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em></p>\n<p>Occasionally vesk are born with a tail that is thinner and significantly more flexible than the norm for their species. Though less common, there are also ancient vesk stretching and range of motion techniques an individual can use to alter the build of their tail over years of dedicated work. Vesk with this species trait have a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects, allowing them to wield and hold up to three hands’ worth of weapons and equipment. This does not increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces natural weapons.</strong></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.racial-features.gmZDk8tter0LVT4d]{Vesk Venom}</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>COM pg. 26</em></p>\n<p>Though most vesk are not venomous, a few have venom sacs and elongated teeth held over from a vesk subspecies that has since gone extinct, perhaps related to the snake-people of Vesk Prime. Other theories suggest these traits are from a time when an ancient vesk nation modified its warriors with magic or technology to gain venomous natural attacks.</p>\n<p>Vesk with this species trait can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with their unarmed strikes. When the vesk makes a successful unarmed strike that deals piercing damage, and the target takes damage from the attack, as a reaction the vesk can expose the target to venom. Once a vesk has used their venom, they can do so again only after taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. A vesk is immune to the effects of their own venom.</p>\n<p><strong>This replaces armor savant and fearless, and it modifies natural weapons.</strong></p>\n<h3>Vesk Venoms</h3>\n<p><strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poison (injury)};&nbsp;<strong>Save&nbsp;</strong> Fortitude (DC = 10 + half the vesk’s level + the vesk’s Constitution modifier)</p>\n<p><strong>Track&nbsp;</strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Dexterity (special)}&nbsp;<strong>Onset&nbsp;</strong> 1 round;&nbsp;<strong>Frequency&nbsp;</strong> 1/round for 6 rounds</p>\n<p><strong>Effect&nbsp;</strong> Progression track is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Healthy}—@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Sluggish}—@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Stiffened}—@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Staggered}; staggered is the end state.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure&nbsp;</strong> 1 save.
