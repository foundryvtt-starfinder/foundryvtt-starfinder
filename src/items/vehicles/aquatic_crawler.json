Such a vehicle is treated as a tall creature of the same size category for the purpose of determining the reach of its manipulators, and each manipulator can hold up to 10 &times; the vehicle&rsquo;s item level in bulk. Manipulators are generally too large and clumsy for delicate tasks such as operating equipment designed for Medium and smaller creatures.<br />A manipulator&rsquo;s EAC is equal to 4 + the vehicle&rsquo;s EAC and its KAC is equal to the 4 + the vehicle&rsquo;s KAC. It has Hit Points equal to 3 &times; the item level of the vehicle and hardness equal to half the vehicle&rsquo;s hardness. A manipulator that has lost at least half of its total Hit Points gains the broken condition, imposing a &ndash;2 penalty to Piloting checks to control the manipulator and to the DC of checks to escape the manipulator. Damage done to a vehicle&rsquo;s manipulator doesn&rsquo;t affect the vehicle&rsquo;s Hit Point total.</p>\n<p><br />A vehicle&rsquo;s pilot (or one of its complement) can control a manipulator in the following ways, though only one person can control a manipulator in a round.</p>\n<h5>Crush</h5>\n<p>As a standard action, you direct the manipulator to clamp tighter around a held creature or object (see Grab below), dealing half the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage. The creature or object can halve this damage by succeeding at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the vehicle item level).</p>\n<h5>Grab</h5>\n<p>As a standard action, you direct the manipulator to grab at a target within its reach by attempting a Piloting check (DC = 10 + the target&rsquo;s KAC). On a success, the target is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} by the manipulator. If the target is a creature, it gains soft cover and the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} condition while held by the manipulator. If the result of your Piloting check exceeded the DC by 5 or more, the creature is instead @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XgK4EdO5D3Fj3iWz]{Pinned}. A creature held by a manipulator can use the escape action to free itself by succeeding at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 + the vehicle&rsquo;s KAC), but it can&rsquo;t grapple the vehicle in return.<br />If the target of a successful grab is another vehicle, both vehicles are considered to be connected by a rigid tether (see Tethered Vehicles below).</p>\n<h5>Slam</h5>\n<p>As a standard action, you direct the manipulator to strike a target within its reach by attempting a Piloting check (DC = 5 + the target&rsquo;s KAC). On a success, the manipulator deals half the vehicle&rsquo;s collision damage to the target.<br />If the target of the slam action is a creature, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the vehicle&rsquo;s collision DC to halve the damage. If the target of the slam action is another vehicle, the pilot of the defending vehicle can attempt a Piloting check to halve the damage, with a DC equal to the result of your Piloting check.</p>"
