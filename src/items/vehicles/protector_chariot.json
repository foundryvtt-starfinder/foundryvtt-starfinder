        "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListLandVehicles_ctl00_LabelName\">A Protector chariot is a hybrid vehicle with a virtual intelligence. In its neutral form, the vehicle is a dense, 10-foot-diameter sphere of mercury-like metal. This malleable form can reshape to replicate almost any vehicle of similar size. However, only someone who has the Protector of Kahlannal feat can pilot one of these chariots. When chariots are adjacent to one another, the pilots can command the vehicles to combine and form a larger vehicle. Four chariots in proximity can combine to form a vessel of starship scale, called an Accord.<br /><br />When a pilot wishes to enter a chariot, they touch the surface and telepathically command the vehicle to allow them inside. The chariot surface envelops the pilot, pulling them within. When the vehicle reconfigures, it moves the pilot into a new position suited to piloting the chariot&rsquo;s new form.<br /><br />Once the anassanois integrate with Pact Worlds societies, vehicles similar to chariots might appear on the open market. However, such knockoffs don&rsquo;t come from the anassanois, who would see such replicas as bordering on sacrilegious.</span></p>",

An autopilot&rsquo;s actions are dictated by the GM, and an autopilot can take any of the actions to pilot the vehicle that an actual pilot can. However, autopilots tend to be cautious, rarely risking the integrity of the vehicle and never attempting to ram or run over a target unless specifically programmed as a war machine (indicated in its stat block).<br /><br />The Systems entry in a vehicle&rsquo;s statistics (see page 228) lists the autopilot&rsquo;s modifier to the Piloting skill. For Piloting checks attempted for the Autopilot, apply this modifier first and then apply the vehicle&rsquo;s modifier (listed in the vehicle&rsquo;s Modifiers entry) to the Piloting checks.</span></p>",
