      "value": "<p>If the creature hits with the indicated attack (usually a bite attack), it deals the normal damage. If the creature&rsquo;s attack roll successfully hits the target&rsquo;s KAC + 4, the creature also automatically grapples the foe as part of the attack action. (If it hits the target&rsquo;s KAC + 13, it instead pins the target). The creature doesn&rsquo;t need to have a free limb to perform this grapple. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can swallow whole only targets that are at least one size category smaller than itself, and it has room for a single target of that size in its stomach (doubling the maximum number of creatures it can have swallowed for each additional size category by which these creatures are smaller).</p>\n<p>On the creature&rsquo;s next turn after grappling or pinning the target, if the target has not escaped the grapple or pin, the target automatically takes the attack&rsquo;s damage at the beginning of the creature&rsquo;s turn. The creature can then make a new attack roll with the same attack. If it hits the target&rsquo;s KAC, the grapple or @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.XgK4EdO5D3Fj3iWz]{Pin} is maintained. If it hits the target&rsquo;s KAC + 4, the target is swallowed whole (no damage is dealt).</p>\n<p>Once swallowed, the target takes the listed swallow whole damage automatically at the beginning its turn every round. The target is considered @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} as long as it is swallowed. The target can attempt to cut its way out (the interior of a creature with swallow whole has the same EAC as its exterior and a KAC equal to that of its exterior &ndash; 4) by dealing an amount of damage equal to one-quarter the swallowing creature&rsquo;s total Hit Points, though any attack that does not deal slashing damage deals only half its normal damage. If a target cuts its way out of the creature, the creature cannot use swallow whole again until that damage is healed.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a target swallowed whole can attempt to climb out. The swallowed creature must succeed at both a grapple check against the creature&rsquo;s internal KAC + 8 and an Athletics check to climb (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 &times; the creature&rsquo;s CR). Each of these actions takes a full round. If both checks are successful, the target climbs back up to the creature&rsquo;s mouth and can escape, ending up in an open square adjacent to the creature.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl55_LabelName\"><em>Format</em>: <strong>Melee</strong> bite +19 (5d4+16 P plus swallow whole); <strong>Offensive Abilities</strong> swallow whole (5d4+16 A, EAC 30, KAC 27, 71 HP).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl55_LabelName\"><em>Guidelines</em>: Use the same damage amount as for the creature&rsquo;s standard melee attack.</span></p>",
