Once attached, the creature gains a +4 bonus to its AC (from cover) and a +2 circumstance bonus to melee attacks, but it can attack only the creature to which it is attached. An attached creature can’t move (though it moves with its target), take actions that require two hands, or make attacks of opportunity. An attached creature can be removed with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s CR) made as a move action, or it can remove itself from its target as a move action.</p>\n<p><em>Format</em>:<strong>Melee</strong> attach +6.</p>"
