A troop is immune to effects that target a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells and multiple-target spells such as <em>haste</em>).</p>\n<p>A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from effects that affect all targets in an area, such as grenades, blast and explode weapons, and many evocation spells.</p>\n<p>A troop takes normal damage from an attack or effect that affects multiple targets (including lines and fully automatic mode attacks). For the purposes of the automatic weapon special property, a troop counts as five targets. For example, if an automatic attack is made using 12 rounds of ammunition, the attack affects a maximum of six targets, so it can damage a troop normally. However, if two other targets are closer to the attacker than the troop, they must be attacked first, leaving only four attacks to target the troop, so the troop takes no damage.</p>\n<p><em>Format</em>:<strong>Defensive Abilities</strong> troop defenses.</p>"
