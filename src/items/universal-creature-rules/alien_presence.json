      "value": "<p>(EX OR SU)</p>\n<p>The creature&rsquo;s mere presence can have deleterious effects for those nearby. It can activate this ability as part of the action of making an attack or as a move action, but it can activate it only once per round. It usually has a range of 30 feet. This aura functions as @Compendium[sfrpg.universal-creature-rules.iX7wX2fqqXc1qnDb]{Frightful Presence} (see page 150), but instead of imposing the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} condition on creatures that fail their Will saves, it imposes the listed condition. The duration is 5d6 rounds unless the ability says otherwise. Once an opponent has been exposed to a creature&rsquo;s alien presence (whether or not the opponent succeeds at its saving throw), it cannot be affected by the same creature&rsquo;s alien presence for 24 hours. This is an @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Emotion}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Fear}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Mind-affecting}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent} effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
