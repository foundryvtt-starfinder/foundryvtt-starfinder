      "value": "<p>The creature is aligned to the cycles of solar systems. Creatures with stellar alignment usually have stellar revelations and zenith revelations, either ones from the solarian class or ones unique to the creature. When using stellar revelations, the creature is always considered attuned. However, it&rsquo;s not always considered fully attuned, so it normally can&rsquo;t always use zenith powers. When you roll initiative for the creature, roll 1d3. Once that many rounds have elapsed, the creature is considered fully attuned and gains access to its zenith powers. After it uses a zenith power, it&rsquo;s no longer fully attuned, and you roll 1d3 again to see how many rounds it will take to recharge.</p>\n<p>If a creature has stellar alignment (graviton) or stellar alignment (photon), it&rsquo;s considered to be attuned only in the indicated mode and can become fully attuned only in the indicated mode, as described above.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl53_LabelName\"><em>Format</em>: <strong>Other Abilities</strong> stellar alignment (graviton).</span></p>"
