Each opponent within the gaze’s listed range must attempt a saving throw (usually Fortitude or Will) at the beginning of its turn. On a successful save, the effect is negated. An opponent can give itself an advantage against this ability in one of two ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking Obliquely</strong>: An opponent that avoids looking directly at the creature’s face (either by following the creature’s shadow or by tracking it in a reflective surface) or that looks at the creature through a camera or heads-up display gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the saving throw. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains concealment against that opponent.</p>\n<p><strong>Blocking Its Vision</strong>: By completely blocking or covering its own visual sensors, an opponent doesn’t need to attempt a save against the gaze. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains total concealment against that opponent.</p>\n<p>Gaze abilities can affect ethereal opponents but not opponents without visual sensors. A creature is immune to the gaze abilities of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze ability can still be affected, but they are always considered to be looking obliquely at the creature. The creature can also veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.</p>\n<p><em>Format</em>:<strong>Offensive Abilities</strong> paralyzing gaze (60 ft., Will DC 14).</p>"
