Certain attacks, typically those that deal acid or fire damage, cause a creature&rsquo;s regeneration to stop functioning for 1 round. During this round, the creature doesn&rsquo;t regain Hit Points and can die normally. The creature&rsquo;s stat block describes the types of damage that suppress the regeneration.</p>\n<p>Regeneration doesn&rsquo;t restore Hit Points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Creatures with regeneration can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed body parts if they are recovered within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that aren&rsquo;t reattached wither and decompose normally.</p>\n<p>A creature usually must have a Constitution score or modifier to have this ability.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl44_LabelName\"><em>Format</em>: <strong>Defensive Abilities</strong> regeneration 5 (acid).</span></p>"
