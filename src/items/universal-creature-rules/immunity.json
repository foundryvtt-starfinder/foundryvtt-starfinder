      "value": "<p>(EX OR SU)</p>\n<p>The creature takes no damage from the listed source. Creatures can be immune to certain types of damage, types of @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions}, conditions, spells (based on school, level, or save type), and other effects. A creature that is immune to critical hits doesn’t take double damage or suffer critical hit effects. A creature that is immune to a listed source doesn’t suffer from its effects or from any secondary effects that it would trigger.</p>\n<p>Guidelines: A creature usually has one immunity, plus one for every 5 CR. Broad immunities like immunity to mindaffecting effects or all magic should be chosen with caution and might count as multiple abilities.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
