It can activate this ability as part of the action of making an attack or as a move action, but it can activate it only once per round. It usually has a range of 30 feet. This aura functions as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.universal-creature-rules.iX7wX2fqqXc1qnDb]{Frightful Presence} (see page 150), but instead of imposing the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{Shaken} condition on creatures that fail their Will saves, it imposes the listed condition. The duration is 5d6 rounds unless the ability says otherwise. Once an opponent has been exposed to a creature’s alien presence (whether or not the opponent succeeds at its saving throw), it cannot be affected by the same creature’s alien presence for 24 hours. This is an @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Emotion}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Fear}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Mind-affecting}, and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Sense-dependent} effect.</p>\n<p><em>Format</em>:&nbsp;<strong>Aura</strong> alien presence (240 ft., DC 25, sickened 2d4 rounds).</p>"
