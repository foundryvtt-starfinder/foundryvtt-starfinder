A breath weapon usually allows a target to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, though some breath weapons require a successful Fortitude or Will save instead. A creature is immune to its own breath weapon and the breath weapons of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Each breath weapon also indicates how often it can be used.</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl07_LabelName\"><em>Format</em>: <strong>Offensive Abilities</strong> breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 8d6 F, Reflex DC 18 half, usable every 1d4 rounds); if the breath weapon has more complicated effects, it also has an entry in Special Abilities.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListRulesAll_ctl07_LabelName\"><em>Guidelines</em>: 1d6 damage + 1d6 per CR, usable once every 1d4 rounds.
