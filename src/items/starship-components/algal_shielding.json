      "value": "<p>The algal shielding system can be installed only in a biomechanical starship.</p>\n<p>The hull of a vessel with algal shielding has a layer made of water-filled, valved chambers that circulate blue-green algae through the ship, interfacing with the life-support system and most living parts of the ship. This supplemental circulatory system has two functions. First, the algae act as a radiation buffer. When a biomechanical starship with algal shielding takes damage from a weapon with the irradiate special property (Core Rulebook 304), the algal shielding grants a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against radiation and other @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} introduced to the shipâ€™s internal atmosphere. This system also functions as one hydroponic garden (Pact Worlds 153). If a critical damage effect causes a vesselâ€™s life-support system to become malfunctioning or wrecked, the algal shielding provides no benefit until the life-support systemâ€™s condition is improved to glitching or normal.</p>"
