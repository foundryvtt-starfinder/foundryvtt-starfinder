This weapon can be any longarm whose item level is equal to or less than the starshipâ€™s tier. By spending 5 additional Build Points, the installed weapon can be a heavy weapon (of creature scale, not starship scale). When an antipersonnel weapon is activated, if a hostile creature approaches within the weaponâ€™s range increment, it begins firing with an attack roll modifier equal to the shipâ€™s tier (minimum 1). It fires once per round during combat until its ammunition is depleted or the hostile creature is disabled or flees. The weapon canâ€™t detect invisible (or similarly hidden) creatures. This weapon canâ€™t be removed and used by characters. Anyone with access to the starshipâ€™s computer system can activate or deactivate the weapon, as well designate what kind of targets are considered hostile. Once installed, this weapon canâ€™t be removed from the starship without destroying it.</p>"
