These pods benefit any creature that rests in them whenever the biomechanical starshipâ€™s self-repair criteria are met. A creature that does so regains twice the number of ability points or Hit Points it would by healing naturally. Resting in a healing pod also grants a creature a +2 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks for long-term stability and saving throws against @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.gBhZDjh30JEyh7DY]{Diseases}, @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Drugs}, and @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P.JournalEntryPage.ZaS9H4rwaFIQTUBC]{Poisons} for 24 hours. A healing pods expansion bay contains six pods that can each accommodate a Medium or smaller creature. A Large pod can be installed in place of two Medium ones.</p>"
