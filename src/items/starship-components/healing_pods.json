      "value": "<p>Healing pods can be installed only in a biomechanical starship (PW pg. 152).</p>\n<p>A biomechanical starship can channel energy from its self-repair mechanism to its parts, including its healing pods. These pods benefit any creature that rests in them whenever the biomechanical starshipâ€™s self-repair criteria are met. A creature that does so regains twice the number of ability points or Hit Points it would by healing naturally. Resting in a healing pod also grants a creature a +2 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks for long-term stability and saving throws against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} for 24 hours. A healing pods expansion bay contains six pods that can each accommodate a Medium or smaller creature. A Large pod can be installed in place of two Medium ones.",
