      "value": "A corpse recycler allows a starship crew to render bodies into With powerful computers and complex algorithms, starships are practically able to fly themselves. Yet for those hoping to optimize their starshipsâ€™ performance, there are countless technologies designed to help officers interface with and control their vessels, giving commands at the speed of thought. Others prefer programming their own bridge crew, creating autonomous virtual intelligences able to sustain a shipâ€™s functions for  millennia. The options in this chapter give starship crews a heightened level of control in customizing and perfecting their vessel. parts for necrografts (Starfinder Armory 94).
