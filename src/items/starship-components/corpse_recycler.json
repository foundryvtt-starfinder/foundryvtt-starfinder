Yet for those hoping to optimize their starshipsâ€™ performance, there are countless technologies designed to help officers interface with and control their vessels, giving commands at the speed of thought. Others prefer programming their own bridge crew, creating autonomous virtual intelligences able to sustain a shipâ€™s functions for  millennia. The options in this chapter give starship crews a heightened level of control in customizing and perfecting their vessel. parts for necrografts (Starfinder Armory 94). In a process that takes 1 hour, a carcass fed into the recycler produces a number of necrograft UPBs equal to 10 Ã— the CR of the creature from which the corpse originated. These UPBs can be used only to create necrografts"
