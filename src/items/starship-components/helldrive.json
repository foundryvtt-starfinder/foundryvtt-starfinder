Today, Helldrives are most commonly found in the fleets of the Hellknights, supporting their mission to bring the rule of law to a chaotic universe.</p>\n<p>Hell is a brutal and orderly plane; it is full of dangers for the unwary, but it honors its agreements. Each Helldrive functions as a physical contract permitting relatively easy&mdash;though rarely truly safe&mdash;passage through Hell. The Church of Asmodeus constructs each Helldrive individually, customized for the ship that will carry it, and only those who follow the strict tenets of Hell to the letter are allowed to use them. Helldrives run on fuel condensed from damned souls, and some planar scientists speculate that the very act of operating a Helldrive is akin to signing an infernal contract, with the user&rsquo;s soul pledged to become fuel for the next generation of Helldrives.</p>\n<p><strong>Restricted:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Church of Asmodeus, Hellknights)</p>"
