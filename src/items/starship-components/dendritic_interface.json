      "value": "<p>This unique system, an innovation of the raxilites, allows up to four of a biomechanical starshipâ€™s crew members to bond their nervous systems to the dendritic filaments of the vesselâ€™s computer. Most biomechanical ships have an empathetic response, but a dendritic interfaceâ€™s connection allows for a much higher level of clear communication, akin to limited telepathy between connected crew and the computer. It takes 1 round of starship combat for a crew member to become bonded with the dendritic interface, and doing so must be that crew memberâ€™s action for that round. A bonded crew member can reduce penalties to crew actions by 2. In addition, a bonded engineer gains a +2 insight bonus to the hold it together, patch, and quick fix crew actions, as well as checks to repair systems outside starship combat.</p>"
