      "value": "<p>This high-tech chamber allows biological organisms to enter a form of stasis via a rapid freezing process and be sustained in pods for a long duration. Cryo-chambers can be set to keep an organism in stasis for a set duration, indefinitely, or until certain conditions are met, such as arrival at a navigational milestone or if the vessel comes under attack. During the days before Drift travel, most starship crews used these chambers to survive the months-long trips between destinations. Some exploration ships still use cryo-chambers in lieu of crew quarters, particularly those that regularly travel in the Vast. The Azlanti Star Empire has developed its own variation on the cryo-chamber, which is more compact but virtually unknown outside of Azlanti space (AP #7 pg. 47).</p>\n<p>A cryo-chamber can hold up to eight Medium or smaller creatures or four Large creatures in stasis for as long as the systems have adequate power. A cryo-chamber can instead be outfitted to hold a single Huge or Gargantuan creature, and two cryo-chambers can be combined to hold a single Colossal creature.</p>\n<p> While in stasis in a cryo-chamber, a creature no longer advances on affliction tracks, and doesnâ€™t suffer from starvation, thirst, or sleep deprivation. Placing a creature in stasis or removing it from stasis takes 1 hour, after which the creature is  sickened for 1 day unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save.</p>",
