      "value": "<p>A quantum defender enables a starship to enter an unpredictable quantum state for a short time, enabling it to phase in and out of existence at just the right time to avoid harm. During the helm phase, as a crew action, a science officer can activate the quantum defender by succeeding at a Computers check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 Ã— the starshipâ€™s tier). While the quantum defender is active, if an attack would normally hit the ship, the attacker must reroll the gunnery check and take the lower result. After that reroll, or at the end of a round during which no such reroll occurs, the ship returns to its normal state as the quantum defender deactivates.</p>\n<p>A quantum defenderâ€™s BP cost is equal to 4 Ã— the starshipâ€™s size category (for the purpose of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, etc.) or 10 BP, whichever is greater. A quantum defenderâ€™s PCU requirement is either 20 or is equal to 5 Ã— the starshipâ€™s size category, whichever is greater.</p>"
