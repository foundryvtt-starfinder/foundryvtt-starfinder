A launch tube takes up two expansion bays and can hold one Tiny starship. If a vessel needs to dock in a launch tube during combat, it occurs at the end of the helm phase and requires a successful DC 10 Piloting skill check; this check takes a â€“1 penalty for each hex the smaller ship has moved this round. A failed check means that the ship doesnâ€™t dock with the larger vessel.</p>"
