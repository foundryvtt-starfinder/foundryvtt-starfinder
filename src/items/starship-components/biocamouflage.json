      "value": "<p>A biomechanical ship with a biocamouflage system can appear to be an astronomical body rather than a starship. A vessel that can land can instead appear to be a geological formation rather than a starship. To appear to be either, the starship must move in a straight trajectory, engaging in no turns or other maneuvers an astronomical body could not duplicate; the DC to scan the starship then increases by 5. If the check to scan the camouflaged ship fails, the scanner believes the ship is an astronomical body or geological object, taking a â€“4 penalty to further scans while the belief endures. This belief ends as soon as the camouflaged starship makes any maneuver or change in speed impossible for the object the starship is believed to be.</p>"
