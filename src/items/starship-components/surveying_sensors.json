When scanning such targets, the science officer doubles the bonus to Computers checks granted by the starshipâ€™s sensors (maximum +8). The surveying sensors also double the range of the starshipâ€™s sensors to 500 feet while in atmosphere or on planets. The augmented sensors provide no special benefits during starship combat."
