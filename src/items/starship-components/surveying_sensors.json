When scanning such targets, the science officer doubles the bonus to Computers checks granted by the starship’s sensors (maximum +8). The surveying sensors also double the range of the starship’s sensors to 500 feet while in atmosphere or on planets. The augmented sensors provide no special benefits during starship combat.</p>"
