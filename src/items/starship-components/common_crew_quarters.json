Crew members who sleep in common quarters usually keep their personal possessions in a footlocker. Common crew quarters also include a communal bathroom (which includes a military-style shower) and a tiny galley (big enough to prepare only the most basic of meals). Starships with crews numbering in the dozens or hundreds often have massive barracks where crew members sleep in shifts .</p>"
