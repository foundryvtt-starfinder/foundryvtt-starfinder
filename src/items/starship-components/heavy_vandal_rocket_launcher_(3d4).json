A vandal rocket that manages&nbsp;to breach a ship’s shields bursts into animated&nbsp;demolition drones that set to work taking the&nbsp;ship apart, piece by piece. Survivors of an&nbsp;encounter with jinsuls sold inactive vandal&nbsp;rocket drones to several Pact Worlds&nbsp;manufacturers who reverseâ€‘engineered the technology,&nbsp;making them available to the wider galaxy. These weapons&nbsp;have the vandal drones special property (see below).</p>\n<h3>Vandal Drones</h3>\n<p>When a weapon with this special property deals Hull Point&nbsp;damage to a ship, pieces of the projectile’s shrapnel animate&nbsp;into drones that continue to rend the target. Each successive&nbsp;gunnery phase, the struck starship loses the listed amount of&nbsp;Hull Points until the drones are either forcibly removed during&nbsp;the engineering phase with an Engineering check (DC 15 + 2 ×&nbsp;the engineer’s starship’s tier) or shaken off by the pilot during&nbsp;the helm phase with a successful barrel roll, flip and burn,&nbsp;or flyby stunt. Multiple applications of this effect don’t stack;&nbsp;only the highest damage applies.</p>"
