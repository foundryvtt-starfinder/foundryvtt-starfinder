      "value": "<p>Created by the Hellknights to aid them in capturing enemy vessels, this device creates an area of “Drift shadow” when activated. The Drift shadow extends out to a range of 10 hexes from the activating ship, and each vessel in this area treats @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} rating of its engine as if it were 2 lower. If this reduces the engine’s rating to less than 1, that vessel cannot enter @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} while in the shadow. Ships attempting enter normal space from @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} into an area of Drift shadow are affected in the same way. Shadows created by multiple vessels stack, making it impossible for any ship to enter or exit @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}.</p>"
