      "value": "This expansion bay can be configured to duplicate various environments, simulating them down to the smallest detail. The simulator is primarily used to clandestinely move creatures without their knowledge. For example, the grays have transplanted individuals threatened by natural disaster or environmental concerns without revealing their own existence. When used for this purpose, the simulator even slowly changes the appearance of stars in the sky until they match the night sky of the location to which the creatures in the simulator will be moved. The bay can also be used to covertly observe creatures in a simulation of their natural environment, benefiting from greater control over environmental effects such as weather. A habitat simulator can hold up to four Medium creatures (while still providing a believable simulation) and takes up 3 expansion bays. The simulator can sustain a particular environment for 1 month before it needs to be cleaned out, refreshed, and resupplied."
