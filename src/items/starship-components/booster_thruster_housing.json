During starship combat, the pilot can activate these additional thrusters before moving the starship during the helm phase as part of their crew action. When activated, the additional boosters increase the starship’s speed by an amount equal to the boosters’ listed speed divided by 4 (rounded down) and increase the DC of Piloting checks to perform stunts that round by an equal amount. The boosters’ supplemental fuel supply can power them for 5 rounds, after which the thrusters need 24 hours to recharge from the ship’s power core. A starship can have only one such additional booster active at a time.</p>"
