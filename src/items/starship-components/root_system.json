A vessel that has a root system can instead attach to a planet, asteroid, or other astronomical body to acquire materials and energy for self‑repair. Larger ships can use a root system to carry such self-repair fuel with the craft. Such use of available material is usually enough for self-repair to function as normal, subject to GM discretion.</p>"
