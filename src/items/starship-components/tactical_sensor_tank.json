Science officers can use a TST to link the sensors of any number of allied vessels in range of the TST-equipped shipâ€™s sensors. The sensor range for all linked ships extends as far as the farthest-reaching range among them, since the TST system collects data from linked vessels, correlates possible sensor targets, and sends that information to all linked ships.</p>"
