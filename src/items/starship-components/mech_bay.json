While a mech is housed in a mech bay, repairs on it take half the time and shield regeneration is twice as fast. Mechs can be deployed from the bay directly to a planet’s surface if the ship is landed, or they can be loaded into an available @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.vehicles.Actor.x0klv9uWW4crarM5]{drop pod} (<em>Starship Operations Manual</em> 25) or @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.ZCdtfwxHAsEthpzy]{sky crane} (page 29).</p>"
