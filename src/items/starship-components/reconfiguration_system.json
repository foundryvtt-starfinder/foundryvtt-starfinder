A reconfiguration system enables a starship to physically change shape; it can appear to be any other vessel of the same size without changing any of the shipâ€™s statistics. In addition, the reconfigured ship mimics the transponders and scan profile of the ship it is impersonating. When the reconfigured ship is scanned, the first piece of information the scanning science officer obtains is always false, conforming to the ship the reconfigured vessel is pretending to be rather than what the reconfigured ship actually is. It takes only a few moments for this system to reconfigure a starship thatâ€™s out of combat, but it cannot function if the shipâ€™s sensors have a critical damage condition. However, if the shipâ€™s sensors gain a critical damage condition while the ship is reconfigured, the vessel remains in its reconfigured state.</p>"
