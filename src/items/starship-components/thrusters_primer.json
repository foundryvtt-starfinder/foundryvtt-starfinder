      "value": "<p>By dedicating additional space to the thrusters and related systems, a starship can vastly decrease the amount of time needed for its thrusters to warm up and engage. The thrusters primer reduces the time needed to start the thrusters (CRB pg. 291) from 1 minute per size category to 1 round per size category, allowing even immense starships to finish the ignition sequence in less than a minute. During the first engineering phase of starship combat, a thrusters primer grants a short boost to a starshipâ€™s propulsion, automatically increasing the starshipâ€™s speed by 2 as though the engineer had used the divert action to direct power to the engines.</p>"
