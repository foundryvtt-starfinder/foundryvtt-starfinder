When the spinning gears are engaged, they create pockets of extradimensional space between the cogs that jump the whole assembly (along with the attached starship) forward in space, referred to as &ldquo;skipping.&rdquo; By varying the orientation of the drive assembly and the rotational speed at which the gears are engaged, a skilled operator can alter the direction and distance of a skip. The onos drive was key to the early Azlanti Star Empire&rsquo;s conquest of the Aristia system before the Gap, but it was still far too slow to be used for interstellar travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Restricted:&nbsp;</strong>(Azlanti Star Empire)</p>"
