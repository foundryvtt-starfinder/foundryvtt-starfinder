      "value": "<p>The hardened corpses of paraforans who have perished on the Material Plane can be constructed into rigid shells that attach to a starship’s Drift engine (and can be selected when building or upgrading a starship). Known as paraforan resonators, they pulse with a rainbow of colors when the accompanying Drift engine operates. A paraforan resonator grants a pilot a bonus to Piloting checks to navigate a course through @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} equal to the resonator’s mark. In addition, when calculating travel times through @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, a paraforan resonator allows the pilot to reroll a number of d6s equal to the resonator’s mark, though the pilot must use the second result. The cost in Build Points is based on the starship’s size category (for the purposes of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, and so on).</p>"
