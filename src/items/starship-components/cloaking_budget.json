      "value": "<p>Cloaking technology is not widely available in Near Space, but scientists have developed several systems that enable starships to avoid detection by other starships. Activating a cloaking device takes one action by an engineer while the starship is neither in motion nor engaged in combat. The ship vanishes from view, and based on the cloaking deviceâ€™s level, another ship must have sensors of a minimum level to detect it.</p>\n<p>Cloaking technology is named for the maximum quality of sensors that canâ€™t detect the cloaked ship. Cut-rate cloaking technology fools only cut-rate sensors; budget cloaking technology fools only cut-rate and budget sensors, and so on. Sensors capable of detecting a cloaked starship can do so only when the cloaked starship has entered the sensorâ€™s first range increment. Engaging a Drift engine or thrusters or beginning starship combat immediately negates the cloaking ability, whereupon the ship reappears and can be detected normally.</p>"
