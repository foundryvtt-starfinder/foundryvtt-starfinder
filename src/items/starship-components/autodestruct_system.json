      "value": "<p>An autodestruct system is a self-destruct mechanism that removes the crewâ€™s ability to avoid destruction in a crisis. When a starship outfitted with an autodestruct system is reduced to 0 Hull Points, the autodestruct system activates, destroying the ship itâ€™s built into. Starships in hexes adjacent to a starship as it autodestructs take damage to the appropriate quadrants equal to half the destroyed starshipâ€™s maximum Hull Points, mitigated by shields as normal.</p>\n<p>An autodestruct system is hardwired into the ship and has no interface that can be hacked or disabled. Once installed, it can be removed only with 1 day of work and a successful Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 Ã— the starshipâ€™s tier). Failing this check means the autodestruct system remains active, and the engineer is aware of that fact.</p>"
