A lido is designed to maximize relaxation with calming music, simulated sunlight, and other factors to recharge guests and crew. Luxury liners often include a lido, but they can be found on smaller ships as well. You can use a lido for 4 hours before using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.73lSOAnF2qMQLWoS.JournalEntryPage.cxIyFLVUYM3tCHZJ]{carouse} downtime activity (Character Operations Manual 151); this reduces the cumulative penalty to the saving throw for carousing repeatedly by 2.</p>"
