      "value": "<p>Used in the Azlanti Star Empire for moving large numbers of troops efficiently, a Drift stasis unit holds living creatures in a state of suspended animation ideal for long periods of Drift travel. Placing creatures into stasis or removing them from stasis takes 1 hour. An unwilling creature can be placed in a Drift stasis unit only if it is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}. While in stasis, a creature is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious} and doesn’t need to breathe, drink, or eat. One stasis unit can hold 32 Medium creatures in stasis for 30 days with no ill effects. (A Large creature counts as 2 Medium ones for this purpose.)</p>\n<p>After 30 days, creatures held in stasis are at risk of Drift stasis sickness, a disease with the parameters shown in the stat block below.</p>\n<p><h2>Drift Stasis Sickness</h2></p>\n<p><b>Type</b> disease (31 days of Drift stasis); <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 15 (see Effect and Cure)</p>\n<p><b>Track</b> physical; Frequency 1/day</p>\n<p><b>Effect</b> no latent state; increase the DC by 1 for each previous save attempted against the disease, up to a maximum of DC 22.</p>\n<p><b>Cure</b> The victim must be removed from Drift stasis, then succeed at 2 consecutive saves. The DC goes down by 1 each day the victim spends removed from Drift stasis, to a minimum of DC 15."
