      "value": "<p>To help minimize crew cost and space requirements, enterprising starliners have developed robotic servants that can readily swap functions by way of interchanging modular parts. These robots operate under the guidance of the ship’s computer and travel about the ship on specially designed lanes, out of the way of guests and crew. While they fulfill simple, daily tasks on a ship in a usually unremarkable way, they can exhibit eccentricities if their software isn’t well maintained.</p>\n<p>A ship with a modular service robot system halves the time it takes to make repairs.</p>\n<p>When installed in a @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.starship-components.Item.9BASEuKPiH2eYC2J]{luxury ship} (page 30), a modular service robot system also replaces the crew required to accommodate guests with simple, modularly constructed robotic servants. These robots care for the ship, its crew, passengers, and each other, and they can operate most expansion bays. These robots can’t take combat actions, but they also don’t require crew quarters, freeing up installed quarters for passengers and crew.</p>"
