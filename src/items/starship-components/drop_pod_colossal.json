      "value": "<p>A drop pod is a reinforced vehicle designed to transport a group of soldiers or small vehicles from a starship orbiting high above a planet to that planetâ€™s surface. Each drop pod is a single-use device equipped with heat shields to deflect the heat of atmospheric entry as well as thrusters strong enough to make small course corrections and slow the rate of descent before reaching the surface.</p>\n<p>A typical expansion bay can store and launch one Gargantuan drop pod that can hold up to four Huge creatures, eight Large creatures, or 16 Medium or smaller creatures or vehicles. Alternatively, an expansion bay can be outfitted with two Huge drop pods (AP #24 pg. 52). A Colossal drop pod takes up two expansion bays, costs twice as many PCU and BP, and doubles the number of creatures and vehicles the pod can carry (or allows the drop pod to carry up to four Gargantuan creatures).</p>"
