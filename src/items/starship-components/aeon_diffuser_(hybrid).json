      "value": "The hull of a vessel with algal shielding has a layer made of water-filled valved chambers that circulate blue-green algae through the ship, interfacing with the life-support system and most living parts of the ship. This supplemental circulatory system has two functions. First, the algae act as a radiation buffer. When a biomechanical starship with algal shielding takes damage from a weapon with the irradiate property, the ship takes fewer critical damage effects from the radiation. In addition, the algal shielding grants a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against radiation and other @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} introduced to the shipâ€™s internal atmosphere. Algae from this system also functions as one hydroponic garden. If a critical damage effect causes a vesselâ€™s life-support to become malfunctioning or wrecked, the algal shielding provides no benefit until the condition of life support is improved to glitching or normal.",
