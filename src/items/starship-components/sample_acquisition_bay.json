      "value": "This bay is equipped with a hybrid tractor beam that quickly pulls a target into the vessel. This beam can target a Large or smaller creature (or object of similar size) that is within 500 feet and visible to the starshipâ€™s sensors. However, the beam canâ€™t be activated if the vessel is in starship combat. While within the beam, the targetâ€™s molecules are phased slightly, rendering the target incorporeal. The beam moves the target from its original position into the bay (or vice versa) over 2 rounds. If the target is conscious and unwilling, it can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 Ã— the starshipâ€™s tier) when it is first struck with the beam to negate its effect."
