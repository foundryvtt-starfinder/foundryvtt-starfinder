      "value": "<p>Used most often as a last resort, a self-destruct system completely destroys the starship on which it is installed (as if the ship had taken damage equal to twice its Hull Points), often killing everyone on board. A starship in a hex adjacent to a starship that self-destructs takes an amount of damage equal to half the destroyed starshipâ€™s maximum Hull Points; this damage can be mitigated by shields. A self-destruct system can be activated only by creatures on the starship (by turning a set of keys, typing in a specific passcode, or other physical means known only to high-ranking members of the crew) and canâ€™t be activated remotely via hacking. The activating creatures set a time delay for the destruction (at least 1 round of starship combat). The cost of a self-destruct system depends on the size category of the ship (for the purposes of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, and so on).</p>"
