      "value": "An aeon comm is a cylindrical booth constructed of resonant crystal that allows remote observation of and communication to space around an aeon stone. A pedestal in the center of the booth can hold one aeon stone, and as an action, a user can mystically connect that stone to the nearest stone of the same type with a system-wide range. Alternatively, a user can attune the booth to a known aeon stone of the same type in the same system. In either case, the booth creates an invisible magical sensor centered on the targeted aeon stone. The boothâ€™s crystal reflects the targeted stoneâ€™s visual and auditory surroundings as if the user were standing at the stoneâ€™s location. This view doesnâ€™t move unless the targeted stone does, but a viewer can turn within the booth to observe the area as desired. A user within the booth can activate the aeon commâ€™s communication function to speak through the targeted aeon stone, and unlike with technological system-wide communications, the message is transmitted instantaneously."
