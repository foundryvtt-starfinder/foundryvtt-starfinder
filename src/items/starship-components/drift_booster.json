A smaller ship that launches from within the Supercolossal vesselâ€™s hangar bay using @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} booster can temporarily raise its Drift engine rating by 1. This increase lasts only as long as the smaller ship stays in @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} and on the same course after launching using @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift} booster. If the boosted ship changes course or leaves @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, this temporary increase ends.</p>"
