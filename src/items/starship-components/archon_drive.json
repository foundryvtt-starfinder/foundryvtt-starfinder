A ball of light hangs in the center of the engine, radiating rainbow light all over the ship&rsquo;s engineering section and bathing the crew in color. Many ships equipped with archon drives hold regular worship services during interstellar journeys, as it is a common belief that the focused prayers of a ship&rsquo;s crew can increase the drive&rsquo;s efficiency.</p>\n<p>Archon drives were in existence at the end of the Gap and were one of only a very few means of achieving interstellar travel before the advent of Drift tech, though they were&mdash; and still are&mdash;tightly controlled by the church of Iomedae.</p>\n<p><strong>Restricted:</strong>&nbsp;(Church of Iomedae, Knights of Golarion)<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">&nbsp;</span></p>"
