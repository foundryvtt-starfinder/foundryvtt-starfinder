      "value": "<p>A life-giving tree of light with roots penetrating every corner of the vessel feeds magic energy directly into various subsystems. A crystalline cable network lines bulkheads and converts the unrealized dreams of the crews into a memetic turbine. A creature captured from the outer planes churns the energy dynamos of a null-space reactor. However it accomplishes the task, a magical power core converts magical energy into usable power for a starship. These hybrid devices donâ€™t have backup battery systems, but in emergencies, a spellcaster can feed spells into a magic power core to power life support, gravity, and comms (but no other systems). Each spell slot sacrificed to the power core provides 2 hours of emergency power per level of the spell slot. An arcane dawn magic power core can be used on Tiny, Small, and Medium ships. An arcane zenith core can be used on Medium, Large, and Huge ships. An arcane dusk core can be used on Huge, Gigantic, and Colossal ships.</p>"
