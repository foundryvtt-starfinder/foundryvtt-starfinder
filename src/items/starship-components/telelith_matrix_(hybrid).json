      "value": "<p>A telelith matrix contains bizarre fibers that flex when they build up enough energy. When they do, they can hurl the connected starship through a temporary wormhole. A telelith matrix takes 1 expansion bay, consumes 10 PCUs, and costs 8 Build Points. A telelith matrix works only in starships of Large or smaller size.</p>\n<p><strong>Telelith Gambit (Stunt)</strong></p>\n<p>When you activate a telelith matrix or move into a hex where a telelith matrix was activated in the same round as it was activated, you can attempt the Audacious Gambit pilot action. If you succeed, your starship teleports through space, disappearing from its current hex and reappearing in a hex up to its speed away in any direction with any facing you desire. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you teleport 1d4 hexes in a random direction and stop with a random facing. If your starship would arrive in a hex that is occupied, the vessel instead arrives in a random hex adjacent to the occupied one.</p>"
