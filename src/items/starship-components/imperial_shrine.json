Once per starship combat, during a captain action that targets fellow crew members, the captain of a vessel that has an imperial shrine can evoke the Aeon Throne. If the captain does so, provided the targeted crew members are Azlanti citizens or have positive associations with the Aeon Throne, the captain gains a +4 circumstance modifier to the skill check the captain action requires.</p>"
