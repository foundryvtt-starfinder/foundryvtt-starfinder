      "value": "<p>You have a powerful affinity with the beasts of the wild. Perhaps you descend from—or were infected by—a lycanthrope or similar creature, were subjected to the rituals of a beastly fiend, or performed ancestral trials to pledge yourself to a beast spirit. Whatever the source, you fight and hunt like a wild thing, and you know the natural side of worlds like you were born to them.</p><h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)</h2><p>You have sterling instincts when it comes to understanding wild places. When you attempt a Life Science, Physical Science, or Survival check to recall knowledge about animals or terrestrial wilderness environments, reduce the DC by 5. Survival is a class skill for you, though if it's also a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Wisdom at character creation.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.lNkqx1Eb6zm7iPuN]{BESTIAL LINEAGE (6TH)}</h2><p>Your animalistic affinity increases. Select one of the following that best fits your ancestral animal or bestial influence.</p><ul><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.BntdefgQshi0eOdN]{Feline Leap}:</strong> You are as lithe as a cat. When you jump, you are always considered to have a running start, and the DC for jumping vertically is equal to twice the number of feet you are attempting to jump (instead of four times).</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.Bs9x6oUyQp8uLwy7]{Lupine Tactics}:</strong>&nbsp;Your instincts lead you to flank foes and bring them down for the kill. When you @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.Kjba2E3Ad5oMJ7hV.JournalEntryPage.X0cZZItDqyTDLhz2]{flank} an opponent, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll to perform the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.U37n5tY5hn1ctzQL.JournalEntryPage.R33uiOMesYP0ISWl#trip]{trip} combat maneuver against that opponent, in addition to the benefits of flanking. This bonus does not stack with other effects that grant you a bonus to perform the trip combat maneuver.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.6VJuXWxvppNOSMlC]{Rodent Scurry}:</strong> You are adept at skittering past foes or even underfoot. When using the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0#tumble]{tumble} task of the @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.3QdtsfnVJsHEdrt0]{Acrobatics} skill, you move at full speed.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.kmObmPKgGMWEhCyw]{Saurian Carnage}:</strong> Like the powerful saurian predators of worlds such as @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, you are a terror to behold, especially when you spill enemies’ blood. When you successfully @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.JournalEntry.GMkLZsN3a7YPvA03.JournalEntryPage.6fqgiVqlA7u9jS4i#demoralize]{demoralize} a creature, that creature is @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.conditions.Item.nywSVEeDvp1bk7L3]{shaken} for an additional round, or 2 additional rounds if that creature has witnessed you killing or disabling an enemy during the current encounter.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.2zuDhOYAOF7NYMXP]{Ursine Fury}:</strong>&nbsp;Injuries don’t make you weak, they make you angry. While you have no Stamina Points remaining, you gain a +5 foot bonus to your speed and you do not suffer the penalty to attack rolls or AC incurred by a charge.</li></ul><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.oFQ2ElhAhMsxyRiC]{WILD HUNT (12TH)}</h2><p>Your sense of smell has become as sharp as your ancestors’. You gain @UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.rules.rX5rK6UWAIOeeipl.JournalEntryPage.p0o9tmWtKZ0qy8DI#blindsense]{Blindsense} (scent) with a range of 30 feet.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.theme-features.Item.mOSrf4m5ttBhf8iR]{ANIMAL INSTINCTS (18TH)}</h2><p>Up to twice per day, you can spend 10 minutes giving in to your animalistic impulses in some harmless fashion to recover 1 Resolve Point; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. For example, a feline beastblood might spend her time playfully stalking friends, chasing butterflies (or someone’s laser sight), or otherwise playing in feline fashion, while a saurian beastblood might spend time sunning themself on a warm stone.</p>"
