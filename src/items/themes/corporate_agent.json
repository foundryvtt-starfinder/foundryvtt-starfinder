      "value": "<p>Corporations control much of the modern world, from the food each person eats to the weapons a soldier deploys on the field of battle. You are an agent of one such corporation, which relies on your negotiation, deal-making, and your natural cunning to advance its agendas. Whether you are making proposals to agents of other corporations to split the mining rights for a valuable asteroid or establishing your corporation's presence on a newly discovered world, you are the company's eyes, ears, and hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THEME KNOWLEDGE (<span class=\"levelNum\">1ST)</span></h2>\n<p>You are deeply connected to the world of corporate culture, and know all the movers and shakers. When attempting a Profession or Culture check to recall knowledge about corporations and their executives, reduce the DC by 5. Diplomacy is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Diplomacy checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Charisma at character creation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NETWORKING (<span class=\"levelNum\">6TH)</span></h2>\n<p>If your corporate database doesn't have a piece of information you are searching for, you probably know someone who does. It takes you only 10 minutes to attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information, as long as you have connection to a local infosphere or a quick way to communicate with contacts in a settlement that is at least technologically average (see Starfinder Core Rulebook 406). Additionally if you have access to a local infosphere, you can take 20 on a skill check to recall knowledge in half the normal time (typically 1 minute).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>STRONG-ARM TACTICS (<span class=\"levelNum\">12TH)</span></h2>\n<p>When you throw the name of your company around, you can usually get what you want, though acting in such a way never wins you any friends. When you successfully use Intimidate to bully a creature, its change in attitude lasts three times as long. At the GM's discretion, this ability might not work on creatures that haven't heard of your corporation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>SEAL THE DEAL (<span class=\"levelNum\">18TH)</span></h2>\n<p>Nothing is more thrilling to you than engaging in spirited discussion to pursue your employer's interests. It is why you were hired, and it's why you venture out into the wider cosmos. Up to twice per day, after you spend at least 10 minutes bargaining and negotiating (this doesn't count as resting to regain Stamina Points) or using an infosphere to research details relevant to a deal that is significantly advantageous to your company, you regain 1 Resolve Point.</p>",
