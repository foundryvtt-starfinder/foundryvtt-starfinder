Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.<br><br>A charmed creature retains its original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that it now regards the person who charmed it as a dear friend and gives great weight to that character’s suggestions and directions. A charmed creature does not volunteer information or tactics that its master doesn’t ask for. A charmed creature never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to it.<br><br>A creature fights friends it had before being charmed only if they threaten its new friend. Even then, it uses the least lethal means at its disposal, for it wishes to resolve the conflict without causing real harm.<br><br>A charmed creature can attempt an opposed Charisma check against its master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make it do something it wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If it succeeds at this check, it decides not to go along with that particular order but remains charmed. If the creature’s master commands it to perform an action that the creature would be vehemently opposed to, it can attempt a new saving throw to break free of its master’s influence altogether.<br><br>If a charmed creature is openly attacked by the character who charmed it or by that character’s apparent allies, it is automatically freed of the spell or effect.",

If the effect has a duration other than instantaneous, magic or some other energy holds the creation together, but when the duration ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the effect has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature does not depend on any outside energy for its existence, so it lasts indefinitely once created.",

Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same sensory abilities that you have naturally, but not any sensory abilities you gain from other spells or technology. The sensor is a separate, independent source of sensory input for you, and thus it functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened or otherwise suffer sensory impairment.<br><br>A creature can notice a scrying sensor with a successful Perception check (DC = 20 + the spell or effect’s level). The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell. Lead sheeting, force fields, and some exotic materials and magical protections block scrying effects; if that is the case, you can sense that the effect has been blocked.",

When the effect ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from (typically another plane, but not always), but a summoned object is not sent back unless the effect description specifically indicates otherwise. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its Hit Points drop to 0, but it is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform in the place from which it was summoned, during which time it can’t be summoned again.<br><br>When a summoning effect ends and the summoned creature disappears, all spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have.",

            "TeleportationDescription": "A teleportation effect involves instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane (see page 471). Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation unless the specific effect notes otherwise, and teleportation effects work within the Drift.",

When making a single attack with such a weapon, you can choose which damage type to deal, but if you make more than one attack in the same round, at least one of those attacks must be made with the second damage type. The weapon category of a double weapon that deals more than one damage type is based on the first damage type listed. If its second damage type causes it to be considered a different weapon category when dealing that damage, that category is listed in parentheses. For example, a double weapon in the flame category that deals 1d6 fire damage or 1d6 cold damage lists “double (cryo)” to indicate that when it is used to deal cold damage, it is treated as a weapon in the cryo category.",
        "WeaponPropertiesDrainCharge": "吸収 [Drain Charge]",
        "WeaponPropertiesDrainChargeTooltip": "When a weapon with the drain charge weapon special property hits an enemy that has a natural attack that deals electricity damage (an attack not dependent on armor upgrades, spells, spell-like abilities, or carried weapons or equipment), it siphons off some of that target’s inherent electricity and regains the number of charges listed in the weapon’s usage entry.",
        "WeaponPropertiesEcho": "共鳴 [Echo]",
        "WeaponPropertiesEchoTooltip": "An echo weapon establishes a lingering sonic resonance within a target. A creature with blindsense or blindsight (vibration or sound) can detect a target hit by an echo weapon at a distance of up to 10 × its normal range. This does not grant blindsense or blindsight to creatures that do not already have this ability.",
        "WeaponPropertiesEntangle": "粘着 [Etg]",
        "WeaponPropertiesEntangleTooltip": "A creature hit by an entangle weapon becomes entangled until it escapes with an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 + weapon’s item level + the attacker’s Dexterity modifier) or a Strength check (DC = 15 + weapon’s item level + the attacker’s Dexterity modifier). An entangled creature can attempt such a check as a move action. Some weapons (such as stickybomb grenades) have a maximum duration for this effect. See page 275 for information about the entangled condition.",
        "WeaponPropertiesExplode": "爆発 [Exp]",
        "WeaponPropertiesExplodeTooltip": "Explosives have the explode special property, which lists the amount of damage the explosion deals, the damage type, special effects (with a duration, if necessary), and the radius of the explosion. When you attack with this type of weapon or ammunition, aim at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage but can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. If the explode special property has any special effects other than damage, they are negated with a successful saving throw. If you score a critical hit, it applies only to the creature closest to the targeted intersection (you choose the creature if several are equally close). Some exploding weapons, such as smoke grenades, don’t deal damage, so they don’t include the damage and damage type entries.",
        "WeaponPropertiesExtinguish": "消火 [Extinguish]",
        "WeaponPropertiesExtinguishTooltip": "You can expend all remaining charges of this weapon (even if it has only a single charge or use) as a swift action to remove the burning condition from yourself or an adjacent creature, or to quench the flames in 1 square. If the weapon affects an area, it extinguishes all flames in that area (including ending the burning condition for all targets fully within the area). Extinguishing flames does not prevent the area from catching fire again, especially if flames survive nearby.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFeint": "フェイント [Feint]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFeintTooltip": "When using this weapon to feint (Core Rulebook 247), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Bluff check.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFiery": "発火 [Fiery]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFieryTooltip": "Fiery ammunition bursts into glowing embers when fired. While this is not enough to change its normal damage to fire damage, any extra damage from a critical hit is considered fire damage and the weapon deals half damage to targets that take half damage from energy attacks but no damage from kinetic attacks (such as incorporeal creatures) and counts as a weapon with the explode special property against creatures with swarm defenses. If fiery ammunition is used in a weapon that already deals half fire damage (such as a weapon with the flaming weapon fusion), on a critical hit, all the damage dealt is fire damage. At the GM’s discretion, fiery ammunition can set extremely flammable materials on fire, such as oil-soaked rags or dry tinder.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFirstArc": "放電 [First Arc]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFirstArcTooltip": "A weapon with the first arc special property always generates an electrical arc, per the critical hit effect whenever it hits a target.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFlexibleLine": "飛び火 [FlxLine]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFlexibleLineTooltip": "A flexible weapon generates lines of effect at a distance from the user. Choose two points, both of which must be within the weapon’s first range increment. The weapon’s effect extends from one point to the other. Other than this placement, resolve the attack per the line weapon special property.",
        "WeaponPropertiesForce": "力場 [Force]",
        "WeaponPropertiesForceTooltip": "A force weapon is treated as having the force descriptor, which can cause it to interact differently with some targets (as defined by the targets’ special rules). Force weapons deal kinetic damage but still target EAC.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFreeHands": "ハンズフリー [FH]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFreeHandsTooltip": "A free hands weapon is unbalanced or otherwise awkward to use. This difficulty in using the weapon can be negated by moving the listed number of hands that are not holding anything or being used for any other purpose as counterweights. You wield a free hands weapon using the normal number of hands, but if you have the listed number of free hands available while wielding it, the weapon is not considered unwieldy. For example, a kasatha wielding a flame spinner in two of her hands while her other two hands remain empty treats the weapon as though it does not have the unwieldy weapon special property.",
        "WeaponPropertiesFueled": "燃料 [Fueled]",
        "WeaponPropertiesFueledTooltip": "A fueled weapon has an integrated petrol tank and must be activated to function properly. This works like the powered weapon special property, except it uses petrol as a fuel source instead of a battery. Unlike a battery, petrol is permanently expended upon use and must be purchased rather than recharged.",
        "WeaponPropertiesGearArray": "Gear Array",
        "WeaponPropertiesGearArrayTooltip": "Your nanites shape themselves into a single piece of equipment, such as a weapon, tool, or cybernetic augmentation.",
        "WeaponPropertiesGrapple": "組み付き　[Grapple]",
        "WeaponPropertiesGrappleTooltip": "When wielding a grapple weapon, you can use it to perform a grapple combat maneuver without having your hands free. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll, and if you roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, you apply the weapon’s critical hit effect (if any) to the target.",
        "WeaponPropertiesGravitation": "重力 [Gravitation]",
        "WeaponPropertiesGravitationTooltip": "When you hit a target with a gravitation weapon, you can move that target the listed distance either toward you or away from you unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 weapon’s item level + your Dexterity bonus). If this movement would cause the target to move through a wall, object, or another barrier, the target creature stops moving, but it does not fall prone or take damage. If the movement would push the target off a cliff, into a trap, or otherwise move it into an area of obvious danger, the target must succeed at a second Reflex saving throw to stop its movement or be moved into the dangerous space. Movement caused by a gravitation weapon does not trigger attacks of opportunity.",
        "WeaponPropertiesGuided": "誘導 [Guided]",
        "WeaponPropertiesGuidedTooltip": "A guided weapon uses a signal along with wireless telemetry, magnetic guidance, or another means of guiding its payload after the weapon has been fired. When you take a move action to aim the weapon and then fire it on the same turn (including doing so with a sniper weapon), your target does not gain the bonus to AC provided by cover, partial cover, or soft cover. Improved cover and total cover still confer their bonuses normally.",
        "WeaponPropertiesHarrying": "攪乱 [Harrying]",
        "WeaponPropertiesHarryingTooltip": "A harrying weapon produces exceptionally distracting bursts of fire. When you take the harrying fire action with this weapon, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your attack roll.",
        "WeaponPropertiesHealing": "Healing",
        "WeaponPropertiesHealingTooltip": "A healing weapon, which must be an energy weapon, can deliver restorative energy. You can set the weapon to heal mode (or reset it to normal mode) as a move action. While in healing mode, if the healing weapon hits a creature, roll dice equal to the weapon’s damage; Weapon Specialization, an operative’s trick attack, and other effects that increase damage don’t apply. The creature recovers Hit Points equal to the amount rolled, minimum 1. Reduce healing by half for constructs and undead; objects are unaffected. A critical hit with a healing weapon doesn’t increase the healing or have a critical hit effect. A healing weapon used in healing mode expends twice the usual number of charges, and a battery used in a healing weapon can’t be recharged.",
        "WeaponPropertiesHolyWater": "聖水 [Holy Water]",
        "WeaponPropertiesHolyWaterTooltip": "A holy water weapon is infused with the blessings of one or more good-aligned deities (most commonly Hylax, Iomedae, or Sarenrae within the Pact Worlds, though devoted followers of any good-aligned deity could create such weapons). It damages only undead (regardless of alignment) and outsiders with the evil subtype, and even those creatures suffer no effect (and show no sign of their nature if it is not already obvious) with a successful saving throw. Crafting a holy water grenade requires the blessing of formally trained priests of a good deity, though a character of any alignment can do the actual crafting.",
        "WeaponPropertiesHybrid": "Hybrid",
        "WeaponPropertiesHybridTooltip": "A weapon with this special property is a hybrid item, incorporating both magic and technology into its design. It counts as a magical weapon and gains the analog weapon special property. It consumes ammunition and battery charges normally.",
        "WeaponPropertiesHydrodynamic": "Hydrodynamic",
        "WeaponPropertiesHydrodynamicTooltip": "This weapon can be thrown underwater effectively, taking no penalty to attack rolls or damage for underwater combat.",
        "WeaponPropertiesIgnite": "燃焼 [Ignite]",
        "WeaponPropertiesIgniteTooltip": "Weapons with the ignite special property use an accelerant to start small, intense fires on their targets. A target hit by a weapon with this special property must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the item’s level + your Dexterity bonus) or gains the burning condition with the listed amount of damage. Gaining the burning condition multiple times from the ignite special property does not increase your burning damage—you take only the highest listed ignite damage each round. A character who gains the burning condition through other means (such as the burn critical effect, even from a weapon with ignite) does add that damage to her burning damage each round. Ending the burning condition ends burning from all sources.",
        "WeaponPropertiesIndirect": "遠隔操作 [Indirect]",
        "WeaponPropertiesIndirectTooltip": "An indirect weapon uses a wireless signal along with a multistage firing system, internal telemetry, bimetallic fluctuation, magnetic guidance, or some other system to make it appear as if a shot from the weapon had been fired from a different location. This reduces the penalty to Stealth checks for sniping by 10.",
        "WeaponPropertiesInjection": "注入 [Inj]",
        "WeaponPropertiesInjectionTooltip": "This weapon or its ammunition can be filled with a drug; a contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury poison; or a medicinal compound. On a successful attack with the weapon (either the first attack if it’s a melee weapon or an attack with the relevant piece of ammunition if it’s a ranged weapon), the weapon automatically injects the target with the substance. Refilling the weapon with a new substance acts as reloading it and is a move action. Each different injectable material must be bought separately and can be used in any weapon with the injection special property. See page 231 for rules and prices for drugs, medicinals, and poisons.",
        "WeaponPropertiesInstrumental": "Instrumental",
        "WeaponPropertiesInstrumentalTooltip": "A weapon with this property can also be used as a basic musical instrument (Armory 105). The size of this instrument’s battery is the same as that of the weapon’s, and it can be used as a weapon (with the charge usage indicated) or an instrument (where it uses 1 charge every 10 minutes). If the weapon is 8th level or higher, it also functions instead as a euphonic musical instrument (Armory 106).",
        "WeaponPropertiesIntegrated": "付属武器 [Intgrtd]",
        "WeaponPropertiesIntegratedTooltip": "An integrated weapon can be wielded normally or installed in an armor upgrade slot. When properly installed, the weapon is considered to be wielded without needing to assign a number of hands to wield it. An integrated weapon requires the listed number of armor slots for proper installation. An android or any other creature with the upgrade slot racial ability cannot combine its racial upgrade slot with armor upgrade slots to install an integrated weapon. Installing, removing, or replacing an integrated weapon in a suit of armor takes 10 minutes, as if it were an armor upgrade.",
        "WeaponPropertiesLine": "透過 [Lin]",
        "WeaponPropertiesLineTooltip": "This weapon fires a projectile in a straight line that pierces through multiple creatures or obstacles. When attacking with such a weapon, make a single attack roll and compare it to the relevant Armor Class of all creatures and objects in a line extending to the weapon’s listed range increment. Roll damage only once. The weapon hits all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if an attack fails to damage a creature or obstacle hit in the line (typically due to damage reduction or hardness), the path is stopped and the attack doesn’t damage creatures farther away. A line weapon can’t damage targets beyond its listed range. If you score a critical hit, that effect applies only to the first target hit in the line, and you roll the critical damage separately. If multiple creatures are equally close, you choose which one takes the effects of the critical hit. A line weapon doesn’t benefit from feats or abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as the operative’s trick attack).",
        "WeaponPropertiesLiving": "生物 [Liv]",
        "WeaponPropertiesLivingTooltip": "Unlike simpler forms of biotech, a living weapon is not just organic material—it’s actually a simple living organism. The core function of a living weapon is based on the same scientific principles as manufactured weapons, but come about as part of its natural development and body function.<br><br>A living weapon can be affected by spells that target creatures, though it is mindless, incapable of independent action, and has no ability scores other than Constitution (which is always equal to its item level). It is subject to poisons and diseases, though it does not need to breath and is always protected as well as a creature with active environmental protection from armor. If it is forced to make a saving throw, its save bonus is always equal to its item level. If it suffers a condition that would normally cause it to take a penalty to attacks, damage, or save DCs, those penalties apply to any attack or effect created with it. Living weapons “eat” by absorbing part of the charges or fuel (or energy from some other form of ammunition) when fired. They do not sleep or breathe, cannot communicate in any way, are immune to pain effects due to their incredibly simple nervous systems, and are mindless.<br><br>If damaged, a living weapon can regain Hit Points from effects that restore Hit Points to living creatures, such as a mystic cure spell, and it regains a number of Hit Points equal to its item level each day. You can use the Life Science or Medicine skill instead of Engineering to repair a living weapon.",
        "WeaponPropertiesLockdown": "封鎖 [Lockdown]",
        "WeaponPropertiesLockdownTooltip": "A construct reduced to 0 Hit Points by a lockdown weapon is not destroyed but simply immobilized until it regains 1 or more Hit Points.",
        "WeaponPropertiesMindAffecting": "精神効果 [MindAfct]",
        "WeaponPropertiesMindAffectingTooltip": "A mind-affecting weapon affects only creatures with minds; targets that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this weapon. The damage from mind-affecting weapons is normally untyped, in which case it is affected by the same things that affect damage from the spell mind thrust. For example, if a creature was immune to mind thrust, it would also be immune to untyped damage from a mind-affecting weapon.",
        "WeaponPropertiesMine": "爆雷 [Mine]",
        "WeaponPropertiesMineTooltip": "A weapon with the mine special property is able to modify the ammunition fired from it to delay the detonation of its ordnance. Ammunition fired from this weapon (typically a grenade or mini-rocket) lands at the target grid intersection intact, detonating only when a creature moves into an adjacent square, or automatically detonating after 1d6+1 rounds have passed.",
        "WeaponPropertiesMire": "泥漿 [Mire]",
        "WeaponPropertiesMireTooltip": "A mire weapon has a defined area (generally a radius) that it temporarily turns into difficult terrain. Only a surface can be turned into difficult terrain (you can’t use a mire weapon to create difficult terrain in midair, for example), and the difficult terrain affects only the climb speed and land speed of creatures in the area.",
        "WeaponPropertiesModal": "切替 [Modal]",
        "WeaponPropertiesModalTooltip": "A modal weapon can be toggled to deal different types of damage, with the options listed in the weapon’s damage entry. The weapon can deal only one type of damage at a time; changing the weapon’s mode to deal another damage type requires a move action. The weapon category of a modal weapon is based on the first damage type listed. If its second damage type causes it to be considered a different category of weapon when dealing that damage, that category is listed in parentheses. For example, a modal weapon in the flame category that deals 1d6 fire damage or 1d6 cold damage lists “modal (cryo)” to indicate that when it is used to deal cold damage, it is treated as a weapon in the cryo category.",
        "WeaponPropertiesNecrotic": "死霊 [Necrotic]",
        "WeaponPropertiesNecroticTooltip": "A necrotic weapon deals cold damage infused with negative energy. Creatures immune to negative energy (such as the targets of a death ward spell) are immune to the cold damage of a necrotic weapon, and the cold damage of necrotic weapons affects only living creatures. Undead creatures targeted by a weapon with this property not only take no damage from the cold but also gain temporary Hit Points equal to the weapon’s item level. These temporary Hit Points last for 10 minutes, until expended, or until the undead gains a larger number of temporary Hit Points from a necrotic weapon. A creature can benefit from only one source of temporary Hit Points from a necrotic weapon at a time.",

        "WeaponPropertiesOneHanded": "片手持ち",
        "WeaponPropertiesOneHandedTooltip": "You can attack with a weapon (or threaten an area with it, for all melee weapons except unarmed strikes) only if you are wielding it with the correct number of hands. When the rules refer to wielding a weapon, it means you are holding a weapon with the correct number of hands and can thus make attacks with it. For example, if you are holding a small arm in your hand, you are considered to be wielding the weapon. If you are carrying a longarm in one hand or wearing a holstered weapon, you are not wielding it. You can carry a two-handed weapon in one hand, but you can’t make an attack with it while doing so.",
        "WeaponPropertiesOperative": "諜報 [Opv]",
        "WeaponPropertiesOperativeTooltip": "Lightweight and versatile, operative weapons take many forms, and they prove particularly effective in the hands of a trained combatant.

        "WeaponPropertiesPenetrating": "貫通 [Pnt]",
        "WeaponPropertiesPenetratingTooltip": "A penetrating weapon is designed to punch through large objects’ outer layers, making it easier to damage them. A penetrating weapon ignores an amount of hardness equal to the weapon’s level.",
        "WeaponPropertiesPolarize": "分極 [Polarize]",
        "WeaponPropertiesPolarizeTooltip": "A weapon with the polarize special property briefly builds up a polarized charge in a target.

This resets at the beginning of your next turn.",
        "WeaponPropertiesPolymorphic": "多様 [Polymorphic]",
        "WeaponPropertiesPolymorphicTooltip": "Melee weapons with the polymorphic weapon special property are made of a multitude of linked scales that can be reconfigured with a gesture. The wielder can cause the scales to flatten, form several contiguous sharp edges, or stand upright as a series of points. As a swift action or once as part of a full action, a creature wielding a polymorphic weapon can change its damage type from bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing to another of those types.",
        "WeaponPropertiesPowered": "動力消費 [Pwrd]",
        "WeaponPropertiesPoweredTooltip": "A melee weapon with an internal battery that must be charged to function has the powered special property, which lists its capacity and usage. Unlike with a ranged weapon, the usage is for 1 minute of operation rather than per attack, though using a powered weapon for less than 1 full minute still expends 1 full usage. The number of charges expended is equal to the usage × the number of minutes the weapon is used, rounded up to the nearest minute. You can activate the power of the weapon as part of the action used to make an attack with it, and it automatically deactivates after 1 minute.<br><br>As with ranged weapons, you can recharge the battery of a powered melee weapon using a generator or a recharging station, or you can purchase new batteries for it. If you try to attack with a powered weapon that’s out of charges, it functions as an improvised weapon (see page 169).",
        "WeaponPropertiesProfessional": "専門 [Professional]",
        "WeaponPropertiesProfessionalTooltip": "A professional weapon is a tool used in a specialized trade that nevertheless has tremendous damaging potential. When using a professional weapon, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks with the listed Profession skill (or to checks with similar skills that could reasonably use that weapon as part of the profession, subject to the GM’s discretion). If you have a number of ranks in the listed Profession skill equal to the item level, you are considered proficient with that weapon, even if you would not normally be. This proficiency never counts toward prerequisites of any kind.",
        "WeaponPropertiesPropel": "Propel",

When the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, she is exposed to dangerous radiation and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be inflicted with radiation sickness. (For radioactive blast weapons, the user must attempt a Fortitude save if any of the attacks are a natural 1). This is considered a low level of radiation.

A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the item’s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.

When a creature takes damage from a weapon with the scramble property, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the weapon’s level + the wielder’s Int modifier) or lose its ability to communicate telepathically until the end of your next turn. Abilities that depend on telepathic communication, such as the Swarm mind ability, also don’t function during this time.",
        "WeaponPropertiesShape": "シャープ [Shape]",
        "WeaponPropertiesShapeTooltip": "A weapon with the shape special property has a complex targeting array that allows it to target specified areas. If you make a single attack as a full action with such a weapon, you can exclude the listed number of squares from within this weapon’s area of effect. This means you can avoid shooting an ally in the area of a blast weapon’s effect, for example.",
        "WeaponPropertiesShatter": "Shatter",
        "WeaponPropertiesShatterTooltip": "The first time a weapon with this property is used on a target, the weapon has the penetrating special property. However, if the weapon’s damage is dealt to the same target continuously over subsequent rounds, the amount of Hardness the weapon ignores = 3 × the weapon’s item level.

When the rules refer to wielding a weapon, it means you are holding a weapon with the correct number of hands and can thus make attacks with it. For example, if you are holding a small arm in your hand, you are considered to be wielding the weapon. If you are carrying a longarm in one hand or wearing a holstered weapon, you are not wielding it. You can carry a two-handed weapon in one hand, but you can’t make an attack with it while doing so.",

        "WeaponPropertiesVariantBoost": "可変ブースト [VB]",
